  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonate typically is about 15 inches, but ranges from 12 to 24 inches.  Depth to underlying glacial till ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The natric horizon contains an estimated SAR or ESP of 10 to 20.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have an E horizon.\nThe B/E horizon has value of 5 or 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay having a clay content of 35 to 50 percent and less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline. Some pedons have a Btk horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay or silty clay loam and neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bk and 2By horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y hue, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  They commonly are clay loam, but are clay in some pedons.  They have few to many fine to coarse accumulations of carbonate and are slightly or moderately alkaline.  Gypsum and other salts are below horizons of maximum carbonate accumulations.  Shale chips range from few to many in the glacial till.  Some pedons have a 2C horizon."
