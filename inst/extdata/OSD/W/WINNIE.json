These soils are rarely flooded for very brief to brief periods. Flooding occurs as a result of storm surge during tropical storms which occurs in areas less than 4.6 m (15 ft) elevation. These soils frequently pond 2 to 8 cm (1 to 3 in) above the soil surface for long periods from January to March; have endosaturation from 22 to 203 cm (9 to 80 in) below the soil surface from January to March."
