  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wagonbox soils are on nearly level to gently sloping tableland landforms such as plateaus, mesas, and structural benches. They formed in alluvium and residuum derived from basalt, vitric tuff, and volcanic breccia. Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 1,555 to 2,015 meters. The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 410 mm, the mean annual temperature is 5.0 to 7.2 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 70 to 90 days."

Deunah soils are very fine, moderately deep to duripans, and have an abrupt textural change at the top of the argillic horizon. Hatpeak soils are fine, moderately deep to duripans, and have Mollic epipedons and argillic horizons. Squawcreek soils are clayey, shallow to lithic contacts, and have argillic horizons. Wickahoney soils are clayey-skeletal, shallow to lithic contacts, and have argillic horizons."
