  "OVERVIEW": "The Wagonbox series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum derived from basalt, vitric tuff, and volcanic breccia. Wagonbox soils are on plateaus and structural benches.  Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",

The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer.

Hatpeak soils are fine, moderately deep to duripans, and have Mollic epipedons and argillic horizons. Squawcreek soils are clayey, shallow to lithic contacts, and have argillic horizons. Wickahoney soils are clayey-skeletal, shallow to lithic contacts, and have argillic horizons."
