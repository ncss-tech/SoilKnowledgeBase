  "OVERVIEW": "The Waketickeh series consists of very shallow to bedrock, well drained soils formed in colluvium from marine basalt and associated volcanic rocks on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 60 to 100 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 140 inches and average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum throughout.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4, or 6 moist and 4 or 6 dry.
