  "OVERVIEW": "The Wauseon series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils that are moderately deep or deep to dense till. These soils formed in loamy and sandy glaciolacustrine sediments and in the underlying till. They are on lake plains, wave-worked till plains, and deltas. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.",

The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water ranges from 30 cm above the surface to 30 cm below the surface between January and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the loamy and sandy material, moderately low in the lower part of the subsoil formed in till, and low in the substratum."

A few undrained areas have dominantly marsh vegetation. Native vegetation is deciduous swamp forest with swamp white oak, soft maple, elm, basswood, and sycamore as prominent species."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 33 cm (Ap, A horizons).\nCambic horizon: from a depth of 33 to 91 cm (Bg, 2BC horizons).\nDensic contact: at 147 cm (top of the 2Cd horizon).\nAquic conditions: redox features present in all horizons below a depth of 33 cm; matrix color with chroma of 1 immediately below the mollic epipedon.\nThe Wauseon series needs to be investigated for a contrasting particle-size class during MLRA update activities. Available lab data from adjacent series have 27 to 42 percent clay in the underlying till.\nThe stratified substratum phase has stratified sand, loam, and clay loam in the substratum. This phase may be recorrelated into a new series when the area of use is updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
