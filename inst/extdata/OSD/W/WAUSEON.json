None of these soils have a strongly contrasting particle-size class. Corunna, Gilford, Goodell, Lyles, and Monon soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size class. Granby and Maumee soils have a sandy particle-size class. Mermill soils have a fine-loamy particle-size class."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wauseon soils are on lake plains and deltas of late Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in loamy and sandy glaciolacustrine sediments and in the underlying till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 720 to 960 mm. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 12 degrees C. Frost-free period is 135 to 210 days. Elevation is 183 to 244 meters."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Wauseon soils form a toposequence with the moderately well drained Rimer and Seward soils. Rimer and Seward soils are on higher landform positions. Other nearby soils on similar positions include the Colwood, Gilford, Granby, Hoytville, Lenawee, and Mermill soils. Colwood, Gilford, and Granby soils do not have till in the lower part of the profile. Hoytville, Lenawee, and Mermill soils have a thinner, dark colored surface layer."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained or very poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water ranges from 30 cm above the surface to 30 cm below the surface between January and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the loamy and sandy material, moderately low in the lower part of the subsoil formed in till, and low in the substratum."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Wauseon soils are cultivated. Principal crops include corn, soybeans, and small grain with some sugar beets and truck crops. A few undrained areas have dominantly marsh vegetation. Native vegetation is deciduous swamp forest with swamp white oak, soft maple, elm, basswood, and sycamore as prominent species."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 33 cm (Ap, A horizons).\nCambic horizon: from a depth of 33 to 91 cm (Bg, 2BC horizons).\nDensic contact: at 147 cm (top of the 2Cd horizon).\nAquic conditions: redox features present in all horizons below a depth of 33 cm; matrix color with chroma of 1 immediately below the mollic epipedon.\nThe Wauseon series needs to be investigated for a contrasting particle-size class during MLRA update activities. Available lab data from adjacent series have 27 to 42 percent clay in the underlying till.\nThe stratified substratum phase has stratified sand, loam, and clay loam in the substratum. This phase may be recorrelated into a new series when the area of use is updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
