    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to over 60 inches. The mollic epipedon is 24 to 35 inches thick.  The organic carbon has an irregular decrease with increasing depth.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 47 to 50 degrees F.  These soils are saturated with water at some period during the year, if not artificially drained.  The soils are neutral or mildly alkaline.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 30 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Rock fragments within the particle-size control section from a 0 to 15 percent.  Depth to the 2C horizon is 40 to over 60 inches.  Depth to redox concentrations is 10 to 30 inches.\nThe A and BA horizon have value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry and moist.  The BA horizon when present is silt loam or clay loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry and has few to common distinct and prominent mottles.  It is loam, clay loam or silty clay loam with thin horizons of sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  This horizon has moderate subangular blocky or prismatic structure.\nThe BC or BCg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or sandy loam and contains 0 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is loamy sand and contains 5 to 50 percent gravel."

The Coland, Comfrey, Delft, Glencoe and Romnell series have peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  Coland soils have a mollic epipedon 36 to 48 inches thick.  Comfrey soils have a mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline C horizon that contains free carbonates.  Delft soils have free carbonates at a depth of 24 to 36 inches.  Glencoe soils have a hue of 5Y or 2.5Y in the B horizon.  James Canyon soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section.  Kimmerling soils have a mollic epipedon 40 to 50 inches thick.  Excello soils have a mean annual temperature of over 54 degrees F.  Romnell soils have hue at 2.5Y or 5Y in the solum and have a C horizon with bulk density of about 1.7 grams per cubic centimeter.  Keddie soils average 40 to 50 percent sand in the particle-size control section."
