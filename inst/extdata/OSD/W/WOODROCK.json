  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: In undisturbed areas, these soils usually have 0i, 0e, and A horizons but these horizons are very thin or absent or may have been destroyed or mixed in some pedons. In severely truncated areas the E, E/B, and a portion of the Bt horizon has been destroyed but enough of the Bt horizon remains to be clearly identifiable. Thickness of the solum in undisturbed areas ranges from 15 to 40 inches and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The top of the argillic horizon occurs above 24 inches and textures are finer than loamy fine sand in some subhorizon above this depth. These soils are moderately to very strongly acid and base saturation is less than 60 percent in at least a part of the solum. Organic carbon is at a maximum in the surface horizons and decreases uniformly with depth. The argillic horizon averages 18 to 35 percent clay. Content of fine or coarser sand exceeds 35 percent and a significant proportion of the sand fraction is medium and coarse angular sand. Packing patterns of sand grains within the matrix tend to be cubical with bearing surfaces between sand grains relatively flat. Horizons of low organic matter content have a greater than normal differential in consistence between moist and dry conditions. Content of coarse fragments usually exceeds 15 percent and ranges up to 35 percent and these are mostly fine and very fine angular gravel. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 degrees to 46 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 40 degrees to 58 degrees F. if 0 horizons are thin and timber cover open, or 36 degrees to 46 degrees F. if 0 horizons are thick and timber stands are dense.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry and 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4. It is very strongly acid to moderately acid (pH 4.5 to 6.0). This horizon usually has platy primary structure but it has granular or crumb structure in some pedons. It is soft to slightly hard.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6. When hue is redder than 7.5YR, the coloration is inconsistent and limited to horizons of maximum weathering. This horizon is typically sandy clay loam but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 15 to 35 percent and sand from 40 to 75 percent with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand and with significant amounts of medium and coarse sand. It is strongly acid to moderately acid pH 4.5 to 6.0). The Bt horizon usually has subangular blocky primary structure but has angular blocky structure in some pedons. It has oriented clay films in some parts, and weak skeletons are present on faces of peds in the upper part of the horizon in some pedons."

The soil formed in moderately thin, noncalcareous, coarse sandy materials weathered residually from granite bedrock or on locally transported materials. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 24 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months. Mean annual temperature is 32 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 48 degrees F."
