  "OVERVIEW": "The Windowpeak series consists of very deep, well or somewhat excessively drained soils formed in colluvium and/or till derived from granite and granodiorite. Windowpeak soils are on moraines and mountain slopes in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Slopes range from 3 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1095 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
