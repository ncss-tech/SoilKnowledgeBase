  "OVERVIEW": "The Wredah series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Wredah soils are on hills and fan piedmonts remnants.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 275 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
