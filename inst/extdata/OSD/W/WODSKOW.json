The soils formed in stratified alluvium from mixed rock sources (high in quartz) and probably eolian material in the upper part.  The climate is semiarid and has relatively dry summr.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 to 11 inches.  The frost-free period is 100 to 140 days.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F."
