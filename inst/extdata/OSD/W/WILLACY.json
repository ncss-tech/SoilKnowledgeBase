  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 39 to 60 inches, and secondary lime occurs at depths of 36 to 50 inches\nbelow the surface.  Salinity ranges from none to as much as 8 mmhos/cm in areas irrigated with saline water.\nThe A horizon is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), or grayish brown (10YR 5/2).  Moist values are\nless than 3.5.  The A horizon is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy\nclay loam, and the reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B horizons are dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), grayish brown\n(10YR 5/2), dark brown (10YR 4/3), or brown (10YR 5/3).  Some\npedons are light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) or pale brown (10YR\n6/3) in the lower part.  They are fine sandy loam or sandy clay\nloam; clay content ranges from 18 to 33 percent.  Structure of\nthe B horizons ranges from weak to moderately prismatic and subangular blocky.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline in the upper part of the B horizon and moderately alkaline in the lower part.\nThe C horizon is pale brown (10YR 6/3) very pale brown (10YR 7/3)\nor light brownish gray (10YR 6/2).  Visible accumulation of\ncalcium carbonate in the C horizon ranges from 3 to 5 percent by volume and remains relatively constant with depth.\nCompeting Series:  There are no series in the same family.\nSimilar soils include Brennan, Clareville, Cuero, Czar, Duval,\nKlump, Parasol, Ramadero, Stoneburg, and Tela series.  Brennan\nand Duval soils contain less than 1 percent organic matter in the epipedon.  Clareville, Cuero, Czar, and Ramadero soils have\nmollic epipedons thicker than 20 inches.  Klump and Stoneburg\nsoils have mean annual soil temperatures less than 72 degrees F.  Parasol soils have a difference of less than 9 degrees F. between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures.  Tela soils\ncontain secondary lime at depths less than 34 inches."

The soil formed in alkaline, loamy sediments 10 feet or more\ndeep.  The climate is dry subhumid.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 34 inches and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 72 to 74 degrees F.  Annual Thornthwaite P-E index\nranges from 28 to 44."

Hidalgo and Raymondville soils are\ncalcareous throughout and in addition, Raymondville soils have\nmore than 35 percent clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Racombes soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick.\nAll these soils occur on similar surfaces.\nDrainage and Permeability:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.  Under irrigation, seasonal watertables accumulate\n5 to 8 feet below the surface."
