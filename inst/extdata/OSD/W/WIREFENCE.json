  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wirefence soils are on linear to concave summit and backslope positions of predominantly southeast to southwest-facing ridges and mountain slopes. Slopes are 5 to 50 percent. Elevations are 60 to 1000 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sandstone. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers with a marine layer influence and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1525 to 3050 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 280 days."
