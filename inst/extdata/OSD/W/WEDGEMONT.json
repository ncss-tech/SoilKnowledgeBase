The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The upper part of the particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.95 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to more than 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent, and averages 35 to 70 percent pumice and 0 to 5 percent pebbles.  The lower part of the particle-size control section averages 40 to 65 percent rock fragments.  Depth to the 2C horizon ranges from 20 to 36 inches.\nThe E horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of l or 2 dry or moist.  It is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe Bsl horizon has hue of 7.5YR or l0YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is very paragravelly ashy fine sandy loam, extremely paragravelly ashy fine sandy loam, very paragravelly ashy sandy loam, or extremely paragravelly ashy sandy loam.\nThe Bs2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or l0YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry or moist.

Wedgemont soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice over colluvium from gneiss and schist.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 22 degrees F; the mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F; and the mean annual air temperature is 39 to 42  degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees is l00 to l30 days."

Wedge soils lack the loamy contrasting material."
