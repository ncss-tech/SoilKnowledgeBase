  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wapal soils are on eskers, kame terraces, outwash terraces, and terrace escarpments. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. These soils formed in outwash mixed with minor amounts of volcanic ash and loess in the upper part. Elevation is 425 to 1,705 meters. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers, and cool, moist winters. The average annual precipitation is 400 to 700 mm. The average January temperature is about -5.0 degrees C, the average July temperature is about 17.8 degrees C, and the average annual temperature is 4.4 to 7.8 degrees C. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

Merkel soils are loamy-skeletal and are on mountains. Sacheen and Torboy soils are sandy. Goddard, Kiehl, Sacheen and Torboy soils are on similar landscapes as the Wapal soils. Nevine soils are on foothills and mountains."
