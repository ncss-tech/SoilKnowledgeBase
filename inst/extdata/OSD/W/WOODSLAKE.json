  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Woodslake series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils.  They formed in clayey, calcareous lacustrine sediments on glacial lake plains.  These soils have very slow permeability. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

(The A horizon in some pedons is slightly thinner but the upper 7 inches after mixing qualifies as a mollic epipedon.)\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2, or is N 2/0.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay.  Some pedons have enough organic carbon to use a mucky modifier.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or is neutral; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
