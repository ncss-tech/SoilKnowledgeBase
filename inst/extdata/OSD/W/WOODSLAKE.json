  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to carbonates ranges from 11 to 24 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 9 inches thick.  (The A horizon in some pedons is slightly thinner but the upper 7 inches after mixing qualifies as a mollic epipedon.)\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2, or is N 2/0.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay.  Some pedons have enough organic carbon to use a mucky modifier.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or is neutral; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Competing series and other updates will be made later.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to MAES central file code No. 3747 for results of some laboratory analysis of this series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
