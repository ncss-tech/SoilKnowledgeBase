  "OVERVIEW": "The Weglike soils consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over residuum derived from volcanic rocks.  Weglike soils are on lava plains and lava plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
