These soils are usually dry in all parts below 8 inches more than half the time when the soil is warmer than 41 degrees F. (about 105 to 130 days).  Depth to the duripan is 10 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 20 to 35 percent clay and 35 to 50 percent coarse fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe AB horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly loam, very gravelly clay loam, or very cobbly clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe duripan is indurated, has gravelly to extremely gravelly matrix, 8 to 36 inches thick with 1 to 5 inches thick silica plates and is above weakly to strongly cemented gravelly alluvium."

Brock soils have a Bk horizon below the Bt horizon and have soil temperatures of 47 to 49 degrees F.  Deepeek soils have a Bqk horizon below the Bt horizon and have soil temperature of 47 to 51 degrees F.  Hotcreek soils have a Btk horizon, bedrock at 8 to 14 inches and soil temperature of 49 to 52 degrees F.  Lapon soils have a Btk horizon and have bedrock at depths of 10 to 40 inches.  Melmesa soils have bedrock at  less than 20 inches and are moist for 10 to 20 days following the summer solstice.  Oleman soils have silica-laminae less than 1 inch thick in the Bkqm horizon, and soil temperature ranges from 55 to 58 degrees F.  Shinnpeak soils have silica-laminae 3mm thick or less in the Bkqm horizon and soil temperature ranges from 55 to 58 degrees F.  Troughs soils have a Btkq horizon and have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Vinini soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches."

Elevations are 1,000 to 1,800 feet.  These soils are in an arid climate with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 9 inches.  The mean January temperature is 29 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is about 71 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 49 to 53 degrees F.
