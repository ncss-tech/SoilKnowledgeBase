  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 35 to 45 degrees F. and the average summer soil temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F. under an O horizon. The water table is near the surface during late winter and early spring and increases in depth during the summer. The sola are two to four feet thick and depth to bedrock is more than five feet. Extractable Fe ranges from 1 percent in the A1 horizon to 0.5 percent in the C horizon. These soils are 62 to 92 percent base-saturated. Hard angular rock fragments average from 36 to 50 percent and are as high as 80 percent in the C horizon. These soils have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 in the upper part and 2 or 3 in the lower part. It averages 6 to 9 percent organic carbon in the upper 10 inches and an air dry bulk density of 0.85 to 1 gram per cc. This horizon has 65 to 70 percent silt and 12 to 18 percent clay.\nThe Bw horizon has an air dry bulk density of 1.26 to 1.32. It has 50 to 65 percent silt and 4 to 10 percent clay.\nThe 2C horizon has 37 to 50 percent silt and 2 to 10 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wishard soils are on concave moderately steep and steep mountain slopes and in concave sloping basins at elevations ranging from 4,000 to 7,000 feet. The soils formed in residuum and colluvium from argillites and quartzites of the Belt series. The cool subhumid climate has a mean annual temperature of 35 to 43 degrees F. and a mean annual precipitation of 50 to 70 inches. Summers are cool and dry and winters are cold and moist with considerable snow. Average July temperature is 63 degrees F. and average January temperature is 22 degrees F."

Coerock and Holloway soils have thin loess mantles, rich in volcanic glass. Coerock soils are shallow over hard rock. Holloway soils have white horizons beneath the loess mantle."
