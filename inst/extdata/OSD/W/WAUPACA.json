  "STATES": "MN,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Waupaca series consists of deep, poorly drained soils formed in silty water-laid deposits on basins of glacial lakes and flood plains.  These soils have moderately slow or moderate permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free carbonates ranges from 15 to 40 inches.  The control section ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Ap or A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, silt, or very fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have an AC horizon.\nThe C horizon has 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y hue, or is neutral; value is 4 to 6, and chroma is 0 to 2 above a depth of 20 inches and 0 to 6 below a depth of 20 inches.  Textures are commonly silt, silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or very fine sand or is stratified with these textures.  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages between 2 and 18 percent clay and from 1 to 10 percent fine sand or coarser."

Keowns soils are coarse-loamy and mesic.  Shiocton and Wega soils do not have horizons that are dominated by chroma of 2 or less within a depth of 20 inches."
