  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free carbonates ranges from 15 to 40 inches.  The control section ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Ap or A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, silt, or very fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have an AC horizon.\nThe C horizon has 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y hue, or is neutral; value is 4 to 6, and chroma is 0 to 2 above a depth of 20 inches and 0 to 6 below a depth of 20 inches.  Textures are commonly silt, silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or very fine sand or is stratified with these textures.  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages between 2 and 18 percent clay and from 1 to 10 percent fine sand or coarser."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Keowns soils are coarse-loamy and mesic.  Shiocton and Wega soils do not have horizons that are dominated by chroma of 2 or less within a depth of 20 inches."

Mean annual temperature is estimated to range from 40 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 32 inches."

Some areas were cleared but are now in idle cropland because of drainage system failures.  The native vegetation was swamp hardwoods with some grasses and sedges."
