  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 18 to 30 inches. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. Depth to free carbonates ranges from 0 to 12 inches. Reaction throughout the profile is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline. The control section contains more than 50 percent fine or coarser sand.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the upper part and fine sand or sand in the lower part. Strata of finer or coarser textured material are common in this horizon. Some pedons lack fine sand or sand horizons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Waldeck series is the only series in this family. Competing soils in other families are Kaski, Lesho, Plevna, Wann, and Zenda series. Kaski soils are fine-loamy and have a thicker mollic epipedon. Lesho soils have contrasting texture within the control section. Plevna soils are more poorly drained. Wann soils are mesic. Zenda soils are fine-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Waldeck soils are on high flood plains or low terraces of large streams. The slope gradient ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in alluvium that commonly is loamy in the upper part and sandy in the lower part. The mean annual temperature varies from 57 to 60 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation varies from 20 to 35 inches. Thornthwaites Annual P-E Index ranges from 32 to 54."

Kanza soils are more poorly drained and are on slightly lower positions. Kaski, Lesho, Plevna, and Zenda soils are on similar topographic positions as Waldeck soils."
