The fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal Imano soils contain more clay in the upper part of the profile. They are on similar positions. The sandy textured Yaggy soils do not have a mollic epipedon, and are typically finely stratified with loamy textures above 19 inches (48 centimeters). They are generally slightly lower on the flood plain."
