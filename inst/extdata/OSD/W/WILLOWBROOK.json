  "OVERVIEW": "The Willowbrook series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils on flood plains in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). They formed in loamy alluvium over sand. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 29 inches (74 centimeters), and the mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F (13 degrees C).",

The sandy textured Yaggy soils do not have a mollic epipedon, and are typically finely stratified with loamy textures above 19 inches (48 centimeters). They are generally slightly lower on the flood plain."
