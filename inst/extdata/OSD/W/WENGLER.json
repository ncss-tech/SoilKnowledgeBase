  "OVERVIEW": "The Wengler series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in tephra deposited over basaltic lava flows.  Wengler soils are on lava plateaus, hills, and escarpments.  Slopes range from 5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
