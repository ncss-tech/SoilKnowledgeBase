    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Borth, Kaukauna, Kewaunee, Manawa, Omro, and Poygan soils.  The Borth soils occupy the same position on the landscape.  The somewhat poorly drained Manawa and poorly drained Poygan soils are in drainageways that separate slightly higher areas of Winneconne.  Kaukauna soils occupy similar landscape positions as Winneconne.  Kewaunee soils, which have less than 60 percent clay in their control section, are nearby on glacial till uplands.  Omro soils are clayey over loamy."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low to moderately low (0.01 to 0.42 micrometers per second). Permeability is very slow. These soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 46 to 107 cm (1.5 to 3.5 feet) for 1 month or more per year in 6 or more out of 10 years."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Winneconne soils were previously classified with the very-fine, mixed, mesic family of Typic Argiudolls, but this was found to be unsatisfactory because the thickness requirements for the mollic epipedon did not occur in a majority of the pedons mapped in the field.\n12/04  This revision redefines the Winneconne series as moderately well drained only (Mollic Ozyaquic Hapludalfs). A new series (Mollic Hapludalf) is needed for the well drained areas when those areas are updated.\nLab data is needed (Cole) to determine if this soil is in a Vertic subgroup.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - 0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 inches) (Ap); argillic horizon - 18 to 56 cm (7 to 22 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3);  mollic subgroup  Ap horizon with color value and chroma, moist, less than 4 and color value, dry, less than 6; oxyaquic feature  redox features and saturation within 102 cm (40 inches) for 1 month or more per year in 6 or more out of 10 years.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
