  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Sulfur content ranges from 0.7 to 2.4 percent in the Oa2 and Oa3 horizons.  The organic material in all tiers is dominantly sapric material, but in some pedons, hemic material occurs.  Conductivity of the saturation extract above the C ranges from about 200 to 400 mmho/cm.  Reaction of the Oa horizons ranges from extremely acid to neutral in the natural state and from extremely acid to slightly acid after drying.  Reaction of the Cg horizon in the natural state ranges from extremely acid to slightly alkaline and from extremely acid to moderately acid after drying.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 3 or less.  Mineral content ranges up to 80 percent.  Texture is muck.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, or gray range from none to many.  Content of shell fragments range from 0 to 20 percent, by volume.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, their gravelly or mucky analogs."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in moderately thick deposits of hydrophytic plant remains and sandy marine sediments containing shell fragments.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches, and the average annual temperature ranges from 70 to 74 degrees F."
