  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mineral soil over the organic soil material ranges from 40 to 100 centimeters thick. Bedrock is deeper than 150 centimeters. Rock fragments are lacking in most pedons but some pedons contain up to 20 percent gravel in the mineral horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, or fine sandy loam. Some pedons have a mucky modifier. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse granular, and consistence is friable or very friable. Undisturbed areas have an A horizon 7 to 15 centimeters thick. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is dominantly silt loam or loam but permits fine sandy loam and silty clay loam subhorizons in the fine earth fraction. Some pedons have a mucky modifier. Structure is weak or moderate, subangular blocky, or prismatic. It is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nCg horizons have the same range in color and texture as the Bg horizon. Some pedons have buried A horizons above the organic layers. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2O horizons have hues of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. They consist of hemic or sapric materials and include either woody or herbaceous plant material or both. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly alkaline.\n3C horizons of marl or coprogenus earth commonly underlie the organic layers, but some pedons have clayey, silty or sandy 3C horizons. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately alkaline depending on the type deposits in the substratum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wallkill soils formed in alluvial mineral soil deposits over organic soil materials. They occur along streams that run through organic soil areas and along the margins of depressional areas adjacent to upland mineral soils. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 760 to 1270 millimeters and mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees Celsius. Mean growing season ranges from 130 to 200 days in the regions of occurrence though some areas of the soil are in frost pockets."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Carlisle, Hamlin, Lupton, Middlebury, Palms, Teel, Tioga, Warners, and Wayland soils. Carlisle, Lupton, and Palms soils formed in associated organic deposits. Middlebury, Teel, Tioga, Wayland and Warners soils formed in mineral deposits on floodplains and lack organic materials within the control sections."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained, naturally, though effective drainage of many areas has been established by ditches. The potential for surface runoff is low to negligible. Saturated hydraulic conducticity of the mineral portion is moderately high to high, and the organic portion is high to very high."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Where drained, Wallkill soils are used for growing potatoes, lettuce, celery and other vegetable crops. A significant area is used for sod-production for lawns. Corn is produced locally. Partially drained areas are used for hay and pasture. Wooded areas have elm, red maple and other water-tolerant species."
