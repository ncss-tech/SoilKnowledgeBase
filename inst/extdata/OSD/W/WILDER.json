  "OVERVIEW": "The Wilder series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits with a minor component of volcanic ash and loess.  These soils are on backslopes and terrace escarpments.  Slopes are 35 to 65 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 22 inches and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
