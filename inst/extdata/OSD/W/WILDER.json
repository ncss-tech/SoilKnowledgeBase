These soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  Elevations are from 2,500 to 3,410 feet.  These soils are in a xeric climate with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 20 inches.  Average January temperature ranges from 22 to 26 degrees F., the average July temperature ranges from 62 to 67 degrees F., and the average annual temperature is 40 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 130 days."
