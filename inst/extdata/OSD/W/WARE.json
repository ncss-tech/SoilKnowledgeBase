  "OVERVIEW": "The Ware series consists of well drained soils formed in loamy alluvium on flood plains. They have moderate permeablity in the solum and moderately rapid to rapid\nin the underlying material. Slope gradients range from 1 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches and mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees\nF.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

The lower part\nof the control section has a high percentage of sand but, because of the amount of very fine sand, it is not a strongly contrasting particle size class. The dominant size\nof sand in the control section is very fine.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. The texture is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or\nmedium granular.\nThe Bw horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4 except that chroma of 2 is allowed with value of 3 in pedons where\nmixing with surface horizons has occurred. The texture is loam or very fine sandy loam. The structure is fine or medium subangular blocky. The lower part in some\npedons is stratified with coarser textured or finer textured strata.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 or more. It commonly is stratified and ranges from silt loam to sand but dominantly very fine\nsandy loam to fine sand. The C horizon is commonly neutral but some pedons are slightly alkaline and contain carbonates."

The soils formed in moderately fine textured loamy sediments that generally are stratified below about 15 inches. The underlying material normally grades to\nsandy with depth. Climate consists of hot summers and cold winters. Mean annaul temperature ranges from 57 to 64 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 40\nto 48 inches.
