  "OVERVIEW": "The Wykeham series consist of deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy loam glacial till.  These soils are typically on ground moraines and end moraines in the uplands.  They have moderately slow or moderate permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum and depth to free carbonates ranges from 20 to 50 inches.  These soils typically have 2 to 30 percent coarse fragments throughout the profile.  Coarse fragments are of mixed lithology and are pebble to cobblestone in size.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 (6 through 8 dry), and chroma of 2 through 4.  Typically it is sandy loam, but fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand and loamy sand are within the range.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nMost pedons have either an EB, B/E, or BE transitional horizons with some characteristics of both horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 8, with few to many faint to prominent mottles.  It is sandy clay loam, loam, or sandy loam but may have subhorizons of fine sandy loam. The clay content ranges from 18 to 30 percent and sand content ranges from 45 to 65 percent.  The upper part may have clean silt and sand grains on the faces of peds.  Clay films range from faint to prominent and few to many.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6 and it commonly is mottled.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.  It commonly has calcium carbonate concretions or masses.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 20 percent."

Alstad soils typically have redder hues in Bt and C horizons, have value of 6 or more in the Ap horizon or equivalent and have higher rainfall.  Beltrami soils formed in finer textured till with higher silt content.  Bonduel soils have dolomite bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Eckvoll soils have sandy sediments over the till.  Garnes soils have sola less than 20 inches thick."
