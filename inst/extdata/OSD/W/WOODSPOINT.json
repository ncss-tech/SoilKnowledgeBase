The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 to 45 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is less than 46 degrees F. The particle-size control section averages 10 to 25 percent clay (field estimated), less than 35 percent rock fragments, and 0 to 5 percent pararock fragments. It has a phosphate-retention of greater than 85 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 2.0 to 4.0 percent, 2 to 15 cmol(+)/kg KCl extractable aluminum, and 20 to 30 percent 15-bar moisture (air dried sample). Moist bulk density is 0.75 to 0.90 g/cubic centimeter. Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. Soil reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry. The fine-earth texture is medial silt loam or medial loam and has 10 to 25 percent field estimated clay. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 15 percent paragravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist, 4 to 8 dry.

Hobit soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact and have a xeric soil moisture regime. Mulkey soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Hobit and Mulkey soils have umbric epipedons greater than 20 inches thick. Verlot soils are moderately deep to compacted glacial till (Cd horizon) and are moderately well drained."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Woodspoint soils occur in the area along the summit of the Coast Range. The soils are on ridgetops and side slopes of mountains. They are on slopes of 5 to 60 percent. The soils are formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt or coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock. Elevations are 2,800 to 4,100 feet. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 120 to 150 inches. The mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F. The frost free period is 40 to 100 days."
