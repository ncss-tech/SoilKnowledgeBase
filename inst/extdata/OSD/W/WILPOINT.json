  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wilpoint series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in slowly or very slowly permeable clayey lacustrine sediments.  They are gently sloping to sloping soils on bedrock controlled landforms.  Wilpoint soils typically have dark grayish brown silty clay loam A horizons; mottled dark brown and dark grayish brown silty clay and clay B horizons, and dark gray clay C horizons overlying massive level bedded limestone bedrock.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Coarse fragments are commonly lacking in the A and B horizons but range up to 5 percent in some pedons.  Reaction is medium acid to neutral in the A and B horizons and neutral to moderately alkaline in the Bt, if present, and the C.  The C horizon contains free carbonates.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay.  It has moderate or strong, very fine to coarse granular or blocky structure.  Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4 and is mottled.  Chroma of 2 is lithochromic and not indicative of wetness.  Texture is clay with thin silty clay subhorizons with average clay content of 60 percent or more.  It has moderate or strong, very fine to coarse, angular or subangular blocky structure or primary structure is prismatic parting to blocky.  Consistence is friable or firm, sticky or firm, sticky or very sticky and plastic or very plastic.\nBC or C horizons have hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The B horizon has blocky or subangular blocky structure.  The C horizon is massive or has coarse prismatic structure.  Texture is clay or silty clay."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Similar soils in related families are the Broughton, Chaumont, Covington, Guffin, Kingsbury, Livingston, and Vergennes.  Broughton, Covington, Kingsbury, Livingston and Vergennes soils are more than 1 meter deep to bedrock and have illitic mineralogy.  Chaumont soils have argillic horizons that are dominated by colors with chroma of 2.  Guffine soils have aquic moisture regimes, lack argillic horizons and are dominated by 2 chroma colors throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wilpoint are gently sloping to sloping soils with slopes ranging from 3 to 15 percent.  The Wilpoint soils are on convex landscapes where relatively thin clayey marine sediments overlie hard bedrock.  The bedrock is primarily limestone with some areas underlain by granite, sandstone or shale.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F; mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 44 inches and mean annual growing season from 120 to 160 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the somewhat poorly drained Chaumont and the poorly drained and very poorly drained Guffin soils which are in a drainage sequence with Wilpoint and the competing Covington, Kingsbury, Livingston and Vergennes soils.  Also associated are the Benson, Newstead and Rhinebeck soils.  Benson and Newstead are shallow and moderately deep soils occurring on adjacent bedrock controlled till landscapes.  Rhinebeck soils are deep soils developed in lacustrine materials that contain slightly smaller amounts of clay."

    "content": "REMARKS:  This draft changes the classification of the Wilpoint series from very fine, illitic, mesic Glossaquic Hapludalfs to very fine, mixed, mesic Aquic Hapludalfs.  Investigations have shown that the A part of the upper part of the B horizon has chroma that is too high and thickness that is less than 1 millimeter thick on abutting ped surfaces.  Mineralogy is changed based on samples from the closely associated Chaumont and Guffin soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
