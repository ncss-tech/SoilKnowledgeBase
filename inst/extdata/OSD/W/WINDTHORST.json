  "OVERVIEW": "The Windthorst series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in sandy and clayey residuum weathered from claystone and sandstone of Cretaceous age. These very gently sloping to strongly sloping soils occur on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of ridges on hills. Slope range is 1 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).",
