  "OVERVIEW": "The Wetvit series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from pyroclastic volcanic rocks.  Wetvit soils are on narrow flood plains on plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
