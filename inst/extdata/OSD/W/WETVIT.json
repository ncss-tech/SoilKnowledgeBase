  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevations range from 1,300 to 1,900 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 230 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between the soil surface and 46 cm (very shallow and shallow free water occurrence classes) between January and May.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  These soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for brief periods or frequent flooding for long periods mainly between January and May."
