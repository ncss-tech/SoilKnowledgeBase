  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the argillic horizon is 28 to 55 inches.  Solum thickness is less than 60 inches.  Depth to hard bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The soil is very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout, unless limed.  Content of rock fragments, ranges from 0 to 65 percent in the A and E horizons, and 0 to 35 percent in the Bt and C horizons.  Flakes of mica range from none to common throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons have A horizons 1 inch thick or less with value of 2.   The A horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8.  The upper few inches of this horizon may include hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Mottles in shades of brown or yellow are in some pedons.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 to 8.  Mottles in shades of brown or yellow are in some pedons.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 6 to 8.  Mottles in shades of brown or yellow are in some pedons.  Black or brown rock fragments are in some pedons.  It is sandy loam, loam, or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction with as much as 90 percent soft saprolite."

Brevard soils have thicker sola.  Evard soils have a thinner argillic horizon.  Braddock and Hayesville soils are in clayey families.  Chester, Clymer, Colts Neck, Edgemont, Edneytown, Eubanks, Fairfax, Glenelg, Rayne and Tate soils have mixed mineralogy.  Fannin soils have micaceous mineralogy.  Jefferson soils have siliceous mineralogy."
