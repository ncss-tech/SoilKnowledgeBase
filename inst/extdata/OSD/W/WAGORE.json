  "OVERVIEW": "The Wagore series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from granitic rocks with surficial additions of loess.  Wagore soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
