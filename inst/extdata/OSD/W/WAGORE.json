Kabear soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Lobert soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have durinodes in horizons below the particle-size control section.  Ola and Prucree soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Shively soils are deep to paralithic contacts, average less than 15 percent rock fragments, and are not dominated by fine granitic gravel in the particle-size control section.  Taterpa soils are deep to paralithic contacts and have a xeric moisture regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wagore soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium derived from granitic rocks with surficial additions of loess.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,465 to 2,380 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 75 days."
