  "OVERVIEW": "The Whitefield Series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in reclaimed material from coal strip mines.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on strip mines in the Arkansas Ridges and Valley land resource area.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 56 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches.",
