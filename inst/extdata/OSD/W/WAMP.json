  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wamp soils are on fan remnants and ballenas. Slope ranges from 4 to 50 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone. Elevations are 1460 to 2150 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, intermittently moist summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to Great Basin. The mean annual precipitation is 175 to 225 millimeters; mean annual air temperature is 8 to 13 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 90 to 180 days."
