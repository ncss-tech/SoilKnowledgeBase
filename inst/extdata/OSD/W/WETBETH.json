This soil has an apparent water table that fluctuates from 30 inches below the surface in the wet seasons to more than 60 inches below the surface in the dry seasons.  The 10 to 40 inch control section ranges from 35 to 50 percent clay content.  These soils have cracks within 125 cm of the soil surface that are 5 mm or more wide through a thickness of 30 cm or more for some time in most years, and slickensides in a layer 15 cm or more thick that has its upper boundary within 125 cm of the soil surface and/or a linear extensibility of 6.0 cm or more between the mineral soil surface and a depth of 100 cm.  This soil stays wet long enough that cracks do not open and close periodically to the surface.  Reaction is moderately alkaline throughout.  Depth to visible calcium carbonate ranges from 0 to 20 inches.  Depth to visible gypsum ranges from 20 to 50 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam or clay loam.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Brewer, Brewless, Dilworth, Piedmont, Renthin and Westsum series in the same family, and the Bethany series in a similar family.  Brewer and Brewless soils are on floodplains and do not have a water table within 6 feet of the soil surface.  Dilworth and Piedmont soils have shale bedrock within 40 inches of the surface.  Renthin soils have shale bedrock within 60 inches of the soil surface.  Westsum soils do not have a water table within 60 inches of the soil surface.  Bethany soils do not decrease in clay content by more than 20 percent from the maximum within 60 inches, lack a water table within 72 inches, and COLE is less than 0.07."
