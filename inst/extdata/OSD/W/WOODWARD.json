  "OVERVIEW": "The Woodward series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from sandstone bedrock of Permian age. These soils occur on very gently sloping to steep interfluves and side slopes of hillslopes, ridges and escarpments in the Central Rolling Red Plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
