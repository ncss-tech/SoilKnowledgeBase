The particle-size control section averages 20 to 30 percent rock fragments and 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A1 horizon has values of 4 or 5 dry.\nThe A2 horizon has values of 4 or 5 dry.  It is ashy loam or gravelly ashy sandy loam.  It has 5 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe AB horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wenner soils are on hillslopes and terraces and have slopes of 15 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in till and slope alluvium from metamorphic and metaigneous rock with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  Elevations are 2,400 to 3,500 feet.  The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 23 to 28 degrees F.; The average July temperature ranges from 63 to 68 degrees F.; and the average annual air temperature is 45 to 52 F.; and the frost free season ranges from 100 to 130 days."
