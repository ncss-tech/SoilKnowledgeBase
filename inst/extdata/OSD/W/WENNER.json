  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wenner series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed till and colluvium from metamorphic and metaigneous rock with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  These soils are on hillslopes and terraces.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
