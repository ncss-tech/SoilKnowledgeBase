  "OVERVIEW": "The Wildcatbutte series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from basalt or welded tuff.  Wildcatbutte soils are on lava plateaus, hills, or mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
