    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cavin, Cinderfall, Crackedground, and Nutzan series.\nCavin soils have soil reaction of moderately acid or slightly acid in the upper subhorizons of the epipedon and do not have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates.  Cinderfall soils are dominated by gravel-size basaltic cinders in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Crackedground soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Nutzan soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wildcatbutte soils are on lava plateaus, hills, or mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from basalt or welded tuff.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  Elevations range from 1,220 to 1,770 meters feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 330 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
