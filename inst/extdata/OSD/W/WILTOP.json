    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wiltop soils are on mountain ridges and shoulders. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from welded tuff. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 2,400 to 2,750 meters. The climate is moist subhumid with cold wet winters and warm dry summer. Precipitation in the form of snow is regularly removed by high winds. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 500 mm. The mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C. and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."
