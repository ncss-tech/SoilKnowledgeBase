Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in each horizon.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Mottles are in shades of gray and brown. Mottles of chroma 2 or less are present within the upper 24 inches of this soil.  The texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.   In the particle size control section, clay content averages between 25 and 35 percent, sand content between 5 and 25 percent and silt content is 40 percent or more.\nThe C horizon is mottled or has matrix colors in hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Mottles with high value and chroma are in most pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to6.  Mottles are in shades of gray, brown or yellow.  Some pedons are mottled without a dominant matrix color.  silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay loam."

Chagrin soils lack mottles of chroma 2 or less within 24 inches and have mixed mineralogy.  Lindside soils are fine loamy and have mixed mineralogy.  Hamblen soils are thermic.  Weaver soils are calcareous and contain marly material and lime nodules."
