  "OVERVIEW": "The Woodleaf series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material from ultramatic rocks with a large amount of serpentine minerals.  Woodleaf soils are on mountains and have slopes of 3 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 65 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees.",
