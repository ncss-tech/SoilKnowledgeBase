Depth to the top of the fragipan ranges from 41 to 66 cm (16 to 26 in) below the mineral surface. Rock fragments, dominantly channers and flagstones, range from 5 to 35 percent by volume in the mineral soil above the fragipan, from 15 to 60 percent in the fragipan; and from 15 to 70 percent below the fragipan. The fine-earth fraction of the Bx and C horizons has over 50 percent silt plus very fine sand. Redoximorphic features are present beginning at a depth of 30 to 61 cm (12 through 24 in) below the mineral surface.\nSome pedons have an O horizon that is slightly (fibric) or moderately (hemic) decomposed plant material.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam. Structure is weak or moderate, granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction, in unlimed areas, ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction, in unlimed areas, ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nIn some pedons an E horizon is present above the Bx horizon with hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, fine sandy loam, or loam. Reaction, in unlimed areas, ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam. Structure is coarse or very coarse prismatic with platy, blocky, or massive interiors. Consistence is firm or very firm, and is brittle. Common or many redoximorphic concentrations are present. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with colors and textures similar to the B and C horizons.\nThe C horizon, or Cd horizon if present, is massive, with color and texture similar to the Bx horizon. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Pinckney series is in the same family. Pinckney soils have a lithologic discontinuity above the fragipan.\nThe Bath, Lackawanna, Lewbeach, Lewbath, Mardin, Newfound, Onteora, Ontusia, Shelburne, Simoda, Willowemoc, and Wellsboro series are similar soils in related families. Bath, Lackawanna, Mardin, and Wellsboro soils have a mesic temperature regime. Lewbeach and Lewbath soils lack redoximorphic features above the fragipan and have a semiactive cation exchange activity class. Newfound soils are superactive, have thinner sola and have sandy loam textures above the fragipan. Onteora and Ontusia soils have an aquic moisture regime. Shelburne soils are oxyaquic and have rock fragments dominated by schist and siliceous limestone. Simoda soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section. Willowemoc soils are semiactive and, have hues of 2.5YR or 5YR in the lower subsoil (fragipan) and the substratum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Willdin soils are on uplands of glaciated dissected plateaus and till plains and are mainly on slightly convex hilltops and hillsides. Slope is commonly from 0 to 25 percent but the range includes up to 35 percent. The soils developed in firm till derived from sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 9 degrees C (39 to 48 degrees F). Annual precipitation ranges from 825 to 1790 mm (32 to 70 in) and the frost free days range from 110 to 155 days. Elevation ranges from 425 to 1100 m (1394 to 3608 ft) above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Willdin soils are the moderately well drained member of a drainage sequence which includes the well-drained Lewbath soils, the somewhat poorly drained Ontusia soils, and the poorly drained Norchip soils. Moderately deep, well drained Mongaup soils, and well drained, moderately deep or deep Cuyler (T) soils, and shallow, somewhat excessively drained and well drained Hawksnest soils are closely associated on nearby landforms where the soil mantle is thinner over bedrock. Valois soils are on adjacent sides of valleys where the till is less dense."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the mineral part of the soil above the fragipan and low or moderately low in the fragipan and the substratum."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Cleared areas are used for growing corn for silage, small grains, hay, and pasture. A significant acreage has reverted to woodland or brush. Native vegetation is sugar maple, American beech, northern red oak, black cherry, and white ash. Brush areas often contain blueberry, spirea, Hawthorne (thorn apple), and poplar."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This series is the frigid equivalent of the Mardin series, and the brown colored equivalent of the Willowemoc series. Original classification of Willdin placed it in the subgroup Typic Fragiochrepts, but because of changes established in the 8th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy this soil now classifies in the subgroup of Typic Fragiudepts.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 18 cm (7 in) (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 18 to 43 cm (7 to 17 in) (Bw and E horizons).\n3. Fragipan - within the upper 100 cm of the mineral surface-the zone from 43 to 112 cm (17 to 44 in) (Bx1, Bx2, and Bx3 horizons).\n4. Udic soil moisture regime.\n5. CEC activity class of active based on the average CEC7/TC ratio for two pedons (S85NY077-03 & S86NY077-11)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Cornell University Soil Characterization Lab data is available for this pedon (S86NY077-11), and for another pedon from Otsego County, New York (S85NY077-03).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
