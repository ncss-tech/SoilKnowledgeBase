  "OVERVIEW": "The Willdin series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on uplands at higher elevations in MLRA 140. They formed in till derived from brownish or gray colored sandstone, siltstone, and shale. A dense fragipan is present starting at a depth of 41 through 66 cm (16 through 26 in) below the soil surface. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual temperature is 7 degrees C (45 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is 1120 mm (44 in).",

Pinckney soils have a lithologic discontinuity above the fragipan.\nThe Bath, Lackawanna, Lewbeach, Lewbath, Mardin, Newfound, Onteora, Ontusia, Shelburne, Simoda, Willowemoc, and Wellsboro series are similar soils in related families. Bath, Lackawanna, Mardin, and Wellsboro soils have a mesic temperature regime. Lewbeach and Lewbath soils lack redoximorphic features above the fragipan and have a semiactive cation exchange activity class. Newfound soils are superactive, have thinner sola and have sandy loam textures above the fragipan. Onteora and Ontusia soils have an aquic moisture regime. Shelburne soils are oxyaquic and have rock fragments dominated by schist and siliceous limestone. Simoda soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section. Willowemoc soils are semiactive and, have hues of 2.5YR or 5YR in the lower subsoil (fragipan) and the substratum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Willdin soils are on uplands of glaciated dissected plateaus and till plains and are mainly on slightly convex hilltops and hillsides. Slope is commonly from 0 to 25 percent but the range includes up to 35 percent. The soils developed in firm till derived from sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 9 degrees C (39 to 48 degrees F). Annual precipitation ranges from 825 to 1790 mm (32 to 70 in) and the frost free days range from 110 to 155 days. Elevation ranges from 425 to 1100 m (1394 to 3608 ft) above sea level."

Moderately deep, well drained Mongaup soils, and well drained, moderately deep or deep Cuyler (T) soils, and shallow, somewhat excessively drained and well drained Hawksnest soils are closely associated on nearby landforms where the soil mantle is thinner over bedrock. Valois soils are on adjacent sides of valleys where the till is less dense."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This series is the frigid equivalent of the Mardin series, and the brown colored equivalent of the Willowemoc series. Original classification of Willdin placed it in the subgroup Typic Fragiochrepts, but because of changes established in the 8th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy this soil now classifies in the subgroup of Typic Fragiudepts.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 18 cm (7 in) (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 18 to 43 cm (7 to 17 in) (Bw and E horizons).\n3. Fragipan - within the upper 100 cm of the mineral surface-the zone from 43 to 112 cm (17 to 44 in) (Bx1, Bx2, and Bx3 horizons).\n4. Udic soil moisture regime.\n5. CEC activity class of active based on the average CEC7/TC ratio for two pedons (S85NY077-03 & S86NY077-11)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Cornell University Soil Characterization Lab data is available for this pedon (S86NY077-11), and for another pedon from Otsego County, New York (S85NY077-03).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
