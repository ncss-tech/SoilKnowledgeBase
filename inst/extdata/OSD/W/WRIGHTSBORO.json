  "REVDATE": "12/2002",
  "STATES": "NC,VA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wrightsboro series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on broad interstream divides in the lower Coastal Plain.  These soils formed in loamy and clayey marine sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent and are dominantly less than 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 53 inches and mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F., near the type location.",

The clayey 2B horizon is at a depth of 40 to 80 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid, except where surface layers have been limed.  Limed soils typically have slightly acid or neutral surface layers.  Flakes of mica range from none to common in the B and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 4 to 6.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe BE or BA horizon, where present, has 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Mottles are in shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam.  Clay content averages 24 to 35 percent and silt content is less than 30 percent.\nThe Btg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 4 to 7.

Goldston and Whitwell soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity within 40 to 80 inches.  Altavista and Tetotum soils have mixed mineralogy.  Craven and Duplin soils have a clayey particle-size control section.  Foreston and Stallings soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section.  Kullit soils have hue of 5YR in part of the Bt horizon.  Johns soils have solum thickness less than 40 inches and have a fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal particle-size control section.  Kempsville soils do not have low chroma mottles in the upper subsoil.  Ogeechee soils have mottles with chroma of 2 or less throughout the upper subsoil.  Quitman soils have a Btx horizon, and in addition do not have a lithologic discontinuity and a clayey 2B horizon."
