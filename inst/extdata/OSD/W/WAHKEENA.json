  "OVERVIEW": "The Wahkeena series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from basalt. Wahkeena soils are on very steep smooth and dissected slopes in the Cascade Mountains and have slopes of 60 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 70 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

The soils formed in colluvium weathered from the Columbia River Basalt formation. The climate is humid. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 60 to 100 inches falling as rain in the autumn, winter, and spring. Winter snows are usually light and ephermeral. Rainfall amounts are relatively low in the summer. Drying east winds are frequent. The average January temperature is 35 degrees F. The average July temperature is 68 degrees F. The average annual temperature is 48 degrees to 54 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 200 days."
