  "OVERVIEW": "The Wideman series consists of very deep, excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in sandy alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains and natural levees along streams in the Ozark Highlands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches.",

The flood plains are often dissected by old channels, now inactive. Slopes are usually less than 3 percent but range from 0 to 5 percent. Wideman soils formed in sandy alluvium with thin strata of finer texture.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from about 42 to 48 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from about 54 to 58 degrees F."

Boden soils have more than 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon.  Moko soils are 6 to 20 inches to a lithic contact.  Boden and Moko soils are on steep, adjacent sideslopes.  Britwater soils are fine-loamy and are on higher terrace positions.  Brockett and Portia soils are fine-loamy and are on nearby footslope and gently sloping upland positions.  Brockwell soils are coarse-loamy and are on nearby gently sloping uplands.  Razort soils are fine-loamy and are on slightly higher elevations."
