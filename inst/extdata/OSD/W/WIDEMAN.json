Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand. Reaction is extremely acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, values of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4, or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The particle size control control section is dominantly loamy sand, sand, or fine sand and contains thin strata of loamy very fine sand or finer textures.  Coarse fragments, dominantly gravel, range from 0 to 85 percent in thin lenses in some C pedons. Reaction is stongly acid to neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wideman soils are on flood plains and natural levees along streams in the Ozark Highlands of Arkansas and Missouri. The flood plains are often dissected by old channels, now inactive. Slopes are usually less than 3 percent but range from 0 to 5 percent. Wideman soils formed in sandy alluvium with thin strata of finer texture.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from about 42 to 48 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from about 54 to 58 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Boden, Britwater, Brockett, Brockwell, Moko, Portia, and Razort series.  Boden soils have more than 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon.  Moko soils are 6 to 20 inches to a lithic contact.  Boden and Moko soils are on steep, adjacent sideslopes.  Britwater soils are fine-loamy and are on higher terrace positions.  Brockett and Portia soils are fine-loamy and are on nearby footslope and gently sloping upland positions.  Brockwell soils are coarse-loamy and are on nearby gently sloping uplands.  Razort soils are fine-loamy and are on slightly higher elevations."
