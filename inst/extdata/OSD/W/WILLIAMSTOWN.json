  "STATES": "IN,MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Williamstown series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are moderately deep to dense till. The soils formed in as much as 56 cm (22 inches) of loess and in the underlying loamy till. They are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
