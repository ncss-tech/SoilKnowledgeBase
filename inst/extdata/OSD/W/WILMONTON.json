  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 40 inches. These soils lack or have a loamy mantle that is less than 30 inches thick over glacial till. The upper sediment contains 0 to 5 percent coarse fragments by volume and the glacial till contains 2 to 8 percent. The coarse fragments are of mixed lithology. A stone line as much as 4 inches thick and containing as much as 15 percent coarse fragments is at the contact of the two sediments in some pedons. The mollic epipedon ranges from 14 to 24 inches in thickness. In some pedons, worm casts comprise as much as 40 percent of the volume of the lower A or upper B horizons. The particle-size control section averages between 24 and 33 percent clay and typically 10 to 30 percent fine sand and coarser and ranges from 15 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It typically is clay loam, silty clay loam or loam. Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nA BA horizon as thick as 8 inches is in some pedons.\nThe Bw horizon (when present) has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam, clay loam or silty clay loam. It is friable. It has a few dark concretions or stains (oxides) in the lower part in some pedons. Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bw horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam or clay loam and is typically firm. It has a few dark concretions or stains (oxides) in the lower part in some pedons. Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam or clay loam with or without coarser-textured wedges or seams. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline with 15 to 25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam or clay loam with or without coarser-textured wedges or seams. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline with 10 to 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. The moist bulk density ranges from 1.6 to 1.8 g/cc."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Arkton, Crippin, Floyd, Fostoria, Kensett, Merton, Nicollet, Ottosen, Readlyn and Snider soils in the same family. Arkton soils have carbonates above 20 inches. Crippin soils have carbonates beginning at depths of 10 inches or less. Floyd soils have thicker sola and coarser textured layers in the B horizons. Fostoria soils have loam sola and silt loam C horizons moderate permeability and friable consistence throughout. Kensett soils have hard limestone within depths of 40 inches. Merton and Readlyn soils have thicker and acid sola. Ottosen soils have friable B and C horizons and moderate permeability in the C horizon within depths of 40 inches below the surface. Nicollet soils typically are medium or slightly acid in the upper part of the B horizon and have friable C horizons. Snider soils formed in loamy alluvium on benches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wilmonton soils have slightly concave to slightly convex slopes on dissected ground moraines. Slopes are long and uniform with gradient of 0 to 3 percent and lengths of 150 to 400 feet. The Wilmonton soils typically formed in a thin layer of loess, ablation till or pedisediments and firm, clay loam or loam till. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 28 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 145 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 900 to 1,600 feet above sea level."

The moderately well drained Everly and well drained Storden soils commonly are downslope or on more sloping terrain. The poorly drained Letri soils are on nearby less sloping areas."
