  "OVERVIEW": "The Wichup series consists of deep, poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvial fan sediments derived from sandstone, quartzite, shale and small amounts of limestone.  These soils are on alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils have organic surface horizons 8 to 12 inches thick.  Much horizons are not always present but if present they range in thickness from 1 to 6 inches. The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 19 inches thick.  Typically, the soil is noncalcareous to depths in excess of 60 inches except that the 01 horizon may be weakly calcareous in places.  The 1O-to 40-inch control section is sandy loam or loam with 8 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 35 percent silt, and 50 to 80 percent sand, with more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.  Some stratification is common, particularly in the surface horizons but organic content decreases uniformly.  Rock fragments average 0 to 15 percent but thin horizons containing 15 to 35 percent pebbles and cobbles are in some pedons.  The soils have a water table above a depth of 40 inches during most of the year.\nThe Alg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 or less dry, 3 or less moist, and chroma of 2 or less.  It usually has distinct or prominent mottlings throughout or in some part.  This horizon has granular or crumb structure and is soft or slightly hard.  It is medium acid to mildly alkaline (pH 6.0 to 7.6).\nThe B2g horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of more than 5.5 dry or more than 3.5 moist, and chroma of not more than 2.  It has distinct or prominent mottles of both bright and dull chroma.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline (pH 7.0 to 7.8) and is usually nearly constant in reaction with increasing depth.\nA C horizon, when present, has higher chroma in some pedons."
