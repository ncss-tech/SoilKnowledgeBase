  "OVERVIEW": "The Wichup series consists of deep, poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvial fan sediments derived from sandstone, quartzite, shale and small amounts of limestone.  These soils are on alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
