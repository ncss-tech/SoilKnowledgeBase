  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Whiteye series consists of shallow to an indurated duripan, well drained soils that formed in a mixture of volcanic ash and loess over a indurated duripan.  They are on nonglaciated plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. These soils are usually dry in the moisture control section for more than half the cumulative time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. The mollic epipedon and depth to the argillic horizon is 7 to 10 inches thick. The upper 7 to 10 inches profile has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.35 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, including 10 to 20 percent sand-size pumice, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent, and an apparent field estimated clay content of 5 to 12 percent. The particle-size control section has 9 to 18 percent clay, 15 percent or more fine sand or coarser, 0 to 15 percent rock fragments including duripan fragments, and 0 to 30 percent volcanic glass including 0 to 10 percent sand-size pumice, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter. Depth to the indurated duripan is 10 to 20 inches. Basalt bedrock underlies the duripan at 20 to 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon chroma is 2 or 3 dry.\nThe 2Bt1 horizon value is 3 or 4 moist. The chroma is 3 or 4 dry or moist. The texture is silt loam or loam. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bt2 horizon value is 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist. The chroma is is 3 or 4 dry or moist. The texture is silt loam or loam. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 3Bkqm horizon has a value of 7 or 8 moist and a chroma of 1 or 2 moist. The duripan is cemented with silica and calcium carbonate and is fractured with average duripan plates measuring 4 to 14 inches in width and 1 to 4 inches in thickness."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Whiteye soils are on interfluves and side slopes on plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Whiteye soils formed in volcanic ash primarily from the G and B eruptions of Glacier Peak 12,750 to 11,250 years ago mixed with post-Wisconsin age loess over Wisconsin and pre-Wisconsin age loess over indurated duripan. Elevation is 1,900 to 2,800 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. Average January air temperature is about 27 degrees F., average July air temperature is about 71 degrees F., and average annual air temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. Frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."
