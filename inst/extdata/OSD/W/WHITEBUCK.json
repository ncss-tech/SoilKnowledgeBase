These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from metamorphosed volcanic rocks.  The mean annual precipitation is 23 to 25 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January.  The mean annual air temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 210 days."
