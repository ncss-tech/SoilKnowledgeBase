    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ferrogold (NV), Infantry (NM), Neso (NM), Orrubo (AZ), Paisano (TX), Philder (NM), Sutherland (AZ), Tencee (NM) and Woodvar (NV). Ferrogold soils are greater than 36 centimeters (14 inches) to a hardpan. Infantry soils have greater than 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Neso soils have significantly more summer moisture, typical of the Chihuahuan Desert region. Orrubo soils have paralithic contacts at depths ranging from 43 to 76 centimeters (17 to 30 inches). Paisano and Tencee soils have significantly more summer moisture, typical of the Chihuahuan Desert region. Philder soils have an ustic-aridic soil moisture regime. Sutherland soils have an ustic-aridic soil moisture regime. Woodvar soils have rock fragments composed mainly of limestone nodules and concretions and are on lake terraces and alluvial flats."
