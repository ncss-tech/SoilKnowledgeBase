  "OVERVIEW": "The Wakefield series consists of moderately well drained soils formed in modified loamy eolian deposits and in the underlying loamy glacial till on till plains.  Permeability is moderate above the fragipan, very slow in the fragipan, and moderate below the fragipan. Slopes range from 1 to 18 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
