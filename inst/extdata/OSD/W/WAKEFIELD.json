    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Argonne, and Wabeno series are being reclassified to coarse-loamy,mixed, frigid Alfic Oxyaquic Fragiorthods.  The Gogebic, Graveraet, Kallio, Munising, and Stuben(T) series need to be reclassified.  Argonne soils have hues yellower than 5YR in the lower solum and substratum and have less than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Gogebic and Munising soils contain more than 50 percent fine sand or coarser in the particle size control section. Graveraet soils contain free carbonates at depths from 20 to 60 inches.  Kallio soils contain more than 15 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the solum and contain more than 20 percent clay in the substratum.  Stuben soils average more than 85 percent sand in the series control section within depths of 20 to 40 inches. Wabeno soils have less than than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon and have hues yellower than 5YR in the lower part of the solum and substratum."
