  "OVERVIEW": "The Wasatch series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from metamorphic and igneous rocks.  Wasatch soils are on fan remnants and lake terraces.  Slopes are 3 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The soil moisture control section, is dry for 60 to 90 consecutive days in the summer months.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The particle-size control section has 0 to 15 percent rock fragments.  Clay content is 1 to 10 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 to 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The structure is weak, fine and medium granular.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.  Rock fragment content is 0 to 15 percent fine (2 to 5 millimeters) gravel.\nIn some pedons, the AC horizon has an increase in clay which coats the sand but is not sufficient for a textural Bt horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is stratified sand or loamy coarse sand.  This horizon is massive or single grain.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.  Rock fragment content is 0 to 15 percent."

Harpt soils are medium textured.  Knutson soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have cambic horizons.  Reywat soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section, have a Bt horizon and are less than 20 inches deep to bedrock."
