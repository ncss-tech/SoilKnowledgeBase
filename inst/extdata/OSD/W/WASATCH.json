  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F., and the average summer soil temperature is 70 to 74 degrees F. The soil moisture control section, is dry for 60 to 90 consecutive days in the summer months.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The particle-size control section has 0 to 15 percent rock fragments.  Clay content is 1 to 10 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 to 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The structure is weak, fine and medium granular.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.  Rock fragment content is 0 to 15 percent fine (2 to 5 millimeters) gravel.\nIn some pedons, the AC horizon has an increase in clay which coats the sand but is not sufficient for a textural Bt horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is stratified sand or loamy coarse sand.  This horizon is massive or single grain.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.  Rock fragment content is 0 to 15 percent."

La Posta soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Layton soils have horizons with accumulation of secondary carbonates."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wasatch soils are on fan remnants and lake terraces.  They formed in alluvium derived from metamorphic and igneous rocks.  Slopes are 3 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 2,000 to 5,300 feet.  The climate is subhumid continental.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches mostly falling in the fall, winter, and early spring.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F., the average summer temperature is 69 to 75 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 140 to 180 days."

Cashmere, Kilburn and Payette soils are moderately coarse textured.  Also Payette soils have weak Bt horizons.  Draper soils are medium textured and are somewhat poorly drained.  Harpt soils are medium textured.  Knutson soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have cambic horizons.  Reywat soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section, have a Bt horizon and are less than 20 inches deep to bedrock."
