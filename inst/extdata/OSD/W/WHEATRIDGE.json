  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to uniformly calcareous material normally ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  Depth to the contrasting IIC horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 17 to 35 inches. Subhorizons redder than 7.5YR are in some pedons but a major part of the solum above the IIC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or yellower. Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and any C horizon above the IIC horizon and these are mainly 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  Subhorizons redder than 7.5YR are in some pedons.  This horizon is typically gravelly loam or clay loam but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 20 to 55 percent, and sand from 20 to 50 percent with less than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye)."

Altvan and Atencio soils are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon. Atencio and Redridge soils have hue of 5YR or redder in a majority of subhorizons above the IIC horizon.  Bresser, Eckley, Newlin, and Kedridge soils have argillic horizons with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Also, Eckley soils have contrasting horizons at depths of less than 20 inches.  Tuthill soils have less than 35 percent gravel in the IIC horizon above a depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wheatridge soils are on nearly level to gently sloping terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes typically range from about O to 6 percent or more. The soils formed in moderately thin, noncalcareous, medium or moderately fine textured alluvium overlying beds of gravelly or very gravelly loamy sand or sand. In some places the alluvium has a minor influence from granite or arkose deposits but not to the degree that is considered differentiating. At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 69 degrees F."

Larimer soils have an ochric epipedon, are calcareous above a depth of 40 inches, and have continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation.  Sampson soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick, and lack sandy-skeletal substratums."
