  "OVERVIEW": "The Wellsboro series consists of very deep moderately well and somewhat poorly drained soils formed in till derived from red sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the mineral surface layer, subsurface layer, and upper part of the subsoil; and low or moderately low in the lower part of the subsoil (fragipan) and the substratum. Mean annual precipitation is 1080 mm (42.5 in). Mean annual temperature is 8 degrees C (46 degrees F).",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is greater than 102 cm (40 in). Depth to the fragipan ranges from 36 to 76 cm (14 to 30 in). Depth to bedrock is 152 cm (60 in) or more. Rock fragments of subangular and rounded sandstone, siltstone or shale range from 5 to 40 percent in the A and B horizons, and from 15 to 50 percent in the Bx and C horizons. Typically rock fragments average about 5 to 25 percent by volume above the fragipan and 15 to 40 percent by volume in and below the fragipan. The control section has less than 35 percent rock fragments by volume. Reaction commonly ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid unless limed but the range includes extremely acid.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma 2 or 3. Dry color value is 6 or more. Texture is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nPedons in wooded areas have an A horizon with hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. These pedons also may have an E horizon with hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nA B/E horizon may also be present in some pedons. Colors and textures of the B part of the B/E are similar to those of the Bw horizon. The E part of the B/E has color and texture similar to the E horizon.\nThe Bw horizon above 51 cm (20 in) has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 through 6. The lower part of the Bw horizon includes subhorizons with chroma of 2. The Bw horizon has both high and low chroma redoximorphic features. Texture is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon above the fragipan. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bx horizon has chroma of 10R through 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Faces of prisms range in hue from 10R through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure of the Bx horizon is weak or moderate, coarse or very coarse prismatic. Prisms have platy, blocky, or massive interiors.\nThe C or Cd horizon is similar in color and texture to the Bx horizon."

The Bath, Broadalbin, and Mardin soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the fragipan. Braceville soils have stratified sand and gravel within the series control section. Ira, Sodus, Swartswood and Wurtsboro commonly have less than 55 percent silt plus very fine sand in the particle size control section. Lackawanna soils do not have redoximorphic features above the fragipan. Rushford soils have a silty lacustrine substratum with few or no rock fragments."

The soils developed in firm till derived from reddish sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Mean annual temperature ranges from 6 to 11 degrees C (43 to 52 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 795 to 1725 mm (31 to 68 in), and mean annual frost-free season ranges from 105 to 180 days. These soils generally occur at elevations between 100 and 670 m (328 and 2,198 ft), but have been mapped as high as 750 m (2,460 ft) in some areas."

Arnot, Lordstown, Maplecrest, and Oquaga soils are nearby. Arnot soils are shallow to bedrock; Lordstown and Oquaga soils are moderately deep. Maplecrest soils are well drained and lack a fragipan."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Three soil survey areas in Pennsylvania (Bradford-Sullivan, Columbia, and Wayne Counties) mapped Wellsboro as moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained. All three of these survey areas also had Morris (somewhat poorly drained) in their legend as well. The Taxonomic Unit Descriptions for these three survey areas look moderately well drained. Further investigation is needed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 20 cm (8 in) (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 20 to 61 cm (8 to 24 in) (Bw horizon).\n3. Fragipan - the zone from 61 to 122 cm (24 to 48 in) (Bx horizon).\n4. Udic soil moisture regime (a humid, temperate climate).\nSoil Interpretation Records: PA0027, PA0028, PA0227\nThe activity class is based on pedon S86NY025-5 from Delaware County, NY."
