  "REVDATE": "04/2014",
  "STATES": "MT,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Windham series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in very gravelly alluvium and colluvium derived mainly from limestone. These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, stream terraces, structural benches, escarpments, ridges, divides, hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 85 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
