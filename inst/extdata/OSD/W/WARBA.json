  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to carbonates ranges from 35 and 70 inches. The till has 2 to 12 percent by volume of rock fragments of mixed lithology, but typically high in gray, extremely hard, flat shale. Most pedons have a few cobblestones throughout the soil. The soil moisture control section is not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days in most years. Many pedons have a mantle with a high content of coarse silt and very fine sand. It is as much as 20 inches thick. It has 0 to 5 percent by volume of rock fragments.\nThe O horizons have hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is Oa, Oe or Oi. It is comprised of accumulated forest litter of deciduous tree leaves, coniferous tree needles and remains of forest floor flora.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. The E horizon has value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or value of 6 and chroma of 3. The A and E horizons are very fine sandy loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam or loam. They are strongly acid to slightly acid. Some pedons have an Ap horizon with dry value of 5 or higher.\nThe glossic horizon consists of an E/B or B/E or both. The E and Bt material each occupy 15 percent or more of the horizon. Colors and textures are similar to E and Bt horizons respectively.\nThe Bt horizon has matrix hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and a typical chroma of 3 or 4. Some pedons have a minor amount of chroma of 2 beginning 10 inches or more below the upper boundary of the Bt horizon. It is clay loam, loam or sandy clay loam having 20 to 35 percent of clay. It typically has 30 to 40 percent of fine sand and coarser sand. It averages less than 45 percent sand. It commonly is moderately acid to neutral but may be strongly acid in the upper part. It has manganese oxide nodules in the lower part in some pedons. Some pedons have a Bk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Most pedons have high chroma Fe concentrations. It is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam. It is neutral to moderately alkaline. Below the upper few inches it has calcium carbonate equivalent in the range of about 5 to 15 percent."

The Cushing soils average less than 25 percent clay and greater than 45 percent total sand in the Bt and C horizon. The Bamfield and Duluth soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder in the middle and lower third of the series control section. Lozeau soils have a paralithic contact above a depth of 40 inches. The Sol soils have less than 18 percent clay in the lower one-third of the series control section and have more than 45 percent sand in the argillic horizon and below."

They formed in calcareous loamy till in the late Wisconsinan glaciation. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 42 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 28 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 88 to 135 days. Elevation ranges from 1,000 to 1,600 feet above sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Stuntz soils are less sloping with slightly concave slopes and the very poorly drained Talmoon soils are in shallow depressions. Cathro, Greenwood, Lupton, Mooselake, and Seelyeville are organic soils in adjacent depressions."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the mineral soil surface to 15 inches (A, E1, E2, E/B horizons); albic horizons - the zones from 1 to 15 inches (E1, E2, and E/B horizons); glossic horizon - the zone from 6 to 15 inches (E/B and B/E horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from 15 to 37 inches (B/E, Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons); Base saturation above 60 percent in all parts of argillic horizon.\nThe moderately wet phase needs field study to determine if it does or does not qualify as an Oxyaquic subgroup of Glossudalfs.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to MAES Central File Code No. 879 for results of some laboratory analyses of the typifying pedon and to Nos. 733 and 796 for data on two other pedons. Soil Interpretation Record numbers are MN0140 and MN0708, moderate wet phase.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
