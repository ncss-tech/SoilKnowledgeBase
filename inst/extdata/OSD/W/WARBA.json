The till has 2 to 12 percent by volume of rock fragments of mixed lithology, but typically high in gray, extremely hard, flat shale. Most pedons have a few cobblestones throughout the soil. The soil moisture control section is not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days in most years. Many pedons have a mantle with a high content of coarse silt and very fine sand. It is as much as 20 inches thick. It has 0 to 5 percent by volume of rock fragments.\nThe O horizons have hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is Oa, Oe or Oi. It is comprised of accumulated forest litter of deciduous tree leaves, coniferous tree needles and remains of forest floor flora.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. The E horizon has value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or value of 6 and chroma of 3. The A and E horizons are very fine sandy loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam or loam. They are strongly acid to slightly acid. Some pedons have an Ap horizon with dry value of 5 or higher.\nThe glossic horizon consists of an E/B or B/E or both. The E and Bt material each occupy 15 percent or more of the horizon. Colors and textures are similar to E and Bt horizons respectively.\nThe Bt horizon has matrix hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and a typical chroma of 3 or 4. Some pedons have a minor amount of chroma of 2 beginning 10 inches or more below the upper boundary of the Bt horizon. It is clay loam, loam or sandy clay loam having 20 to 35 percent of clay. It typically has 30 to 40 percent of fine sand and coarser sand. It averages less than 45 percent sand. It commonly is moderately acid to neutral but may be strongly acid in the upper part. It has manganese oxide nodules in the lower part in some pedons. Some pedons have a Bk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Most pedons have high chroma Fe concentrations. It is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam. It is neutral to moderately alkaline. Below the upper few inches it has calcium carbonate equivalent in the range of about 5 to 15 percent."
