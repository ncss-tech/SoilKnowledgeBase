  "OVERVIEW": "The Watsondraw series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or slope alluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  These soils are on fan remnants and hills.  Slopes are 3 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 560 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 1.0 degrees C.",
