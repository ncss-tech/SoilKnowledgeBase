  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to soft bedrock ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  The soil contains as much as 5 percent coarse fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is loam but some is silt loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, very fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  It typically does not have carbonates except where mixed by tillage.\nThe ABk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, 3 or 4 moist; and chroma of  2 to 4.  It is very fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, or clay loam and contains 1 to 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Some of the carbonates are in soft masses on the faces of peds and around pores.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.\nThe Cr horizon is soft massive or platy fine grained sandstone or interbedded sandstone, siltstone, and shale."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the family.  Other competing series are the Abac, Barvon, Cabba, Cohagen, Kloten, and Wayden series.  Abac, Cabba, Cohagen, and Wayden soils do not have mollic epipedons.  In addition, Cohagen soils are coarse-loamy.  The Barvon soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Wayden soils are clayey.  Kloten soils have a lithic contact within 20 inches of the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Werner soils are on gently sloping to very steep convex ridge crests and side slopes of upland plains and sides of valleys.  Slope gradients range from 3 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in residuum weathered from soft sandstone and shale.  The climate is cool, semiarid.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 14 to 17 inches.  Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer."

Cabba, Cohagen, and Wayden soils are on similar landscapes as Werner.  Amor, Morton, Sen, and Vebar soils are on smoother and typically less sloping parts of the landscape.  Max, Williams, and Zahl soils are on nearby glaciated plains.  All of the noncompeting soils are deeper."
