Depth to the fragipan ranges from 20 to 36 inches and depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe B2 horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry, and has common to many, fine to medium, distinct and prominent mottles.  It has chroma of 2 on faces of peds and has high chroma mottles at depths of less than 20 inches.  Chroma of 3 is in some parts between depths of 6 and 20 inches.  The B2 horizon is silt loam or loam with 12 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It has thin to thick gray silt and sand coatings on faces of peds.  This horizon is silt loam and has 15 to 22 percent clay.  It has weak or moderate subangular blocky or coarser or very coarse prismatic structure and is firm or very firm and brittle.  Mottling ranges from faint to prominent.\nThe Cx horizon has similar ranges except it is massive or has weak very coarse prismatic structure."
