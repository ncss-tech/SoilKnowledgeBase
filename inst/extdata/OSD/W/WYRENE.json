  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to loamy sand or coarser textures ranges from 20 to 32 inches.  Typically, the A and Bk horizons average between 6 and 18 percent clay and 18 to 35 percent silt.  They contain up to 10 percent rock fragments.  The particle-size control section contains more than 30 percent medium and coarser sand.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1.  It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have an AK horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It contains 15 to more than 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Some pedons have a 2Bk horizon.  It has textures similar to the 2C horizon, however, it may also have a texture of loamy sand.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 6.  It is sand or coarse, or their gravelly analogues, containing up to 35 percent rock fragments.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It has few to many, and faint to prominent redox features in some pedons.  Glacial till or lacustrine sediments with textures of loam, clay loam or silt loam are below depths of 40 inches in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wyrene soils are on level and nearly level slightly depressed areas on outwash plains and interbeach areas.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in moderately coarse overlying coarse textured sediments.  The climate is cool, subhumid.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 15 to 22 inches.  Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer.  Frost-free period ranges from 110 to 140 days.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 900 to 2300 feet."

Arveson, Marysland, Syrene and Totten soils are on nearby slightly lower lying areas.  Arveson soils are coarse-loamy.  Marysland soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal.  Totten soils have natric horizons.  Arvilla, Claire, Lohnes, Osakis, Sandberg and Warsing soils are on higher lying areas and are moderately well drained to excessively drained.  Divide, Hamar and Wyndmere soils are on nearby outwash plains.  Divide soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal. Hamar and Hangaard soils do not have calcic horizons.  Wyndmere soils are coarse-loamy."
