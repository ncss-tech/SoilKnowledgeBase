  "OVERVIEW": "The Wadams series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice over coarse ablation till.  These soils are on glaciated foothills and low mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The mean precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees.",
