    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bassel (CO), Burgess (WY), Ethelman (CO), Greenman (WY), Opitz (MT), Spinney (CO), and Tiagos (CO) series. Bassel soils have high amounts of medium and coarse angular sand and fine granite pebbles, and have horizons with continuous accumulations of secondary calcium carbonates within 40 inches of the surface. Spinney soils have non-contrasting sandy-skeletal substrata above a depth of 40 inches. In addition, Spinney contains carbonates within 40 inches. Burgess, Ethelman, and Greenman soils have bedrock within 40 inches. Opitz soils are moderately deep to grus and deep to hard bedrock. Tiagos soils have mean summer soil temperatures of 48 to 58 degrees F, are neutral or mildly alkaline, and receive less total precipitation."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Washpass soils are on north-facing footslopes and backslopes of hills, buttes, and escarpments. They formed in colluvium derived from Tertiary basalt and tuff-breccia. Slopes are 25 to 70 percent. Elevation ranges from 8,200 to 9,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 24 inches with more than 50 percent falling as snow from winter storms. The mean annual temperature is 39 to 41 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."

Owlspring soils are fine-silty, somewhat poorly drained, and occur on toeslopes. Todacheene soils are fine-loamy, have thick mollic epipedons, and occur on footslopes and fan terraces. Viewpoint soils are shallow to basalt, and occur on adjacent shoulders. Sonsela soils are loamy-skeletal, lack mollic epipedons, and occur on adjacent south-facing backslopes."

(Bt/E1, Bt/E2, Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons)\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Organic carbon content determined by Inter-Mountain Laboratories, Inc.  A soil similar to Washpass was sampled for the NSSL in 1986 in the Fort Defiance soil survey area. It was given the name Washpass and sampled as pedon # S86-NM-045-004. The taxonomic classification of that soil is different from this current proposal.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
