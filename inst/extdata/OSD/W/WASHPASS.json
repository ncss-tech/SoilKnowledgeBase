  "OVERVIEW": "The Washpass series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from basalt and tuff-breccia. Washpass soils are on north-facing footslopes and backslopes of hills, buttes, and escarpments. Permeability is moderately rapid. Slopes are 25 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and mean annual temperature is 40 degrees F.",

Bassel soils have high amounts of medium and coarse angular sand and fine granite pebbles, and have horizons with continuous accumulations of secondary calcium carbonates within 40 inches of the surface. Spinney soils have non-contrasting sandy-skeletal substrata above a depth of 40 inches. In addition, Spinney contains carbonates within 40 inches. Burgess, Ethelman, and Greenman soils have bedrock within 40 inches. Opitz soils are moderately deep to grus and deep to hard bedrock. Tiagos soils have mean summer soil temperatures of 48 to 58 degrees F, are neutral or mildly alkaline, and receive less total precipitation."
