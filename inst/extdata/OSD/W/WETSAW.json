  "OVERVIEW": "The Wetsaw series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and gravelly alluvium over clayey residuum of shale of Mississippian age. These soils are on benches and stream terraces in valleys of the Ouachita Mountains. Water runs off the surface at a medium rate. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.",

Mean annual temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 40 to 60 inches. Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 64 to\n80."

Avilla soils are on terraces in and adjacent to the Quachita Mountains, are well drained and moderately permeable. Bengal, Carnasaw, and Tuskahoma soils are on steeper parts of the adjacent uplands and have a clayey control section. Bengal soils have a solum 20 to 40 inches thick, Carnasaw soils have solum thickness of 40 to 60 inches, and Tuskahoma soils have a solum thickness less than 20 inches. Kenn soils are on flood plains and have a gravelly 2BC and 2C horizon. Mena soils formed in pedisediments and old alluvium and are in a fine textural family. Neff and Speer series are on flood plains or low terraces in lower positions. Neff soils have a fine-silty control section. Speer soils lack gray mottles in the Bt2 horizon."
