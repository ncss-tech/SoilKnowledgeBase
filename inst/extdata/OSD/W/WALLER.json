    "content": "REMARKS:  Based on Lincoln Soil Survey Laboratory Data of closely associated soils, the mineralogy class was changed from mixed to siliceous. See Dr. Grossman's memo dated September 14, 1972, SOILS - Harris County, Texas, in reference to the Hockley and Wockley series. Study and Thesis by M. Vepraskas (TAMU) shows E horizon is slowly permeable. The Lelavale series was established in 1998 in Hardin County, Texas to separate the very poorly drained Waller, depressional unit from the Waller series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features for this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 86 cm (0 to 34 in) (A and Eg horizon)\nArgillic horizon: 86 to 203 cm (34 to 80 in) (Btg/Eg horizon)\nGlossic horizon: 86 to 203 cm (34 to 80 in) (Btg/Eg horizon)\nAquic moisture regime: these soils have aquic conditions from December to April in normal years.\nADDITIONAL DATA: TAMU Data from the Tyler County, Texas taxonomic unit location on pedon S00TX-457-004.
