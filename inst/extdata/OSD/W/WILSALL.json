  "REVDATE": "01/2014",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wilsall series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from interbedded sandstone and shale.  These soils are on hills, escarpments and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
