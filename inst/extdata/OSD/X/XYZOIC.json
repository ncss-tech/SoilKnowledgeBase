  "OVERVIEW": "The Xyzoic series consists of very shallow and shallow to a paralithic contact, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from granite. Xyzoic soils are on mountains and have slopes of 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
