Some areas are formed in mixed rocks that include metamorphic and basic intrusive rocks.  Elevations are 2,600 to 5,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 44 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is about 81 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 56 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 175 to 225 days."
