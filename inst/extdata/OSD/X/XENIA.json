  "OVERVIEW": "The Xenia series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are deep or very deep to dense till. Xenia soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy till on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
