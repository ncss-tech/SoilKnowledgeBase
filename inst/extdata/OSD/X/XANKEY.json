  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Xankey series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from sandstone and basalt. Xankey soils are on backslopes below mesas and stable landslides and have moderate permeability. Slopes are 25 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F.",

Ymark soils are deep. Macmeal, Trapps, and Yourame soils have accumulations of calcium carbonate. Colomex soils formed in stratified alluvium and have an abrupt change to sandy textures within 40 inches. Laventana soils have albic horizons. Mocmont soils have glossic horizons. Namon soils are deep to a lithic contact of sandstone. Sheek soils have moderately slow permeability. Skyview and Wahatoya soils are moderately deep. Sonsela soils are more moist and lack loamy substrata within 40 inches. Tecolote soils have an albic horizon. Towaoc soils have more than 18 percent clay. Vision soils formed in mixed igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary parent material. Yreka soils have mixed E/Bt horizons. In addition, Macmeal, Mocmont, Skyview, Trapps, Vision, Wahatoya, Ymark, Yourame, and Yreka soils are moist in May and June."
