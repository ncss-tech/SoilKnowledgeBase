Ymark soils are deep. Macmeal, Trapps, and Yourame soils have accumulations of calcium carbonate. Colomex soils formed in stratified alluvium and have an abrupt change to sandy textures within 40 inches. Laventana soils have albic horizons. Mocmont soils have glossic horizons. Namon soils are deep to a lithic contact of sandstone. Sheek soils have moderately slow permeability. Skyview and Wahatoya soils are moderately deep. Sonsela soils are more moist and lack loamy substrata within 40 inches. Tecolote soils have an albic horizon. Towaoc soils have more than 18 percent clay. Vision soils formed in mixed igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary parent material. Yreka soils have mixed E/Bt horizons. In addition, Macmeal, Mocmont, Skyview, Trapps, Vision, Wahatoya, Ymark, Yourame, and Yreka soils are moist in May and June."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Xankey soils are on backslopes below mesas and stable landslides. They formed in colluvium derived from Tertiary sandstone and basalt. Slopes are 25 to 70 percent. Elevation ranges from 7,500 to 8,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches with more than 50 percent falling as snow from winter storms.  The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."
