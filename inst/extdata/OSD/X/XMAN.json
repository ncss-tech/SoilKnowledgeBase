  "OVERVIEW": "The Xman series consist of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from volcanic rock.  Xman soils are on plateaus, hills and mountains. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
