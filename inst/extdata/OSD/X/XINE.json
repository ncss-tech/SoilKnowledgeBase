Denay soils are very deep and have cambic horizons overlying the calcic horizon. Nirac soils have a lithic contact at 50 to 100 cm and dominantly gravel in the particle-size control section. Pamison soils are very deep, contain mottles and have silica cementation. Rudeen soils have underlying material with less carbonate than the calcic horizon and has a lithic contact to tuff or rhyolite bedrock between 50 and 100 cm. Wereld soils are 100 to 150 cm deep to a lithic contact."
