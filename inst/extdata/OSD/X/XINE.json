  "OVERVIEW": "The Xine series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone, dolomite and calcareous shale. The Xine soils are on mountain side slopes. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

Pamison soils are very deep, contain mottles and have silica cementation. Rudeen soils have underlying material with less carbonate than the calcic horizon and has a lithic contact to tuff or rhyolite bedrock between 50 and 100 cm. Wereld soils are 100 to 150 cm deep to a lithic contact."
