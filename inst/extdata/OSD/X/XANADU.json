The soil is usually moist and is dry between 4 and 12 inches for less than 45 consecutive days during the summer.  The argillic horizon is clay or clay loam and averages 35 to 55 percent clay with an apparent field texture of silt loam.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 to 5 dry, chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 to 5 dry.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent gravel.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and 4 to 8 dry.  It is clay or clay loam averaging 40 to 60 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe BAt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Xanadu soils are on benches, broad ridgetops and mountain side slopes.   Elevations are 200 to 2,500 feet.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from siltstone and sandstone. Slopes range form 3 to 60 percent.  The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, moist summers.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 55 to 90 inches.  The frost-free season is 145 to 240 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bohannon, Digger, Honeygrove, McDuff, Orford, and Preacher soils.  Bohannon and Preacher soils are fine-loamy and do not have argillic horizons. McDuff soils are moderately deep to weathered siltstone and sandstone. Digger soils are in the loamy-skeletal family.  Honeygrove and Orford soils have mixed mineralogy."
