  "OVERVIEW": "The Xanadu series consists of very deep, well drained soils on broad ridges, benches and mountain side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from siltstone and sandstone.  Slopes are 3 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 75 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The argillic horizon is clay or clay loam and averages 35 to 55 percent clay with an apparent field texture of silt loam.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 to 5 dry, chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 to 5 dry.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent gravel.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and 4 to 8 dry.  It is clay or clay loam averaging 40 to 60 percent clay.
