  "OVERVIEW": "The Xema series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in eolian or alluvial deposits and residuum derived primarily from sandstone.  Xema soils are on plateaus, ridges and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
