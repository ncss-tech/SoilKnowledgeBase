  "OVERVIEW": "The Xeto series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  Xeto soils are on hills and paleoterrace risers.  Slopes range from 12 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.9 degrees C.",
