  "REVDATE": "04/2019",
  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Xeribrush series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits. These soils are on fan remnants, dipslopes, strike valleys, escarpments, scarp slopes and landslides. Slopes are 3 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 8.3 degrees C.",
