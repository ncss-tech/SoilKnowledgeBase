  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  Similar soils in other families are the Fernow and Goffpeak series.  Fernow soils are sandy loam and loam in the upper part and have a spodic horizon formed above the cindery underlying material.  Goffpeak soils have a xeric soil moisture regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Xana soils are on mountain slopes and ridgetops on the west flanks of Mount St. Helens at elevations of 2,800 to 4,200 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in layers of aerially deposited dacitic pumice and volcanic ash.  Beginning at the surface of the mineral soil, the stratigraphy of pyroclastic material from Mount St. Helens present in Xana profiles is (1) ash and pumice of the 176 year old \"layer I\", (2) ash and pumice of the pyroclastic flow ash clouds of the 350 year old Kalama eruptive period and the 400 year old \"layer W\", and (3) pumice of the 3,200 year old \"layer Y\".  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 120 to 130 inches which includes considerable snowfall.  Average annual air temperature is 37 to 40 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 110 to 125 days."
