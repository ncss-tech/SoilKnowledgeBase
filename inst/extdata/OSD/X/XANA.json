These soils formed in layers of aerially deposited dacitic pumice and volcanic ash.  Beginning at the surface of the mineral soil, the stratigraphy of pyroclastic material from Mount St. Helens present in Xana profiles is (1) ash and pumice of the 176 year old \"layer I\", (2) ash and pumice of the pyroclastic flow ash clouds of the 350 year old Kalama eruptive period and the 400 year old \"layer W\", and (3) pumice of the 3,200 year old \"layer Y\".  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 120 to 130 inches which includes considerable snowfall.  Average annual air temperature is 37 to 40 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 110 to 125 days."
