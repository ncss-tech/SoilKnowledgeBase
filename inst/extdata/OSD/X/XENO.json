  "OVERVIEW": "The Xeno series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from highly weathered tuff and tuffaceous breccia with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  They are on benches, mountainsides and broad ridgetops.  Slopes are 5 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
