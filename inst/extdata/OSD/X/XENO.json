  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Xeno soils are on benches, mountainsides and broad ridgetops at elevations of 1,800 to 2,800 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 90 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from highly weathered tuff and tuffaceous breccia of Eocene age, with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  The climate is marine and is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 100 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 140 to 190 days."
