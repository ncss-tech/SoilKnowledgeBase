    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Xenmack soils are on risers of strath terrace remnants.  They formed in colluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum derived from Tertiary micaceous sandstone and siltstone.  Slopes are 25 to 60 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 6,600 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."

Depolvo soils are fine-silty, have argillic horizons, and occur on treads of strath terrace remnants.  Jaconita soils are sandy-skeletal, very deep to bedrock, and occur on adjacent risers.  Koshare soils are very deep, have cambic horizons, and occur on toeslopes of ridges and hills.  Sueleros soils are very deep, have natric horizons, and occur on treads of strath terrace remnants."
