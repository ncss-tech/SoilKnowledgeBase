  "OVERVIEW": "The Xenmack series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to interbedded sandstone and siltstone bedrock.  Xenmack soils formed in colluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum derived from micaceous sandstone and siltstone.  Xenmack soils are on risers of strath terrace remnants.  Slopes are 25 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
