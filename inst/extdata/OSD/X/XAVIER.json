  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F.  Thickness of solum ranges from 8 to 12 inches, and depth to bottom of B2t horizon ranges from 6 to 10 inches.  Hue is 10YR or 2.5Y throughout the soil.  The 10- to 40-inch section contains 20 to 35 percent clay.  There are few fine pebbles on the surface or at any depth, in some pedons.  The A1 horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  The Ap horizon has 22 to 30 percent clay.  The B2t horizon, 4 to 6 inches thick, has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 2 moist and chroma of 3 or 4.  It has 35 to 45 percent clay and cation exchange capacity of 70 to 80 millequivalents per 100 grams of clay.  This horizon has moderate to strong prismatic structure that separates to fine and medium blocky structure.  It is heavy silt loam to light silty clay loam.  This horizon has moderate to weak prismatic or blocky structure in the upper part.  This horizon contains common fine threads, seams and soft masses of lime."

Beauvais, and Keiser soils have mean annual soil temperature ranging from 48 to 53 degrees F. and they are usually dry.  Also, Keiser soils have ochric epipedons.  Farland, Jekley and Morton soils have silty clay loam B2t horizons with less than 35 percent clay and extending to depths greater than 10 inches.  Also, Morton soils have shale or siltstone bedrock at depths ranging from 20 to 40 inches.  Savage soils have silty clay B2t horizons with their base at depths ranging from 11 to 18 inches."
