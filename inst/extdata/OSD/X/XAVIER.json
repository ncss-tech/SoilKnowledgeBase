Thickness of solum ranges from 8 to 12 inches, and depth to bottom of B2t horizon ranges from 6 to 10 inches.  Hue is 10YR or 2.5Y throughout the soil.  The 10- to 40-inch section contains 20 to 35 percent clay.  There are few fine pebbles on the surface or at any depth, in some pedons.  The A1 horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  The Ap horizon has 22 to 30 percent clay.  The B2t horizon, 4 to 6 inches thick, has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 2 moist and chroma of 3 or 4.  It has 35 to 45 percent clay and cation exchange capacity of 70 to 80 millequivalents per 100 grams of clay.  This horizon has moderate to strong prismatic structure that separates to fine and medium blocky structure.  It is heavy silt loam to light silty clay loam.  This horizon has moderate to weak prismatic or blocky structure in the upper part.  This horizon contains common fine threads, seams and soft masses of lime."
