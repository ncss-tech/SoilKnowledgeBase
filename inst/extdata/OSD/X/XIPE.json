  "OVERVIEW": "The Xipe series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with some influence from loess and volcanic ash.  The Xipe soils are on stream and river flood plains and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
