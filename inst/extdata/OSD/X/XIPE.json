These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with some influence from loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 1,345 to 1,680 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
