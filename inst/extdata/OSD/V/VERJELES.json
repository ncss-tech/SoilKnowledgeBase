  "OVERVIEW": "The Verjeles series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in material weathered from intrusive basic igneous rocks, mainly gabbrodiorite. Verjeles soils are on hills and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 760 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C.",
