  "OVERVIEW": "The Ventris series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils with very slow permeability.  They formed in residual material weathered from dolomite, limestone, or calcareous shales.  These soils are on uplands in the Ozark Highland.  Slopes range from 3 to 40 percent.",

Captina soils have a fine-silty control section, a fragipan, and are adjacent similar landscapes.  Doniphan soils are deeper than 10 centimeters to bedrock, have redder B horizons, low base saturation in the lower solum and on similar landscapes.  Gassville soils have redder B horizons, low base saturation in the lower solum and mostly on steeper side slopes.  Moko soils are shallow to bedrock, have a loamy-skeletal control section, and on similar landscapes."

These soils were mapped under the field name of Colbert.  Change in classification based on University of Arkansas Soils Laboratory Data from Baxter County, Benton County, and Lawrence County, Arkansas."
