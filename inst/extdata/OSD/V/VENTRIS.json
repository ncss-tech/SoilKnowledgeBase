The A2 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2, 3, or 4.  The A horizon is silt loam, silty clay loam or with cherty, very cherty or stony\ntextural modifiers.  The reaction ranges from medium acid to\nneutral.\nThe B21t horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5, and chroma\nof 4 or 6, or value of 4, and chroma of 4.  The reaction ranges\nfrom medium acid to neutral.  Mottles are in shades of gray,\nbrown, or red.  The B22t horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5, and chroma of 4 or 6 and mottled with hue of 10YR,\nvalue of 4, 6, or 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is mottled in shades\nof gray, brown, and red with no dominant color.  The reaction\nranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  The B3 horizon,\nwhere present, has similar color and texture as the B22t horizon.  The B horizon is clay or cherty clay with 0 to 20 percent\nfragments of chert, limestone, or shale.\nThe Cr horizon is highly fractured weathered dolomite, limestone,\nor shale of light gray to yellowish brown colors.\nThe underlying bedrock (R) is hard level bedded dolomite limetone\nor shale."

Cadeville, Invershiel, Orange, and Wister soils have less than 60 percent\nclay in the control section and are thermic.  Homa soils are\nsimilar in texture but are thermic.  Marion soils have less than\n60 percent clay in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in residual\nmaterial weathered from dolomite, limestones, and calcareous\nshales of the Ozarks Highlands."

Arkana soils\nhave thicker mollic surface layers, dominant B horizon colors of\n5YR and on similar landscapes and steeper side slopes.  Captina\nsoils have a fine-silty control section, a fragipan, and are\nadjacent similar landscapes.  Doniphan soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock, have redder B horizons, low base saturation in\nthe lower solum and on similar landscapes.  Gassville soils have redder B horizons, low base saturation in the lower solum and\nmostly on steeper side slopes.  Moko soils are shallow to bedrock, have a loamy-skeletal control section, and on similar landscapes."
