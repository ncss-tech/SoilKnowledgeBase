Zion, Pevely, Rainsville, Rawson, Richland, Shawtown, and Summitville series. All of these soils except Cazenovia and Summitville series have hue yellower than 5YR in the upper part of the series control section. Cazenovia soils formed entirely in till and do not have a densic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Summitville soils formed in colluvium and residuum and have rock fragments of shale or siltstone lithology."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Vaughnsville soils are on beach ridges on lake plains of late Wisconsin age. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Vaughnsville soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loamy glaciolacustrine material and in the underlying fine or moderately fine textured till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 914 mm (27 to 36 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 165 days. Elevation is 183 to 244 meters (600 to 800 feet) above mean sea level."

The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 61 to 107 cm (2 to 3.5 feet) between January and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is very low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or moderately low in the solum, and low in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the loamy material, slow or moderately slow in the lower part of the solum, and slow or very slow in the substratum."
