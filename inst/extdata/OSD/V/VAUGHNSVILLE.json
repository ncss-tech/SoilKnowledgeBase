  "STATES": "OH",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Vaughnsville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are deep to dense till. They formed in loamy glaciolacustrine material 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) thick and in the underlying till. These soils are on beach ridges on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",

Zion, Pevely, Rainsville, Rawson, Richland, Shawtown, and Summitville series. All of these soils except Cazenovia and Summitville series have hue yellower than 5YR in the upper part of the series control section. Cazenovia soils formed entirely in till and do not have a densic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Summitville soils formed in colluvium and residuum and have rock fragments of shale or siltstone lithology."
