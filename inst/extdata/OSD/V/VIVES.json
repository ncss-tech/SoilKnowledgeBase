    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The reaction of the horizon above the Cca horizon ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has colors of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), very dark brown (10YR 2/2) dark brown (10YR 3/3; 7.5YR 3/2) or dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2, 3/3).  The A horizon is a clay or clay loam.\nThe color of the B horizon ranges from brown (7.5YR 4/4) through reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) or from reddish brown (5YR 4/4) through reddish yellow (5YR 6/8).  Texture of the B horizon is a clay or clay loam few or common.  Structure of B horizon is weak fine or medium subangular blocky.\nVolcanic rock fragments occur throughout the solum.  The C horizon includes the same colors as the B horizons, or as well as dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6, 5/3) or brownish yellow (10YR 6/6, 6/8).  Texture of C horizon is silt loam or clay loam.  Some pedons have gravel at depths below 40 inches."

Cornhill soils are calcareous throughout.  Guamani and Vieques soils have sandy-skeletal lower control sections.  Vieques soils and the Victory soils have a regular decrease in organic matter content with depth.  Diamond and Southgate soIl have hard rock within 20 inches of the surface.  Dique, Humacao, Limini, and Vivi soils have more humid soil moisture regimes.  Limani soils have lower base saturation.  Maguayo soils have clayey control sections.  Paso Seco soils have clayey over loamy skeletal control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Vives soils occur on nearly level to moderately sloping alluvial fans and terraces above the present river flood plains.  Slope gradients are 0 to 12 percent.  The regolith is fine and moderately fine textured sediments of mixed origin.  The climate is semiarid tropical.  The average annual rainfall varies from 25 to 45 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F."
