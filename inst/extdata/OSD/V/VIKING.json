  "OVERVIEW": "The Viking series consists of deep poorly drained soils that formed in clayey glacial till on lake plains.  These soils have very slow permeability.  They have slopes of 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum ranges from 20 to 36 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 9 to 18 inches in thickness.  Commonly these soils have free carbonates throughout, but some pedons lack free carbonates in part to all of the upper 10 inches.  The sola and C horizons typically contain 2 to 5 percent of coarse fragments of mixed lithology and mostly of gravel and cobble size.  Part or all of the A and the upper part of the B horizon in some pedons lack coarse fragments.  In other pedons a thin, discontinuous to continuous stone line is in the lower part of the A horizon or the upper part of the B horizon.  A few stones are on the surface of some pedons.  Between depths of 10 and 40 inches the content of clay ranges from 60 to 80 percent clay and from 5 to 20 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2 or is N 2/0 or N 3/0.  It typically is sandy clay loam or clay loam, but silty clay loam, clay or silty clay is within range.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has distinct or prominent mottles in some parts.  The main part of the B horizon is clay, but the upper part of some is silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Slickensides occur in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has a hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It commonly has mottles at least in the upper part.  The content of free carbonates gradually increases with depth to the C horizon, and the C horizon contains an equivalent of about 10 to 30 percent of calcium carbonate."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

The Dimmick, Dovray, Fargo, and Fulda soils are noncalcareous in the upper part of the control section and have 35 to 60 percent clay in the control section.  Grano soils have range between 45 and 60 percent clay in the control section.  Hegne soils have less clay in the control section and contain a calcic horizon with its upper boundary above a depth of 16 inches.  Ludden soils have between 40 to 60 percent clay in the control section."

The Viking soils formed in clayey till, but in some places the upper 18 inches or less consists of partially sorted to sorted sediments.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 37 to 43 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 24 inches."

Kittson soils are moderately well drained and are coarser textured.  Mavie and Rockwell soils are poorly drained, have a zone of lime accumulation, and are coarser textured.  Roliss soils are poorly and very poorly drained and are coarser textured."
