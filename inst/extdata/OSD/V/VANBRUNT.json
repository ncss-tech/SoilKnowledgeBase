  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Vanbrunt series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks, with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  These soils are on mountain ridges, shoulders, and backslopes. Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between a depth of 8 and 24 inches (or lithic contact) for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Solum is 16 to 25 inches thick.  Depth to a lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The upper 7 to 19 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.30 to 1.40 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.   The particle-size control section contains 3 to 8 percent clay and 35 to 70 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is stony, very stony, or very bouldery.  This horizon is 10 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 25 percent cobbles.  The surface is covered by 1 to 10 percent stones and boulders.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.  It is very gravelly, very cobbly, extremely cobbly, or extremely gravelly.  This horizon is 20 to 40 percent gravel, 10 to 40 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones.\nThe C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is extremely gravelly, very cobbly, or extremely cobbly. This horizon is 20 to 50 percent gravel, 15 to 30 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vanbrunt soils are on mountain ridges, shoulders, and backslopes.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks, with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Rock fragments and bedrock consist of granodiorite, quartz monzonite, diorite, and granitic gneiss.  In glaciated areas, these soils also contain a small component of granitic glacial till. Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  Elevations range from 1,800 to 4,600 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 69 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."

Donavan and Whitestone soils are on toeslopes, footslopes, and backslopes of foothills and mountains.  Merkel soils are on mountains.  Republic soils are on alluvial fans, terraces and backslopes and footslopes of mountains.  Mineral soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock, are frigid, and are on mountainsides and ridges. Swakane soils are 10 to 20 inches to bedrock, are mesic, and are on uplands, hills and mountains."
