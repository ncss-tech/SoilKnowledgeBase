  "OVERVIEW": "The Vanto series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, schist, and granitic sandstone and mudstone. Vanto soils are on low stream terraces of valley floors. Slopes are 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
