    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Vanto soils are on low stream terraces of valley floors. They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist, and Tertiary\nmicaceous sandstone and siltstone. Slopes are 1 to 3 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,500 to 6,200 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."

Bosquecito soils are coarse-loamy, have aquic conditions between 24 and 38 inches, and occur on flood plains. Cuyamungue soils are sandy-skeletal, lack diagnostic horizons, and occur on flood plains. Jaralosa soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, have aquic conditions between 3.5 and 5 feet, and occur on flood plains. Mirada soils are coarse-loamy, have ochric epipedons, and occur on flood plains of valley floors."
