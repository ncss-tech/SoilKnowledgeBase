  "OVERVIEW": "The Vitale series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from quartzitic sandstone, rhyolite, basalt, and welded rhyolitic tuff. Vitale soils are on lava plateaus,foothills and mountains. Slopes are 2 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
