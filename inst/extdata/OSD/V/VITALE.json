Clanalpine, Elaero, Heenlake and Squawtip soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Devaul, Heechee, Holmes, Horrocks, Howcan, Pequop and Wambolt soils are greater than 40 inches to bedrock. Hoskin soils have secondary carbonates in the subsoil. Suak soils have a very stony loam surface. Valmar soils have silt loam textures (less than 2mm) throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Vitale soils are on lava plateaus, foothills, and mountains. Slopes are 2 to 75 percent. They formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from quartzitic sandstone, limestone, welded tuff, rhyolite, basalt, and related rocks. Elevations are 4,000 to 8,000 feet. The climate is subhumid. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 20 inches. The mean annual temperature is 39 to 46 degrees F. Frost-free season is 50 to 110 days."

Povey soils have a mean summer soil temperature less than 59 degrees F and are on north and east-facing slopes. Milligan soils lack an argillic horizon. Blackspar soils lack a mollic epipedon and are shallow to bedrock."
