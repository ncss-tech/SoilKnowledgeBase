  "STATES": "KS,OK,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Vici series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian deposits derived from sandy alluvium from the Laverne Member, Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age.  These soils are on undulating to rolling dunes and sandsheets emplaced over hillslopes of the Southern High Plains, Breaks (MLRA 77E).  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm (21 in), and mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",
