  "OVERVIEW": "The Valatier series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from gneiss and schist. Valatier soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

The climate is low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in summer, typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 9 inches; mean annual air temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."
