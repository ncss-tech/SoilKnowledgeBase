  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Valatier soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from gneiss and schist. Elevations are 3,000 to 4,000 feet. The climate is low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in summer, typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 9 inches; mean annual air temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."
