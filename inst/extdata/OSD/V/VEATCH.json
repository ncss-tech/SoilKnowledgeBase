  "OVERVIEW": "The Veatch series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium, alluvium, and residuum, weathered mainly from sedimentary or fine-grained igneous bedrock.  Veatch soils are on mountain side slopes, escarpments, and structural benches.  Slopes range from 12 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
