  "OVERVIEW": "The Venson series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sedimentary rock of the Ventura member of the Midnight Peak formation. The volcanic ash mantle is 7 to 14 inches thick. These soil are on backslopes and shoulders of mountains. Slopes are 35 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 37 inches and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
