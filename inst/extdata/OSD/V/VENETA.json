  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 80 consecutive days during the summer. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 53 degrees to 55 degrees F. The sola are 40 to 60 inches thick. Hue in the sola is 10YR or 7.5YR. Depth to the 2Bct horizon is 24 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. It is moderately or strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry and chroma of 4 through 6. It is silty clay, clay loam, or clay and averages 35 to 45 percent clay in upper part of the Bt horizon and 55 to 65 percent clay in the 2Bct horizon. Few faint to distinct high chroma redox concentrations are below a depth of 20 inches in some pedons and redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are below a depth of 30 inches in other pedons.\nIntermittent thin contrasting layers are within the clay C horizons in some pedons. These layers are variegated light gray (10YR 7/1), strong brown (7.5YR 5/8), brown (7.5YR 5/4), and red (2.5YR 4/8) sandy loam to sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bateman, Freezener, Jumpoff, Lettia, Manzanita, Melbourne, Oak Grove, and Oakland series. Bateman soils lack a discontinuity, have 35 to 45 percent clay throughout the argillic horizon and are commonly mottled above a depth of 40 inches. Freezener soils lack the finer clay discontinuity and have moist hue redder than 7.5YR in the argillic horizon. Jumpoff soils lack the discontinuity in the argillic horizon, have less than 55 percent clay and lack mottles throughout. Lettia discontinuity in the argillic horizon, have less than 55 percent clay and lack mottles throughout. Lettia soils have an argillic horizon with 35 to 50 percent clay and 25 percent or more medium and coarser sand. Manzanita soils have moist value of 3 in some part of the B horizon, lack the fine clay discontinuity in the lower part of the argillic horizon and have mean annual soil temperature of about 57 degrees F. Oak Grove soils have an umbric epipedon, and have hue redder than 7.5YR in the B horizon. Oakland soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to paralithic contact."

The soils formed in stratified clayey mixed old alluvium. The climate consists of warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.; the average January temperature is about 39 degrees F; and the average July temperature is about 67 degrees F. The frost-free season is 160 to 235 days."

Bellpine soils have hue redder than 7.5YR and have less than 35 percent base saturation in the argillic horizon.  Hazelair soils are very fine textured and lack an argillic horizon. Linslaw soils have redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less at a depth of less than 30 inches and are somewhat poorly drained."
