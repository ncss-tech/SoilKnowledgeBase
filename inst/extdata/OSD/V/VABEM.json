    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is affected by peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer; Udic moisture regime bordering on Ustic.\nMean annual soil temperature:  about 41 degrees F\nMean summer soil temperature:  about 56 degrees F\nDepth to paralithic contact:  6 to 20 inches to interbedded sandstone and shale\nDepth to argillic horizon:  2 to 6 inches\nThickness of the mollic epipedon:  6 to 10 inches\nParticle-size control section (weighted average):\nClay content:  18 to 35 percent\nSand content:  10 to 70 percent\nRock fragments:  0 to 15 percent gravel and cobbles\nA horizon:\nHue:  7.5YR to 5Y\nValue:  4 to 5 dry, 2 to 3 moist\nESP:  0 to 15 percent\nChroma:  1 to 3 dry or moist\nReaction:  slightly acid to slightly alkaline\nBt2 horizon:\nHue:  7.5YR to 5Y\nValue:  5 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist\nChroma:  1 to 6 dry or moist\nTexture:  loam or clay loam\nClay content:  18 to 35 percent\nESP:  0 to 15 percent\nReaction:  neutral to slightly alkaline\nCOMPETING SERIES:  There are no competitors in this family. Similar and related series include the Inchauspie and Kimmons series.  The Inchauspie series differs in having bedrock between 20 and 40 inches.  The Kimmons series differs in having bedrock between 20 and 40 inches, in being calcareous in the lower solum and C horizons, and in having continuous horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation.\nGEOGRAPHIC SETTING:\nParent material: loamy slope alluvium and residuum derived from sedimentary rocks\nLandform:  sloping to steep upland hills and ridges\nSlopes:  6 to 40 percent\nElevation:  7,800 to 8,600 feet\nMean annual temperature:  about 38 degrees F\nMean annual precipitation:  about 18 inches at the type location with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer months\nFrost-free period:  ? to ? days.\nGEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Inchauspie and Kimmons series.  The Inchauspie series differs in having bedrock between 20 and 40 inches.  The Kimmons series differs in being calcareous in the lower solum and in having bedrock between 20 and 40 inches.\nDRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is medium to rapid. Permeability is moderate.\nUSE AND VEGETATION:  They are used principally as native pastureland. Native vegetation includes big sage, bluebunch wheatgrass, goldenweed, thickspike wheatgrass.\nDISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Present known distribution limited to southern and western Wyoming.  Series is of moderate extent.\nMLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana\nSERIES PROPOSED:  Sage Creek area, Carbon County, Wyoming, 1972.  Series name is a coined name.\nREMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 8 to 16 inches.  (Bt2 horizon)\nMollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 8 inches.  (A and Bt1 horizons)\nArgillic horizon:  The zone from 8 to 16 inches.  (Bt2 horizon)\nParalithic contact:  The contact with interbedded sandstone and shale at 16 inches.  (Cr layer)\nA paper revision and update of the series was made by MO6 August 2000.  The classification was changed from Argic Cryoborolls to Ustic Argicryolls.  Format and horizonation designations were updated.  It is assumed that the Bt1 does not qualify as an argillic horizon because it does not have the necessary clay increase.  The series has not been updated by the state since 1972.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Second Edition of Soil Taxonomy 1999.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
