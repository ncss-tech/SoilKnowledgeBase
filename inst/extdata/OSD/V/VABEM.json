  "REVDATE": "03/2001",
  "STATES": "CO,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Vabem series consists of  very shallow and shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy slope alluvium and residuum derived from sedimentary rocks.  These soils occur on hills and ridges.  Slopes range from 6 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 8 to 16 inches.  (Bt2 horizon)\nMollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 8 inches.  (A and Bt1 horizons)\nArgillic horizon:  The zone from 8 to 16 inches.  (Bt2 horizon)\nParalithic contact:  The contact with interbedded sandstone and shale at 16 inches.  (Cr layer)\nA paper revision and update of the series was made by MO6 August 2000.  The classification was changed from Argic Cryoborolls to Ustic Argicryolls.  Format and horizonation designations were updated.  It is assumed that the Bt1 does not qualify as an argillic horizon because it does not have the necessary clay increase.  The series has not been updated by the state since 1972.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Second Edition of Soil Taxonomy 1999.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
