  "OVERVIEW": "The Vailton series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountains at elevations of l,700 to 2,800 feet. Slopes are 5 to 90 percent.  Vailton soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium and residuum from siltstone and shale.  Average annual precipitation is about 80 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
