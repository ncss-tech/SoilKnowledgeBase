  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 65 degrees F. and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F. at any time.  The soil between the depths of 8 and 24 inches is moist in some or all parts from mid-December until mid-March and is dry throughout the remainder of the year.  Fine gravel of the soil profile ranges from 5 to 15 percent.  Organic matter is 1.0 to 2.0 percent to a depth of 9 to 12 inches and decrease irregularly throughout to depths  of 60 inches or more.  The upper few inches of the A horizon is slightly effervescent to noneffervescent and slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent below.\nThe A1 horizon is grayish brown, brown, or dark brown (10YR 5/2, 5/3, 4/3).  Moist colors are very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2, 3/3).  This horizon is sandy loam or fine sandy loam, but is usually sandy loam.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.  Structure ranges from weak to moderate, very fine to medium subangular blocky or the horizon is massive.  In areas that have been overwashed or overblown, the structure is weak to moderate, very thin to medium platy.\nThe C horizon in the control section is typically dark grayish brown, gray, grayish brown, brown, light brownish gray, pale brown, or light yellowish brown (10YR 4/2, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4).  Infrequently it is very pale brown or yellow (10YR 8/4, 7/4, 7/6, 8/6).  Moist colors are pale brown, grayish brown, gray, dark grayish brown, very dark grayish brown, dark brown, brown, yellowish brown, dark yellowish brown or very dark gray (10YR 6/3, 5/2, 5/1, 4/2, 3/2, 3/3, 5/3, 5/4, 4/3, 4/4, 3/1).  The control section is sandy loam or fine sandy loam with thin strata that range from loamy sand, sand, or gravelly sand to loam or clay loam that usually have 2 to 4 mm organic carbon streaks.  Below 40 inches colors are similar to those in the control section.  Texture range from coarse sand to sandy loam.  Commonly, dark gray or dark grayish brown strata of loam or clay loam occur at depths of 50 to more than 60 inches, and are mottled and have organic carbon streaks.  Mottles generally occur below 30 inches and are dark brown or strong brown in 7.5YR hue or yellowish brown in 10YR hue but may be yellowish red or reddish yellow in 5YR hue."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Anthony, Comoro, Gila, Grabe, Ireteba, Junction and Tobler series.  All of these are intermittently moist in summer and are well drained.  Also, Anthony, Gila, Ireteba, Junction and Tobler soils have moist value of 3.5 or more and less than 1 percent organic matter.  Grabe soils have a medium textured control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Victorville soils are on low river terraces and flood plains and have gradients of 0 to 2 percent.  Before being protected by watershed structures, they have been subjected to erratic flooding.  They formed in mixed alluvium derived mainly from granitic sources.  Elevations are 2,200 to 2,800 feet.  The climate is arid with hot summers and cool partly moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 4 or 5 inches, most of which falls as rainfall in winter or occasionally as snow.  The mean January temperature is 46 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 84 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 61 to 65 degrees F.  The frost free season is about 210 to 255 days."

The soils are moist less than 90 days both consecutively and cumulatively and cannot be Mollisols.
