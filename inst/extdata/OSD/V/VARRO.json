  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Varro series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy calcareous alluvium.  These soils are on nearly level flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth of alluvium ranges from about 10 to 40 feet.  The control section is stratified loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, and clay loam.  The clay content averages between 20 and 30 percent.  Bedding planes are evident throughout the soil below the A horizon and range from less than an inch to about two inches thick.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline and calcareous throughout.\nThe A horizon has colors with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons have moist values of 3 but these horizons are less than 7 inches thick.  The texture is mainly loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizons have colors with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Thin strata of black or very dark gray are in some pedons.  The 2 chroma colors are inherited from the high lime parent material."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family. Similar competing soils include the Bunyan, Clemville, Colorado, Energy, Norwood, and Severn series.  Bunyan soils are noncalcareous and members of the Ustic moisture regime.  Clemville and Norwood soils have fine-silty control sections.  Colorado and Energy soils are dry for longer periods and members of the Ustic moisture regime.  Severn soils have coarse-silty control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Varro soils are on nearly level natural levees in flood plains of streams.  Slopes are mainly less than 1 percent, but range up to 2 percent.  These soils formed in stratified, calcareous alluvium.  The climate is warm and humid to moist sub- humid.  The average annual precipitation ranges from about 38 to 55 inches.  The average annual temperature ranges from about 64 to 70 degrees F.  The Thronthwaite P-E index ranges from 50 to 80."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; medium internal drainage; moderate permeability.  Where unprotected, flooding occurs at intervals of about one to three times each year but water usually remains on the surface for less than 48 hours during any one flooding."
