  "OVERVIEW": "The Vandamine series consists of very deep, well drained soils on backslopes and shoulders of mountains. Vandamine soils are formed in colluvial and residual material derived from argillite with a mantle of volcanic ash. Slopes are 15 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
