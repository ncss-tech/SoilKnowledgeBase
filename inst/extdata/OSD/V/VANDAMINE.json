  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Vandamine series consists of very deep, well drained soils on backslopes and shoulders of mountains. Vandamine soils are formed in colluvial and residual material derived dominantly from argillite with a mantle of volcanic ash. In some areas, underlying parent material may include rhyolitic tuff. Elevations are 5,400 to 7,200 feet. Slopes are 15 to 90 percent. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 50 inches. The mean annual temperature is 33 to 41 degrees F. The frost-free period is 20 to 65 days."
