  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 35 to 60 inches. Depth to bedrock is 40 to 80 inches. Rock fragments of weathered shale, siltstone, and sandstone are less than 10 percent of the solum and range from 0 to 90 percent of the C horizon. Illite, kaolinite, and vermiculite clay minerals are rather evenly distributed with a relatively high amount of interstratified montmorillonite. The soil, unless limed, ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid in the A horizon, very strongly acid through slightly acid in the B horizons, and strongly acid through mildly alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Dry color value is 6 or more. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10R through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6 with hue of 7.5YR restricted to BA horizons. Redoximorphic features are in hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 8. Texture is silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is angular blocky but some pedons have subangular blocky and prismatic structure. Consistence is firm or very firm and slightly through\nvery sticky.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10R through 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6, and has redoximorphic features. Texture is silt loam to clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe clay shale or siltstone bedrock ranges from light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) through brown (10YR 4/3) to dark red (10R 3/6) and is calcareous in some pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the only series in this family at this time.  As other series are evaluated for cation exchange activity class, this may change.  Branchville, Celina, Hartville, Guernsey, Loudon, and Tarlton are in the active CEC class. Licking is in the semiactive CEC class. Lewisburg, Poorhouse, and Whippany series have not been evaluated and may become competitors.  None of these soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the solum. Whippany soils have\nhue of 5YR or redder only in the lower part of the B horizon, but it is not dominant."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Vandergrift soils are on hilltops, hillsides, benches, and footslopes with dominant slope of 3 to 8 percent, but ranges from 0 to 25 percent. These soils often are on relatively narrow, contour oriented, areas and are commonly in a complex with Wharton, Cavode, or Ernest soils. The soils weathered from interbedded calcareous and noncalcareous, red and gray shale, siltstone, and some limestone. The climate is humid and temperate; mean annual\nprecipitation ranges from 36 to 45 inches; mean annual air temperature ranges from 47 to 59 degrees F.; and the growing season ranges from 140 to 180 days."
