  "OVERVIEW": "The Vandergrift series consists of deep and very deep, moderately well and somewhat poorly drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from interbedded calcareous and noncalcareous, red and gray shale, siltstone, and limestone. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low to low. Mean annual precipitation is 1016 millimeters (40 inches). Mean annual temperature is 10.5 degrees C (51 F).",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 90 to 152 centimeters. Depth to bedrock is 100 to more than 200 centimeters. Rock fragments of dominantly soft shale, siltstone, and sandstone are 0 to 10 percent in the solum and range from 0 to 90 percent of the C horizon. Illite, kaolinite, and vermiculite clay minerals are rather evenly distributed with a relatively high amount of interstratified montmorillonite. The soil, unless limed, ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid in the A horizon, very strongly acid through slightly acid in the B horizons, and strongly acid through slightly alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Dry color value is 6 or more. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10R through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6 with hue of 7.5YR restricted to BA horizons. Redoximorphic features are in hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 8. Texture is silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is angular blocky but some pedons have subangular blocky and prismatic structure. Some pedons display faint slickensides. Consistence is firm or very firm and slightly through very sticky.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10R through 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 6. Texture is silt loam to clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe clay shale or siltstone bedrock ranges from light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) through brown (10YR 4/3) to dark red (10R 3/6) and is calcareous in some pedons."

Branchville, Cardinal, Celina, Eudy, Hartville, Jerktail, Licking, Loudon, Tarlton and Whippany are closely related but in the active CEC class. None of these soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the solum. Whippany soils have hue of 5YR or redder only in the lower part of the B horizon, but it is not dominant."

These soils often are on relatively narrow, contour oriented, areas and are commonly in a complex with Wharton, Cavode, or Ernest soils. The soils weathered from material derived from interbedded calcareous and noncalcareous, red and gray shale, siltstone, and some limestone. The climate is humid and temperate; mean annual precipitation ranges from 900 to 1100 millimeters; mean annual air temperature ranges from 9.5 to 11.5 degrees C; and the growing season ranges from 140 to 180 days."
