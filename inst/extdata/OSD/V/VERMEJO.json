  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Vermejo soils exist on mostly bottomland landforms such as valley floors, depressions, and drainageways but also exist on alluvial fans. These landforms may be dissected by shallow drainages. Slopes are generally under 5 percent. Elevation is 5,000 to 7,500 feet (1600 to 2286 meters). These soils formed on fine textured alluvium derived mostly from sandstone and shale. At the type location the climate is semiarid continental with an average annual precipitation of 13 to 19 inches (330 to 483 mm), of which more than 3/4 occurs during the months of April through September. The average annual temperature is 45 to 57 degrees F (7 to 14 degrees C). The frost free season is 130 to 180 days."

Litle and Mion soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches (102 cm). Swastika soils have an argillic horizon."

Native vegetation is alkali sacation, buffalograss, western wheat, galleta, prickly pear cactus, blue grama, fourwing saltbush, snakeweed, sideoats grama, and marigold. The saline phase generally has a good cover of grass which is dominated by alkali sacaton and inland saltgrass."
