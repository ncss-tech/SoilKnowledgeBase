Orange soils have redoximorphic features in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon and have a paralithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Zion and Orange soils are mesic due to the thermic/mesic break in MLRA 136. Wynott soils are well drained and have a paralithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 11 inches (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone between depths of 11 and 32 inches (Btss and Bt horizons)\nLithic contact--the occurrence of unweathered bedrock at a depth of 32 inches (upper boundary of the R horizon)"
