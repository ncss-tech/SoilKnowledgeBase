    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This series was formerly included with Iredell, Zion, Orange, Wilkes, and Wynott soils. Zion soils are well drained and have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Orange soils have redoximorphic features in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon and have a paralithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Zion and Orange soils are mesic due to the thermic/mesic break in MLRA 136. Wynott soils are well drained and have a paralithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 11 inches (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone between depths of 11 and 32 inches (Btss and Bt horizons)\nLithic contact--the occurrence of unweathered bedrock at a depth of 32 inches (upper boundary of the R horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Not available at this time.\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp  FrFr/Seas  Precip  Elevation\nVA     VIRGILINA   2-15   57-65    170-200    41-53   350-800\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH  Watertable  Kind    Months  Bedrock Hardness\nVA     NONE           1.0-2.0     PERCHED NOV-APR 20-40   HARD\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture      3-Inch No-10    Clay%   -CEC-\nVA      0-11  GR-SIL GR-L  0-3    70-90    8-27    7-15\nVA     11-28  C SIC SC     0-3    90-100  35-60   20-40\nVA     28-32  C SIC SICL   0-3    90-100  28-60   10-25\nVA     32     UWB           -       -       -       -\nSOI-5  Depth  -pH-     O.M.
