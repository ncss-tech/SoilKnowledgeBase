Zion soils are well drained and have a lithic contact at a depth of 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches). Orange soils have redoximorphic features in the upper 25 centimeters (10 inches) of the argillic horizon and have a paralithic contact at a depth of 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches). Zion and Orange soils are mesic due to the thermic/mesic break in MLRA 136. Wynott soils are well drained and have a paralithic contact at a depth of 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches).\nThe September 2025 revision reformatted the description to semi-tabular.  No data was changed.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 28 centimeters (11 inches) (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone between the depth of 28 to 81 centimeters (11 and 32 inches) (Btss and Bt horizons)\nLithic contact--the occurrence of unweathered bedrock at a depth of 81 centimeters (32 inches) (upper boundary of the R horizon)"
