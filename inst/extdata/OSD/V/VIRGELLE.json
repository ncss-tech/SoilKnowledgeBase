  "OVERVIEW": "The Virgelle series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed mainly in alluvium or eolian.  These soils are on stream terraces and till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
