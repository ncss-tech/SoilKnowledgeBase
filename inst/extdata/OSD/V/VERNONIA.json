  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F.  The soil is usually moist but is dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches during the summer.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has moderate or strong granular or subangular blocky structure.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and averages 24 to 40 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  This horizon has 0 to 20 percent partially weathered siltstone or shale fragments in the lower part in some pedons.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vernonia soils are on dissected mountains at elevations of 300 to 2,000 feet.  Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from siltstone or shale.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and warm moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 70 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 35 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 61 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 180 days."

Bacona soils have silty eolian overlay 2 to 3 feet thick and have 2Bt horizon with hue of 5YR or 2.5YR.  Glohm soils are moderately well drained and have a fragipan.  Kenusky soils are poorly drained and fine textured.  Mayger soils are somewhat poorly drained and fine textured.  Trask soils are loamy-skeletal and are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock."
