  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Vallan series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from rhyodacite and andesite with a minor component of glacial till.  The upper part also has an admixture of volcanic ash and loess.  These soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of glacially scoured foothills and mountains.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry between a depth of 8 inches and the lithic contact for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section is 10 to 18 percent clay and 5 to 25 percent rock fragments by weighted average.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist; and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.
