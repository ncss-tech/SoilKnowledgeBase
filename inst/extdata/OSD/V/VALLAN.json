These soils are usually moist but are dry between a depth of 8 inches and the lithic contact for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section is 10 to 18 percent clay and 5 to 25 percent rock fragments by weighted average.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist; and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is gravelly loam or loam and is 5 to 25 percent gravel, cobbles, and stones."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vallan soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of glacially scoured foothills and mountains.  These soils formed mainly in colluvium and residuum from rhyodacite and andesite, with a minor component of glacial till.  The upper part of the soil also contains an admixture of volcanic ash and loess.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  Elevations range from 3,000 to 5,500 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 15 to 25 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 23 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 120 days."
