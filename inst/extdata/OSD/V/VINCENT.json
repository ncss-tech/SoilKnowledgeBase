The solum is free or nearly free of coarse fragments and has a very low sand content, but the substratum may have up to 3 percent coarse fragments.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 (6 or more dry), and chroma of 2 to 4. Some pedons have an A horizon 1 to 5 inches thick with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. An E horizon, if present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. The Ap horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is neutral to strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is moderately acid to very strongly\nacid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 2.5YR, 10R (or 7.5Y in the upper part); value of 3 to 5; and chroma are 3 to 6. It is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam. There is mottling in some pedons, including low-chroma mottles at a depth below the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon. Structure is moderate or strong blocky and is arranged in weak to moderate medium to coarse prisms in some pedons. The 2Bt horizon is moderately acid to very strongly acid. The 2BC horizon is neutral to strongly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay that shows evidence of stratification and is laminated in some areas. It is moderately acid to mildly alkaline. Some pedons have free carbonates and have slight or strong effervescence."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Vincent soils are on gently sloping to steep slopes on dissected remnants of lacustrine areas in the Allegheny Plateau. Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent. The regolith includes a maximum of 20 inches of silty alluvium  or loess and clayey sediments that have reddish hues. The sediments in which the soils formed are derived, at least partly,  from areas of Upshur and Woodsfield soils of the nearby uplands. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 35 to 45 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from about 52 to 56 degrees F."
