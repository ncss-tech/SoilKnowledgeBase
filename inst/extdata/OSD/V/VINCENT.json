  "OVERVIEW": "The Vincent series consists of very deep moderately well drained soils formed in a thin layer of silty alluvium or loess and the underlying clayey lacustrine sediments on high terraces. These soils have slow permeability. Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches; mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
