  "OVERVIEW": "The Vanwirt series consist of very deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from granite, granodiorite, granodiorite gneiss, or quartz monzonite.  These soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent.   Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
