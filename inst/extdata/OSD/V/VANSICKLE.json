Depth to bedrock is 11 to 30 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.from early March to early December (275 days) and is above 47 degrees F. from early April until mid November (220 days).  The soil moisture control section (4 to 13 inches) is moist throughout from mid December until mid April (120 days) and is dry throughout from mid June until early November (140 to 160 days).  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 4/2 or 5/3.  Textures are very cobbly loam or extremely stony loam.  Rock fragments, mostly cobbles and stones, range from 35 to 60 percent.\nThe Bt horizon color is 5YR 4/2; 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, or 5/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/2; 5YR 3/3, 3/4 or 4/3.  Rock fragments, mostly cobbles and gravel, range from 35 to 60 percent.  The upper part has 35 to 40 percent clay and the lower part has 40 to 60 percent."
