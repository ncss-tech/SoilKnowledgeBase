July, August and November through March are the months that receive the greatest precipitation.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and falls as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain.  Mean annual air temperature is about 71 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 240 to 325 days."
