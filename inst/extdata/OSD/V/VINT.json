Elevations are 230 feet below sea level to 2500 feet above.  The climate is hot, arid continental, having hot summers and mild winters.  July, August and November through March are the months that receive the greatest precipitation.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and falls as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain.  Mean annual air temperature is about 71 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 240 to 325 days."
