  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges in thickness from 16 to 24 inches.  There is an irregular decrease in organic carbon.  Depth to bedrock exceeds 60 inches and has not been observed above 80 inches in any pedon.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature from 54 to 59 degrees F.  The particle size control section is stratified with contrasting textures but, when averaged, is loam or sandy loam with 5 to 18 percent clay, about 15 to 50 percent silt, and 32 to 70 percent sand.  Coarse fragments, when averaged, range from 0 to 35 percent throughout the control section.  A seasonal high water table fluctuates between 3 and 20 inches in April through August and between 10 and 30 inches in September through March.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Typically, the surface is covered with an organic mat from 1 to 4 inches thick.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe ABg or Bg horizon has matrix hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  When hue is 10YR, both low and high chroma redox features are present.  Neutral colors are common in some pedons as redox features or parts of peds.  When averaged, the texture is loam or sandy loam.  Few fine soft masses of segregated lime, gypsum, and salts more soluble than gypsum are not uncommon in the horizon, but the matrix is free of disseminated lime.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Neutral colors are common in parts of many ped faces as are redox depletions.  Texture, when averaged, is loam or sandy loam.  This horizon is typically thinly stratified with most coarse and moderately fine textures.  Segregation of gypsum and more soluble salts is common but occupies less than two percent of any horizon.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline."

Elevation is 7,000 to 8,500 feet.  The annual temperature is 33 to 41 degrees F.  The annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  The estimated frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
