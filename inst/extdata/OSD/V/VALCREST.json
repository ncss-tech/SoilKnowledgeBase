  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Valcrest soils are on fan remnants.  They typically occur on summit positions.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks with a component of loess.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,590 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Fortank, Pineval, Tomera, and Tulase soils.  Fortank soils are fine, moderately deep to paralithic contacts, and have argillic horizons.  Pineval soils are loamy-skeletal, have argillic horizons, and have horizons with firm consistence and a brittle manner of failure.  Tomera soils are fine and have horizons in the substratum with more than 35 percent rock fragments.  Tulase soils are coarse-silty and have horizons with durinodes."
