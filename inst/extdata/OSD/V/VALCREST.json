  "OVERVIEW": "The Valcrest series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks with a component of loess.  Valcrest soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",

These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks with a component of loess.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,590 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."

Pineval soils are loamy-skeletal, have argillic horizons, and have horizons with firm consistence and a brittle manner of failure.  Tomera soils are fine and have horizons in the substratum with more than 35 percent rock fragments.  Tulase soils are coarse-silty and have horizons with durinodes."
