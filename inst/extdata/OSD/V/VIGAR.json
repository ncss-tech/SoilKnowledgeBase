  "REVDATE": "06/2007",
  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Vigar series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in colluvium. These soils have moderately slow saturated hydraulic conductivity.  These soils are on toe slopes and have slopes of 2 to 9 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 11 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation is 890 millimeters.",
