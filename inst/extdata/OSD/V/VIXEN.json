  "OVERVIEW": "The Vixen soil series consists of deep, moderately well and well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from phyllite and schist on backslopes of mountainsides and footslopes of hills.  Slopes range from 5 to 100 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 180 inches and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

The texture is silt loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe hue of the C horizon ranges from 5YR to 10YR; value moist ranges from 3 to 5, and chroma moist is 3 or 4.  Texture in the C horizon is gravelly silt loam, gravelly sandy loam, or fine sandy loam."

The climax forest vegetation is usually 75 percent western hemlock and 25 percent Sitka spruce with a greater percentage of Sitka spruce in some areas.  The understory vegetation is blueberry, bunchberry dogwood, fernleaf gold thread, fiveleaf bramble, rusty menziesia, and woodfern."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are: an albic horizon from 0 to 1 inch; a spodic horizon from 1 to 8 inches; coarse-loamy material from 10 to 40 inches.  A cryic temperature regime is assumed.  That part of the spodic horizon that meets amorphous requirements does not extend more than 4 inches into the 10 to 40 inch control section.  The particle size of the control section has a significant relation to the physical and chemical properties of the soil.  The Vixen series is proposed as a benchmark soil series.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data is available on this soil:  NSSL number 82AK-130-000.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
