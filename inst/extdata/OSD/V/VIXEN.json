There is more than 6 percent organic carbon in the upper 4 inches of the spodic horizon.  The mean summer soil temperature is about 46 degrees.\nThe E horizon hue is neutral, 7.5YR, or 10YR.  Value moist ranges from 3 to 4; chroma moist from 0 to 2.  The texture is fine sandy loam or silt loam.\nHue of the B horizons ranges from 5YR to 10YR; with value moist of 2 or 3.  The texture is silt loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe hue of the C horizon ranges from 5YR to 10YR; value moist ranges from 3 to 5, and chroma moist is 3 or 4.  Texture in the C horizon is gravelly silt loam, gravelly sandy loam, or fine sandy loam."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Vixen soils occur on hillslopes and valleysides.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from phyllite and schist rocks, and are underlain by phyllite or schist. The climate is humid maritime with mean annual precipitation of 180 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 46 degrees F.  Slopes range from 5 to 100 percent.  Elevation ranges from 200 to 2000 feet."

The Tonowek and Tuxekan soils are formed in alluvium and are found in valleybottoms.  Tokeen soils are formed from granitic colluvium.  Ulloa soils are formed from residuum and colluvium from calcareous parent rocks."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  The Vixen soils are used for timber production, watershed protection, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  The climax forest vegetation is usually 75 percent western hemlock and 25 percent Sitka spruce with a greater percentage of Sitka spruce in some areas.  The understory vegetation is blueberry, bunchberry dogwood, fernleaf gold thread, fiveleaf bramble, rusty menziesia, and woodfern."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are: an albic horizon from 0 to 1 inch; a spodic horizon from 1 to 8 inches; coarse-loamy material from 10 to 40 inches.  A cryic temperature regime is assumed.  That part of the spodic horizon that meets amorphous requirements does not extend more than 4 inches into the 10 to 40 inch control section.  The particle size of the control section has a significant relation to the physical and chemical properties of the soil.  The Vixen series is proposed as a benchmark soil series.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data is available on this soil:  NSSL number 82AK-130-000.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
