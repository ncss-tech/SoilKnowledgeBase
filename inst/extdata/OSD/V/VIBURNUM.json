    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum is greater than 60 inches. Chert fragments are commonly smooth or partially rounded in the Bt and 2Bt and mostly angular in the 3Bt.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 or 3. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 20 percent. Texture is commonly silt loam but some pedons are gravelly silt loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E or BE horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 20 percent. Texture is silt loam or gravelly silt loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay or their gravelly analogs. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It has mottles with hue of 10YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 45 percent. Textures are silty clay loam or silty clay or their gravelly and very gravelly analogs. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe 3Bt horizon have hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8. Gravel content ranges from 15 to 80 percent. Texture of the fine earth is silty clay oclay. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Alloway soils formed in eolian material and marine sediments and have 0 to 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Doniphan and Macedonia soils do not have mottles with chroma of 2 or less within 30 inches of the surface. Lebanon and Plato soils have fragipans."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Viburnum soils are on gently to strongly sloping ridges and divides. They represent remnants of former plateaus dissected by stream entrenchment. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in a thin mantle of loess or silty colluvium, the underlying fine textured cherty colluvium, and the underlying cherty red clays. Rock fragments in the surface are the results of mixing during deposition by surface wash or a more recent effect of windthrow or burrowing animals."

Lebanon soils are on broader ridgetops. Macedonia soils are on similar positions. Goss soils are cherty throughout and are on lower positions."
