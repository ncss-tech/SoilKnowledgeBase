  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum ranges from 43 to 65 inches and that of the Bt horizons from 37 to 55.  Base saturation (by sum of cations) is less than 35 percent at 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon.  Exchange capacity in the major part of the argillic is between 16 and 24 meq. per 100 grams of clay.  Organic matter content is 0.8 percent or less in the upper 6 inches of the argillic horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Where the value is 3, it is less than 8 inches in thickness.  Texture is clay loam or silty clay.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 6; or it is multicolored in shades of red and yellow.  Iron accumulations in shades of yellow and red range from none to common.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 6; or it is multicolored in shades of red, brown, or yellow.  Iron accumulations in shades of yellow, brown, or red range from none to common.  Iron depletions in shades of gray occur below a depth of 30 inches and range from few to many.  Soft masses of manganese range from few to many throughout.  Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe C horizon has no dominant color and is multicolored in shades of red, yellow, brown, and gray.  Soft masses of manganese range from few to many.  Texture is clay."

The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 72 to 80 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 76 to 78 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Bajura, Coloso, Rio Piedras, Toa, and Vega Baja soils.  The Bajura, Coloso, and Toa soils are on lower flood plain positions.  In addition, Bajura soils are poorly drained and are Mollisols, Coloso soils are somewhat poorly drained, and Toa soils are Mollisols.  The moderately well drained Rio Piedras soils are on similar positions but are underlain by highly weathered, thinly bedded siltstone and are Mollisols.  The somewhat poorly drained Vega Baja soils are on slightly lower terrace positions and have higher exchange capacity."

Other data show that these soils have 10 percent or more weatherable minerals in the 20 to 200 micron fraction of the upper 40 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization pedon - San Juan SCD, Puerto Rico; S61PR127-002.
