  "OVERVIEW": "The Vega Alta series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on uplands and terraces.  They formed in clayey, iron-rich coastal plain sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 76 inches.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.",

Base saturation (by sum of cations) is less than 35 percent at 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon.  Exchange capacity in the major part of the argillic is between 16 and 24 meq. per 100 grams of clay.  Organic matter content is 0.8 percent or less in the upper 6 inches of the argillic horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Where the value is 3, it is less than 8 inches in thickness.  Texture is clay loam or silty clay.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 6; or it is multicolored in shades of red and yellow.  Iron accumulations in shades of yellow and red range from none to common.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 6; or it is multicolored in shades of red, brown, or yellow.  Iron accumulations in shades of yellow, brown, or red range from none to common.  Iron depletions in shades of gray occur below a depth of 30 inches and range from few to many.  Soft masses of manganese range from few to many throughout.  Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe C horizon has no dominant color and is multicolored in shades of red, yellow, brown, and gray.  Soft masses of manganese range from few to many.  Texture is clay."

In addition, Bajura soils are poorly drained and are Mollisols, Coloso soils are somewhat poorly drained, and Toa soils are Mollisols.  The moderately well drained Rio Piedras soils are on similar positions but are underlain by highly weathered, thinly bedded siltstone and are Mollisols.  The somewhat poorly drained Vega Baja soils are on slightly lower terrace positions and have higher exchange capacity."
