  "OVERVIEW": "The Vanstel series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or in colluvium derived from semiconsolidated shale, siltstone, and sandstone.  These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, stream terraces, and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
