Chrisflat, Dogbed, Krenka, Murain, Snyderville, Softback, and Softscrabble soils are very deep.  Erig soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Leroman and Staberg soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Lockgate soils are deep to paralithic contacts."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vipont soils are on hills, mountains, and cuestas.  They typically occur on backslope or scarp face positions.  These soils formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from sandstone, quartzite, and mica schist.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1,525 to 2,135 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 560 mm, the mean annual temperature is 3.9 to 7.2 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
