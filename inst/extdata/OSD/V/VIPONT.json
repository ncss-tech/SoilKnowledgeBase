  "OVERVIEW": "The Vipont series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from sandstone, quartzite, and mica schist.  Vipont soils are on hills, mountains, and cuestas.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.",
