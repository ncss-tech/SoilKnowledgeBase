  "OVERVIEW": "The Veet series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived from andesitic, welded tuff, and granitic rocks. Veet soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, fan skirts, inset fans, and axial stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 225 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",

Cewat soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Darkcanyon and Felchersoils are 50 to 100 cm deep to hard bedrock. Finley soils have secondary calcium carbonate and silica coats on bottom of rock fragments in Bw horizon and have an extremely gravelly 2C horizon. Kiona soils have textures of silt loam, very fine sandy loam or loam in the control section. Minat soils are 50 to 76 cm to bottom of Bw horizon. Nibbs soils contain 15 to 25 percent clay in the Bw horizon. Wifton soils contain 60 to 80 percent rock fragments."
