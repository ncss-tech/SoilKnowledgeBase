  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum is 20 to 40 inches, and corresponds to the depth to the petrocalcic horizon.  The soil is mildly or moderately alkaline throughout, but is noncalcareous in the upper 14 to 30 inches.  This corresponds to the depth to secondary carbonates.\nThe A horizon is brown (10YR 5/3) or grayish brown (10YR 5/2).  It is fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon is grayish brown (10YR 5/2) or brown (10YR 5/3). It is fine sandy loam or loam with less than 18 percent clay.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, gravelly loam or gravelly sandy loam.  The clay content ranges from 10 to 18 percent.  It contains 10 to 30 percent by volume concretions and nodules of calcium carbonate and indurated caliche fragments and the amounts increase with depth.  Some pedons contain common strongly cemented calcareous sandstone fragments in the lower part.\nThe Bkm horizon is white (10YR 8/2) or very pale brown (10YR 8/3, 8/4).  It is fractured and consists of cemented or indurated calcium carbonate containing seams and pockets of weakly cemented caliche.  The cementation becomes weaker with depth."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Dant series in the same family and the Hidalgo, Olmos, Pernitas, Pettus, Rehm, Sarnosa, Shiner, and Valco series.  Dant soils are formed over clayey marine sediments.  All of these soils are calcareous.  In addition, Hidalgo soils formed over loamy alluvium.  Pernitas soils have Bt horizons.  Pettus and Rehm soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in their sola.  Pettus and Shiner have carbonatic mineralogy.  Valco soils have sola less than 20 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vargas soils have plane to slightly concave slopes with gradients of 0 to 1 percent.  They formed in calcareous loamy sediments of Pleistocene or Pliocene Age that are somewhat stratified with weakly to strongly cemented layers.  Climate is semiarid with mean annual precipitation ranging from 22 to 25 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F. Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 26 to about 30."

Comitas, Delmita and Nueces soils have argillic horizons and occur on similar surfaces.  Yturria soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick.  Jardin soils have sola less than 20 inches thick. Yturria and Jardin soils occur at slightly higher elevations."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Used entirely for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation in excellent condition is composed of 90 percent grasses, 5 percent woody plants and 5 percent forbs. In excellent condition mid grasses such as plains bristlegrass, hooded windmillgrass, twoflower trichloris, feathery bluestem, Arizona cottontop and pink pappusgrass dominate.  Major forbs include bundleflower, bushsunflower, orange zexmenia and guara.  Dominant woody plants are mesquite, whitebrush, blackbrush, spiny hackberry, Condalia spp., lime pricklyash, Texas persimmon and desert yaupon.  Amounts of woody species increase during extended periods of overgrazing."
