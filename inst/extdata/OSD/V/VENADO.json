  "OVERVIEW": "The Venado series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in fine textured alluvium derived from dominantly serpentinitic minerals. Venado soils are in basins. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 59 degrees F.",
