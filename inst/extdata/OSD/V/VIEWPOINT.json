Beje soils are drier in the spring and typically are more alkaline and have hue yellower than 7.5YR.  Berland soils are very shallow and have less than 15 percent rock fragments. Bonjea soils are drier and have mean summer soil temperatures of 60 to 68 degrees F. Cedric soils have granite rock fragments dominantly 2 to 10 mm in diameter and have accumulations of secondary calcium carbonate. Coni soils are more moist in the late spring and early summer and typically have hue yellower than 7.5YR. Connieo soils have granitic rock fragments dominantly 2 to 7 mm in diameter. Kiln soils are drier, have less than 35 percent medium and coarser sand in the argillic horizon, and are typically more alkaline. Skyute soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments."

The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 24 inches with more than 50 percent falling as snow from winter storms. The mean annual temperature is 39 to 42 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 60 to 100 days."
