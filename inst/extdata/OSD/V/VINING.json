  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vining soils are on level to hilly basalt plains and terraces covered by eolian and alluvial material of mixed origin.  Most slopes are short and irregular.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent, but are principally from 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 2,500 to 5,000 feet.  The climate is semiarid and has relatively dry summers.  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, and the average annual air temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F.  Frost free season is 80 to 140 days."
