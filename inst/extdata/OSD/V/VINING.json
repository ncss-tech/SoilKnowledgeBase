  "OVERVIEW": "The Vining series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on basalt plains and terraces.  They formed in eolian material and alluvium from mixed sources.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent, but are principally from 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 2,500 to 5,000 feet.  The climate is semiarid and has relatively dry summers.  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, and the average annual air temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F.  Frost free season is 80 to 140 days."
