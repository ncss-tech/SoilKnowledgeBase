  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 47 to 52 degrees F.. These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice. There are cracks 1/2 to 3/4 inch in width and 20 to 35 inches in depth that open and close each year in the fall after irrigation season. Depth to aquic conditions and the irrigation-induced water table is 30 to 60 inches. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 30 to 60 inches. The upper 7 to 9 inches has an estimated volcanic glass content of 5 to 10 percent and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid oxalate iron of 0.2 to 0.4 percent. Base saturation throughout upper 30 inches is greater than 75 percent. The particle-size control section has 45 to 60 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. It has 0 to 10 percent rock fragments by volume. Organic matter is estimated to range from 3 to 5 percent in the Ap and A horizon. The depth to the 2Bss horizon with less than 20 percent rock fragments is 40 to 50 inches.\nThe Ap and A horizons have value of 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 dry.  It has 45 to 60 percent clay.\nThe Bss horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3, dry or moist. It has 0 to 10 percent rock fragments and 45 to 60 percent clay.\nThe 2Bss horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3, dry or moist. Texture is clay, sandy clay or gravelly sandy clay with 35 to 45 percent clay and 0 to 20 percent gravel."

Elevation is 1,500 to 2,400 feet. These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches. The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 69 degrees F. The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F.
