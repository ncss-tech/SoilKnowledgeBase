  "OVERVIEW": "The Varodale series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium with an influence of volcanic ash. Varodale soils are on terraces and [SW1]alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice. There are cracks 1/2 to 3/4 inch in width and 20 to 35 inches in depth that open and close each year in the fall after irrigation season. Depth to aquic conditions and the irrigation-induced water table is 30 to 60 inches. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 30 to 60 inches. The upper 7 to 9 inches has an estimated volcanic glass content of 5 to 10 percent and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid oxalate iron of 0.2 to 0.4 percent. Base saturation throughout upper 30 inches is greater than 75 percent. The particle-size control section has 45 to 60 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. It has 0 to 10 percent rock fragments by volume. Organic matter is estimated to range from 3 to 5 percent in the Ap and A horizon. The depth to the 2Bss horizon with less than 20 percent rock fragments is 40 to 50 inches.\nThe Ap and A horizons have value of 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 dry.
