  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Villario series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to cemented shale bedrock. Villario soils formed in colluvium derived from sandstone and shale over residuum weathered from  shale. They are on backslopes  of scarp slopes of mesas and plateaus. Slopes are 30 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
