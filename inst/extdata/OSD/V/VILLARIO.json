    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Villario soils are on backslopes of scarp slopes of mesas and plateaus.  They formed in colluvium derived from sandstone and shale over residuum weathered from shale of the Triassic Age Chinle Formation. Slopes are 30 to 45 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,000 to 7,100 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."

Arojomil soils are moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon and are on summits and shoulders of undulating plateaus. Horchata soils are moderately deep to sandstone, have a calcic horizon, and occur on summits. Kech soils are shallow to hard sandstone bedrock, have a calcic horizon, and occur on shoulders and beveled summits. Kinsell soils are fine-silty, have a mollic epipedon, and occur on floodplains and channels of valley floors."
