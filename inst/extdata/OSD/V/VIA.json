  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to the 2C gravelly horizons vary from 30 to 60 inches.  Few to many rock fragments are found in the solum.  Soil reaction ranges from extremely acid in the surface to slightly acid in the lower horizons.  Mineralogy is mixed.  Mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches depth is from 72 to 78 degrees F. and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soils temperatures is less than 9 degrees F.  Base saturation (by sum of cations) is 35 percent or more at 50 inches from the top of the argillic horizon.  These soils are usually moist and never dry for as long as 90 cumulative days in most years.\nThe A horizons have textures that range from silty clay loam to clay loam.  The colors are in hues of 10YR to 5YR, values of 4 to 5, chromas of 2 to 4.\nThe Bt horizons have textures from silty clay loam to clay loam but are always less than 35 percent clay.  Colors are in hues of 7.5YR and 5 YR, values of 4 to 6 and chromas of 4 to 8.  Structure varies from weak medium to coarse subangular blocky.  Clay films vary from few faint to common distinct.\nRock fragments in the 2C horizons vary from 50 to 80 percent by volume."

The San Sebastian soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in their argillic horizons.  The Juncal soils have more than 35 percent clay in their argillic horizons.  The Tanama soils have hard rock within 20 inches of the surface.  The Rio Arriba soils have subhorizons with more than 0.09 COLE values.  The Amelia, Machete and Glynn soils have subhorizons that are dry for 90 cumulative days or more in most years.  The Fajardo soils have argillic horizon that extend beyond 60 inches of the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Via soils occur on gently to moderately sloping high stream terraces, with slope gradients from 2 to 12 percent.  The regolith consists of moderately fine textured sediments underlaid by coarse textured gravelly or cobbly sediments.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual rainfall ranges from 70 to 80 inches and the average annual temperature is 78 degrees F.\nGEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS.  These are the Rio Arriba, Mabi, Junquitos, Mucara and Naranjito series.  The Rio Arriba soils occur in similiar positions but have fine textured sola and mottled red fine textured parent materials.  The Mabi soils occupy alluvial fan positions and have high COLE values.  The Junquitos soils occupy footslopes and alluvial fan positions and have low chroma mottles in their profiles.  The Mucara and Naranjito soils are on steep sideslopes and are underlaid by volcanic rock."
