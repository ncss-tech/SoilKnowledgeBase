This change meant that very shallow soils could no longer be included in the series (because the cambic horizon must extend deeper than 10 inches). Very shallow soils were determined to be of minor extent. This revision also restricted the moisture regime to typic ustic, and deleted Engelmann's spruce and white fir from the characteristic plant community.\nThe series concept needs to be narrowed further, particularly the climatic properties.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
