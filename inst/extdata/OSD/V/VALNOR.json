  "OVERVIEW": "The Valnor series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from interbedded shale and sandstone on high plateaus, hills, ridges and mesas. Slopes are 2 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
