  "OVERVIEW": "The Vernon series consists of moderately deep over claystone bedrock, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum derived from noncemented claystone bedrock or dense clay of Permian age. These very gently sloping to steep soils occur on hillslopes, pediments, and escarpments on dissected plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 16.7 degrees C (62 degrees F).",
