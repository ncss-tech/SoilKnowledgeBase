  "OVERVIEW": "The Vium series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks. Vium soils are on pediments and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",

Etinarg soils have 18 to 25 percent clay in the control section. Hoot soils contain 50 to 70 percent rock fragments throughout the profile and are noneffervescent in the A and Bt horizons. Mirkwood soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section, are 36 cm or less to a lithic contact, and are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days between July and September. Theon soils have 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Tognoni soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section, have 35 to 45 percent clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon, and are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days between July and September. Valleycity soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Waucoba soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are 36 to 50 cm to lithic contacts."
