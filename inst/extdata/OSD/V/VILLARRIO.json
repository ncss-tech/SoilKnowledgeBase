  "OVERVIEW": "The Villarrio series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to soft shale bedrock. Villarrio soils formed in colluvium and slope alluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale. They are on backslopes of undulating plateaus. Slopes are 20 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Elevation ranges from 6,000 to 7,000 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.

Horchata soils are moderately deep to sandstone, have a calcic horizon, and occur on summits. Kech soils are shallow to hard sandstone bedrock, have a calcic horizon, and occur on shoulders and beveled summits. Kinsell soils are fine-silty, have a mollic epipedon, and occur on floodplains and channels of valley floors."
