  "OVERVIEW": "The Vista series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from decomposed granitic rocks.  Vista soils are on hills and mountainous uplands and have slopes of 2 to  85 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 40 cm (16 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about  17 degrees C (62 degrees F).",
