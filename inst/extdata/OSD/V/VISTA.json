Slopes range from 2 to 75 percent.  The soils formed in material weathered from decomposed granite and other closely related rocks.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal.  The average annual precipitation is 254 to 559 mm (10 to 22 inches).  The average January temperature is 8 to 14 degrees C (47 to 58 degrees F); the average July temperature is 19 to 27 degrees C (67 to 80 degrees F); and the mean annual temperature is 15 to 18 degrees C (59 to 65 degrees F).  The average frost free season is 210 to 320 days."

Cieneba soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of less than 50 cm.  Crouch soils have a mollic epipdeon >25 cm thick and are deep to granitic bedrock.  Fallbrook soils have fine-loamy particel size control section and have an argillic horizon.  Las Posas soils have a fine textured argillic horizon and is formed in weathered gabbro.  Ramona soils have reddish brown argillic horizons formed in granitic alluvium.  Saugus soils lack a cambic horizon and are deep to a paralithic contact."

On areas of moderate relief, grain and hay are grown without irrigation.  Range is a common use in areas that are not cultivated.  The natural vegetation is annual grasses and forbs and such shrubs as California sagebrush, scrub oak, lilac, chamise, sumac, and flattop buckwheat."
