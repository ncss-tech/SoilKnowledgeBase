  "OVERVIEW": "The Valley series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in Wisconsinan age fine-textured glaciolacustrine sediments underlain by till. These soils are in depressions on till plains. Permeability is slow or very slow in the solum and slow in the underlying material. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 36 inches.",
