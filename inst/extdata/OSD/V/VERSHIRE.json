  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 13 to 36 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent by volume with the higher percentage usually in the lower horizons.  Rock fragments are mainly schist, phyllite, quartz, quartzite, shale and metamorphosed limestone.  Reaction ranges from  very strongly acid through slightly acid in the solum and very strongly acid through neutral in the substratum.  Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Dry color value is 5 or less.  Undisturbed pedons have an A horizon with color similar to the Ap horizon.  It is up to 8 inches thick.\nSome undisturbed pedons have a thin, discontinuous E horizon  that has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is up to 2 inches thick.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, and value and chroma of 2 to 4.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with color similar to the Bw horizon.  It is up to 5 inches thick.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nSome pedons have a Cr horizon that has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 3.  Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand,  fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.  It is up to 3 inches thick.\nBedrock is hard, interbedded phyllite and metamorphosed limestone or schist."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vershire soils are level to very steep soils on tops and sideslopes of hills, ridges, and mountains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent.  The soils developed in glacial till of Wisconsin age derived mainly from phyllite interbedded with metamorphosed limestone.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees Fahrenheit.   Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 46 inches.  The frost free season ranges from 90 to 135 days. Elevations range from 500 to 1750 feet above mean sea level."

The poorly drained Cabot and very poorly drained Peacham soils are in depressions and drainageways. The moderately well drained Buckland and Fullam soils and the well drained Dummerston and Shelburne soils are in lower positions on the landscape,  The somewhat excessively drained Glover and Pomfret soils are in similar positions on the landscape.  Glover soils are shallow to bedrock and Pomfret soils are sandy."

The former classification is Coarse-loamy, mixed, frigid Typic Haplumbrepts.\n2.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Umbric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 9 inches (Ap horizon).\nb.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 9 to 17 inches (Bw horizon).\nc.  Lithic feature - Bedrock at 36 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL Laboratory data is available for the following pedons: S74VT-17-7, S74VT-17-8, S84-VT-023, S86VT-23-1, S86VT-23-3, and S86VT-23-5.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
