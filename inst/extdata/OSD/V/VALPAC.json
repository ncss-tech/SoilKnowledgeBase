  "OVERVIEW": "The Valpac series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Valpac soils are on natural levees of high flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

The soil is dry between 6 and 19 inches in most years from June 15 to October 15, moist in all parts from December 1 to May 15 and moist in some part the rest of the year.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature ranges from 30 to 33 degrees F.  If undrained, these soils are saturated at a depth of 36 to 40 inches for 90 consecutive days from about December through April in most years.  Weighted average clay content for the 10 to 40 inch control section is 20 to 35 percent and fine sand and coarser material is greater than 15 percent.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Organic matter is 1 to 3 percent in the upper 10 inches and decreases irregularly with depth.  One or more buried A horizons are at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  These soils are noncalcareous.\nThe Ap horizons are 10YR 5/2, 5/1, 4/2, 4/1; or 2.5Y 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/1, or 2/2.  Overwash material with dry color of 10YR 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 5/4 may be mixed in some pedons. Texture of lower subhorizons is loam, silt loam or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay.  Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 7/2, 7/1, 6/3, 6/2; or 2.5Y 6/2.  Moist color is 10YR 5/2, 4/3, 4/2, 4/1, 3/2 or 2.5Y 4/2.  It is stratified fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, silt loam or clay loam with 15 to 30 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly to moderately alkaline.\nThe Ab and A'b horizons are 10YR 6/1, 5/2, 5/1, 4/1; or 2.5Y 6/2.  Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 3/2, 3/1, 2/2, or 2/1.  Texture is loam, clay loam or silty clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly to moderately alkaline.\nThe C' horizon is similar in texture, color and reaction to the 2C horizon."
