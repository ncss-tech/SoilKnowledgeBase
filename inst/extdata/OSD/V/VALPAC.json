    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 62 to 65 degrees F and the temperature remains above 47 degrees F throughout the year.  The soil is dry between 6 and 19 inches in most years from June 15 to October 15, moist in all parts from December 1 to May 15 and moist in some part the rest of the year.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature ranges from 30 to 33 degrees F.  If undrained, these soils are saturated at a depth of 36 to 40 inches for 90 consecutive days from about December through April in most years.  Weighted average clay content for the 10 to 40 inch control section is 20 to 35 percent and fine sand and coarser material is greater than 15 percent.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Organic matter is 1 to 3 percent in the upper 10 inches and decreases irregularly with depth.  One or more buried A horizons are at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  These soils are noncalcareous.\nThe Ap horizons are 10YR 5/2, 5/1, 4/2, 4/1; or 2.5Y 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/1, or 2/2.  Overwash material with dry color of 10YR 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 5/4 may be mixed in some pedons. Texture of lower subhorizons is loam, silt loam or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay.  Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 7/2, 7/1, 6/3, 6/2; or 2.5Y 6/2.  Moist color is 10YR 5/2, 4/3, 4/2, 4/1, 3/2 or 2.5Y 4/2.  It is stratified fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, silt loam or clay loam with 15 to 30 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly to moderately alkaline.\nThe Ab and A'b horizons are 10YR 6/1, 5/2, 5/1, 4/1; or 2.5Y 6/2.  Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 3/2, 3/1, 2/2, or 2/1.  Texture is loam, clay loam or silty clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly to moderately alkaline.\nThe C' horizon is similar in texture, color and reaction to the 2C horizon."

Blucher and Pacheco soils have a difference of 15 to 18 degrees F, respectively, between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature.  Lakeside soils are calcareous and saline-alkali and are moist for 120 consecutive days.  Mocho soils are calcareous and lack buried A horizons.  Nueva soils lack clay loam layers above 40 inches have moderate permeability above 40 inches and if undrained, have a water table below 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  The climate is dry subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches.  The average January temperature is 46 degrees F, the average July temperature is 76 degrees F and the mean annual temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 275 to 300 days."

Sailboat soils have an ochric epipedon and are on natural levees of the low flood plain.  Scribner soils have a mollic epipedon greater than 24 inches thick and are on edges of backswamps."
