Mean annual soil temperature is 64 to 67 degrees F at 20 inches and remains above 47 degrees F throughout the year.  The soil is dry between 7 inches and 34 inches or to the duripan in most years from June 1 to October 15, moist in all parts from December 1 to May 1 and moist in some part the rest of the year.  Weighted average clay content of the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon is 40 to 60 percent.  Increase in clay content at the upper boundary of the argillic horizon is 20 to 40 percent within 1 inch.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 6/1, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/1, or 7/2.

Distinct or prominent high value and chroma mottles are present in the upper 4 to 12 inches.  Reaction is medium acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a BA horizon.  Dry color is 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6, 6/4, or 6/6.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/6, or 5/6.  Texture is similar to the A horizon and clay content is 1 to 3 percent more than in the A horizon.  Reaction is medium acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon is 2.5Y 7/2, 6/2; 5Y 7/1, or 6/2.  Moist color is 2.5Y 5/2; 5Y 4/1, or 4/2.

Slopes are 2 to 30 percent and are commonly concave.  These soils formed in material weathered from weakly consolidated rhyolitic tuffaceous sediments of the Valley Springs Formation overlain by hillslope alluvium of mixed origin.  Climate is sub-humid, with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 19 to 23 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 60 to 61 degrees F; average January temperature is 44 degrees F; and average July temperature is 77 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 250 to 275 days."
