  "STATES": "AL,LA,MS",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Vaiden series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey sediments overlying chalk or calcareous clays.  They are on uplands and old stream terraces of the Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas Blackland Prairie and the Southern Coastal Plain major land resource areas.  Near the type location, the average annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 53 inches.  Slopes are dominantly 0 to 5 percent but range to 17 percent.",

Depth to chalk bedrock characterized as a paralithic contact is 60 inches or more.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, clay, or silty clay.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Btss horizon or the Bt horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Iron depletions in shades of gray and iron accumulations in shades of brown and red range from common to many.  Some pedons lack a dominant matrix color and are multi-colored in shades of brown, gray, red, and yellow.  Concretions and/or soft masses of manganese range from none to common.  Texture is clay.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bss horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, and value of 5 or 6.  Chroma ranges from 4 to 8 in ped interiors and is 1 or 2 on ped exteriors or slickenside faces.  Some pedons do not have a dominant matrix color and are multi-colored in shades of gray, brown, olive, and red.  Iron depletions in shades of gray and iron accumulations in shades of brown and red range from common to many.  Concretions and/or soft masses of manganese range from none to common.  Texture is clay.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bkss horizon, present in most pedons, has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y and value of 4 to 6.  Chroma ranges from 4 to 6 in ped interiors and is 1 or 2 on the exterior of peds or slickenside faces.  Some pedons do not have a dominant matrix color and are multi-colored in shades of gray, brown, and olive.  Iron depletions in shades of gray and iron accumulations in shades of brown range from few to many and are most common on surfaces of peds or slickensides.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  Reaction is commonly slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline, but ranges to neutral.  Soft masses and nodules or concretions of calcium carbonate range from few to many.  Soft masses and/or concretions of manganese range from none to common.\nThe 2C horizon, present in some pedons, is highly weathered chalk or calcareous clay.  It is massive or has platy rock structure. Some pedons have a 2Cr horizon below a depth of 60 inches that is weathered chalk bedrock.  It can be dug with difficulty with hand tools and is rippable by heavy equipment."

Brooksville and Faunsdale soils are on lower slopes and are neutral to moderately alkaline throughout.  The poorly drained Eutaw soils are in slightly depressed positions and are dominantly gray in the upper part of the solum.  Houston and Okolona soils are on slightly more convex positions and have thick dark colored surface horizons.  Keiffer, Maytag, and Sumter soils are on slightly higher positions and are calcareous to the surface.  Kipling soils are on similar positions as Vaiden soils and have fine textured argillic horizons.  Louin soils are on similar positions as Vaiden soils and average less than 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Oktibbeha soils are on higher, more convex slopes and have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR in the upper part of the solum.  Sucarnoochee soils are in flood plains and are neutral to moderately alkaline throughout."
