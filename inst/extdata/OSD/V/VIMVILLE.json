  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  The A horizon and E horizon range from very strongly acid to slightly acid.  The B/E horizon is strongly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  In some pedons, plowing has blended the A and E horizons.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe B/E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or it is neutral with value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 0.  The B part, which is the peds, either has few to many mottles in shades of brown, red, gray, or yellow.  In some pedons, the lower part of the B/E horizon is mottled in these colors.  Texture is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam and contains 18 to 35 percent clay.  The structure is weak to moderate, and fine to coarse prismatic that parts to subangular blocky.  The E part consists of gray tongues, streaks, and pockets of loam, silt loam, sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam between the prisms that make up from 15 to 35 percent of the horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Colita and Waller series in the same family and the closely related soils of the Alikchi, Basile, Caddo, Calhoun, Daleville, Fountain, Frost, Gessner, Griflon, Guyton, Mollville, and Ozan series.  Colita soils have a paralithic contact to tuffaceous shale at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Waller soils have A and E horizons with a combined thickness of 20 inches or more.  The Alikchi, Basile, Caddo, Calhoun, Fountain, Frost, and Guyton soils have a fine-silty control section; also, Basile, Calhoun, Fountain, and Frost soils have mixed mineralogy.  Daleville soils have less than 35 percent base saturation.  Gessner and Ozan soils have a coarse-loamy control section.  Grifton soils do not have tongues of albic material in the Bt horizon.  Mollville soils have mixed mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Vimville soils formed in loamy marine or fluvial sediments.  These are nearly level soils on uplands and terraces of the Southern Coastal Plains Major Land Resource Area.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The climate is warm and humid.  Mean annual precipitation is about 52 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees Fahrenheit."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Daleville series and the Quitman and Rosella series.  Poorly drained Daleville soils are in similar positions as the Vimville soils.  Moderately well drained Quitman soils, which have a browner B horizon, are on slightly higher parts of the landscape.  Poorly drained Rosella soils, which are on similar landscapes as the Vimville soils, have a natric horizon."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Vimville soils are poorly drained, runoff is very slow, and permeability is slow.  These soils have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 0.5 to 1.0 feet below the surface late during winter and early in spring.  Areas of these soils on terraces flood for brief periods unless protected."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are mainly used as woodlands.  Common trees are water oak, willow oak, sweetgum, and loblolly pine.  Some areas are cleared and used for soybeans, pasture, and hay."
