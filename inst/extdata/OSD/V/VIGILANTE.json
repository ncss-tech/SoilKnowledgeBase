  "REVDATE": "04/2014",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Vigilante series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or slope alluvium deposited over hard fractured shale, siltstone or argillite bedrock. These soils are on alluvial fans, hills and ridges. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
