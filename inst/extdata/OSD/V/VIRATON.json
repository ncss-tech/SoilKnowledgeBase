  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock are more than 60 inches.  Depth to the fragipan is 15 to 33 inches. The content of chert cobbles ranges from 0 to 25 percent above the fragipan, 0 to 35 percent in the fragipan and 0 to 70 percent below the fragipan.  The content of chert gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the A and upper Bt horizons, 0 to 35 percent for the lower Bt horizon, 25 to 70 percent in the 2Ex and 2Btx horizons, and 0 to 70 percent in the 3Bt horizon.  Reaction above the fragipan is moderately acid to very strongly acid, unless limed, strongly acid to extremely acid within the fragipan, and very strongly acid to neutral below the fragipan.  Noncultivated areas typically have an E horizon.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or gravelly silt loam.\nThe BE or E horizon, if present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or their gravelly analogues.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6.  Chroma typically is 3 to 6, but may be 2 in the lower part just above the fragipan.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam or their gravelly analogues.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has mottles or redoximorphic features with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6.\nThe 2Bx or 2Btx horizon has mixed colors of red, gray, and brown and any one may dominate.  It has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6.  It is gravelly, cobbly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogues of silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have a 2Ex horizon.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Mottles are similar in hue and value to the 2Bt horizon but the chroma ranges from 1 to 6.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, clay or their gravelly to extremely gravelly or cobbly to extremely cobbly analogues."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Viraton soils are on gently sloping and moderately sloping broad ridgetops, foot slopes and strath terraces.  Slope gradients are typically less than 5 percent but range from 1 to 20 percent.  They formed loess and the underlying residuum or colluvium from cherty limestone. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 37 to 45 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F."

Plato soils are in the fine particle size family. Wilderness soils are loamy-skeletal.  Gatewood and Ocie soils are on steeper sideslopes below the Viraton soils.  Plato soils are on higher broader ridgetops above the Viraton soils.  Pomme soils are on similar positions adjacent to Viraton soils on strath terraces. Wilderness soils are on narrow ridgetops below Viraton soils."

Permeability is moderate above the fragipan, very slow in the fragipan and moderately slow below the fragipan.  The saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high above and below the fragipan, and low in the fragipan.  In undisturbed areas, a perched water table has an upper limit of 1.5 to 2.5 feet during December to May in most years."
