Brunzell (T), Holmes, Horrocks, Howcan (T), and Stemilt soils are greater than 40 inches to bedrock.  Hoskin soils have C horizons and color hues in the A and B horizons of 7,5YR or redder.  The Vitale soils have less silt and more sand coarser than very fine sand in the control section, and the rock fragments in the B horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Valmar soils are on mountainsides and have slopes of 20 to 80 percent.  They formed in residuum, alluvium, and colluvium derived from quartzite and other related metasedimentary rocks.  Elevations are 4,500 to 7,000 feet.  Average annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches.  Average annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 70 to 100 days."

Cedarhil soils are on landscapes similar to Valmar but in areas associated with limestone and dolomite.  Camelback, Hades and Moonlight soils are pachic and are on lower concave positions on the slopes where associated with Valmar.  Hondoho and Watercanyon soils are on fan terraces where associated with Valmar soils.  Hondoho soils have calcic horizons.  The Watercanyon soils are coarse-silty, deeper than 60 inches and are calcareous to the surface.  Moonlight soils are coarse-loamy and pachic and are on north and east-facing concave slopes where associated with Valmar soils."
