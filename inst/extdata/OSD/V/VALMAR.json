  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Valmar series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from quartzite and related metasedimentary rocks.  Valmar soils are on mountainsides and ridges and have slopes of 20 to 80 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Cedarhil soils are on landscapes similar to Valmar but in areas associated with limestone and dolomite.  Camelback, Hades and Moonlight soils are pachic and are on lower concave positions on the slopes where associated with Valmar.  Hondoho and Watercanyon soils are on fan terraces where associated with Valmar soils.  Hondoho soils have calcic horizons.  The Watercanyon soils are coarse-silty, deeper than 60 inches and are calcareous to the surface.  Moonlight soils are coarse-loamy and pachic and are on north and east-facing concave slopes where associated with Valmar soils."
