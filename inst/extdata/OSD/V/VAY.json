    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vay soils are on mountains and ridgetops.  They formed in material derived dominantly from granite, gneiss, and schist with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 3,200 to 6,500 feet.  The climate is cold, humid with cool, moist summers and cold, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches, and average annual air temperature is 38 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 30 to 90 days."
