  "STATES": "ID,WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Vay series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils on mountains and ridgetops.  They formed in material derived from granite, gneiss, or schist with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately rapid to rapid in the substratum.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
