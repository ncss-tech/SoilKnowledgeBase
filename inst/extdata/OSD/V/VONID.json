  "OVERVIEW": "The Vonid series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian deposits.  Vonid soils are on interdunes, ridges, interfluves and hills in the Upper Arkansas Valley Rolling Plains MLRA 69.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 inches (300 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is 52 degrees F (11 degrees C).",
