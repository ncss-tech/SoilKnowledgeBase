  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  The surface layer of loess or other silty deposit typically ranges in thickness from 10 to 30 inches.  The thickness and arrangement of the sandy and clayey horizons in the sandstone and shale residuum are extremely variable.  Depth to indurated shale and sandstone ranges from about 42 to 72 inches.  The control section strongly acid to extremely acid.  The C horizon is very strongly acid to slightly acid.  Coarse fragments, which are in the form of pebble size pieces of sandstone, are essentially not present in the solum but range from 0 to 5 percent by volume in the substratum.\nThe Ap or A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It commonly is silt loam, but the range includes loam in the lower part with pedons that have thick E horizons extending into the residuum.\nThe Bg horizon has 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y hue; value of 4 through 6; and chroma of 0 to 2.  It has few to many, faint to prominent mottles of high chroma.  It typically has stratified textures of sand and silty clay and clay, but stratified loam, clay loam, and sandy clay loam are in the range.  The upper part of the control section averages between 18 and 30 percent clay and between 30 and 55 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe Cg horizon has 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y hue; value of 4 through 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  A few low or high chroma mottles, or both, are in some pedons. The upper part of the C horizon has a sand layer greater than 6 inches thick and is typically underlain by stratified fine or medium sand and silty clay or clay, but thin loamy layers are allowed."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Vesper series is the only series in this family.  Other series in closely related series are Elm Lake, Kert, Mahaffey, and Veedum.  Elm Lake soils have sandier upper sola.  Kert soils have argillic horizons, less gray sola, and contain less organic matter in their A horizons.  Mahaffey soils have brown hue, typically silty clay loam or clay loam textures throughout the control section, and are in areas receiving greater than 70 inches of precipitation. Veedum soils have thicker A horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are in drainageways and depressions on uplands underlain by sandstone and shale.  Slopes are concave and range from 0 to 2 percent.  The Vesper soils formed in thin layers of loess or other silty deposit and residuum weathered from interbedded sandstone and shale (Mt. Simon Formation).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 34 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hiles, Kert, and Veedum soils.  The well drained and moderately well drained Hiles, the somewhat poorly drained Kert, and the very poorly or poorly drained Veedum soils are in a drainage sequence with the Vesper soils.  Hiles and Kert soils are on higher-lying, better drained sites.  Veedum soils are on a similar landscape position but usually are wetter and have thick and darker A horizons."

Where adequate drainage has been provided, these soils are cropped to small grain, hay, and corn silage.\nNative vegetation consisted primarily of mixed deciduous and coniferous trees and some sedges. Principal trees were white pine, elm, ash, soft maple, aspen, and some white ash."
