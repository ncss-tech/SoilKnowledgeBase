    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vieja soils are on hilly, erosional desert basins that are frequently associated with badlands.  Slope gradients range from 3 percent to about 30 percent.  The underlying rock is shale.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 10 inches. Rainfall occurs mainly as thunder showers during the summer and fall months.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 72 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 240 to 290 days, and elevation ranges from 2,000 to 4,500 feet."
