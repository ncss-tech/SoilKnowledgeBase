  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Revision of 10/2002 changed the classification from Ashy over loamy, mixed Typic Vitricryands to Ashy over loamy, amorphic over isotic Typic Vitricryands.\nRevision of 10/2012 changes the classification from Ashy over loamy, amorphic over isotic Typic Vitricryands to Ashy over loamy, amorphic over isotic, frigid Typic Udivitrands after an investigation of Vassar across its extent.  Depth class also changed from deep and very deep to deep.  Areas of Vassar that are very deep (primarily in Kootenai County) should be investigated further to determine proper series assignment and parent material (parent material in ID606 is metamorphic).\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Oi, Oe and A horizons)\nCambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 26 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - 2 to 42 inches (A, Bw1, Bw2, 2C1, and part of the 2C2 horizons)\nAndic soil properties - the zone from 2 to 26 inches (A, Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)\nParalithic contact - the zone below 55 inches (2Cr horizon)\nAdditional Data: Laboraory data are available for this series: NSSL pedon ID S08ID057003, Pedon No. 09N0077, from Latah County, Idaho, and NSSL pedon ID S04ID057008, Pedon No. 05N0161 from Latah County, Idaho.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
