  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The fine earth fraction of the particle-size control section is typically loam with about 20 percent clay, but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 85 percent by volume and are dominantly channers.  The soil is usually calcareous throughout, but the surface layer is leached a few inches in some pedons.\nThe A horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Danavore soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Pishkun soils lack a lithic contact within a depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vandamore soils are on wind-swept upland ridges on mountain sides and have slopes of 5 to 65 percent.  They formed in material weathered from fine grained sandstone.  The climate is cool with long winters and cool moist springs.  Elevation ranges from 7,400 to 9,500 feet.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 22 inches.  Much snow is lost from the areas because of wind.  The annual temperature ranges from 38 to 43 degrees F., and the frost-free growing season is less than 75 days."
