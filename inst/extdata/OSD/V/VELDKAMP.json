The clay content of the fine earth fraction of the B2t ranges from 35 to 60 percent. Rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent by volume and are most commonly well rounded and are dominantly 1/8 to 10 inch in diameter.  Reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, color value of 3 through 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has cobbly and very cobbly modifiers.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, color value of 4 through 6, 2 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is dominantly very gravelly and very cobbly clay loam, clay and sandy clay.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y.  It is stratified and most commonly very gravelly and very cobbly sandy clay loam and sandy loams."

The soils formed in very gravelly and cobbly stratified old alluvium derived from sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous rocks.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.  The frost free season is 125 to 142 days."

Flatirons soils have an abrupt increase in clay content from the A to B2t horizons.  The Nederland and Willowman soils have B2t horizons with less than 35 percent clay.  Valmont soils have contrasting substratums."
