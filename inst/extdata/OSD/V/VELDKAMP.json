  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Veldkamp series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in very cobbly and gravelly alluvium derived from a variety of rocks.  Veldkamp soils are on high terraces and pediments and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The clay content of the fine earth fraction of the B2t ranges from 35 to 60 percent. Rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent by volume and are most commonly well rounded and are dominantly 1/8 to 10 inch in diameter.  Reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, color value of 3 through 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has cobbly and very cobbly modifiers.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, color value of 4 through 6, 2 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is dominantly very gravelly and very cobbly clay loam, clay and sandy clay.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y.  It is stratified and most commonly very gravelly and very cobbly sandy clay loam and sandy loams."

The soils formed in very gravelly and cobbly stratified old alluvium derived from sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous rocks.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.  The frost free season is 125 to 142 days."
