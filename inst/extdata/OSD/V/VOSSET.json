  "OVERVIEW": "The Vosset series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived rom mixed igneous rocks.  Vosset soils occur on alluvial fans and have slopes of 4 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
