  "OVERVIEW": "The Vegastorm series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium over lacustrine sediments. Vegastorm soils are on alluvial flats. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
