  "OVERVIEW": "The Vestwells series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils. Vestwells soils that formed in sandy and loamy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. They are on nearly level to very gently sloping plains.  The mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in) and the mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F). Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.",
