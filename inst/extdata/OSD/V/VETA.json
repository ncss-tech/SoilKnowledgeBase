  "OVERVIEW": "The Veta series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Veta soils are on inset fans, alluvial fans, fan remnants, lake plains, and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",

Drinkwater soils have 20 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Finley soils have a sandy 2C horizon at a depth of 50 to 100 cm.  Kiona soils have mainly cobbles in the particle-size control section and a cambic horizon that directly overlies a Bk horizon.  Minat soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section and depth to the base of the cambic horizon is 50 to 76 cm.  Nibbs soils have secondary carbonates within 38 cm and have a lithologic discontinuity within the control section.  Veet soils are moistened intermittently from 10 to 20 days cumulative from June through September and the cambic horizon directly overlies a Bk horizon.  Wifton soils are dominated by stones in the particle-size control section, have identifiable secondary carbonates at depths of 25 to 50 cm, and have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 10 degrees C."
