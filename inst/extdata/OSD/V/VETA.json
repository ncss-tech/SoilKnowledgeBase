Drinkwater soils have 20 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Finley soils have a sandy 2C horizon at a depth of 50 to 100 cm.  Kiona soils have mainly cobbles in the particle-size control section and a cambic horizon that directly overlies a Bk horizon.  Minat soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section and depth to the base of the cambic horizon is 50 to 76 cm.  Nibbs soils have secondary carbonates within 38 cm and have a lithologic discontinuity within the control section.  Veet soils are moistened intermittently from 10 to 20 days cumulative from June through September and the cambic horizon directly overlies a Bk horizon.  Wifton soils are dominated by stones in the particle-size control section, have identifiable secondary carbonates at depths of 25 to 50 cm, and have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 10 degrees C."

Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,220 to 1,830 meters but range down to 732 meters in Idaho.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."
