  "OVERVIEW": "The Voyageurs series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in silty lacustrine sediments overlying water-worked coarse loamy dense till overlying bedrock. These soils are on lacustrine modified bedrock controlled till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 700 millimeters and annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
