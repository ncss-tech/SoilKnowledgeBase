  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to calcareous shale ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Some pedons have a loamy or silty mantle up to 20 inches thick over the clayey residuum. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent clay. Shale fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume. The soil typically is calcareous. Some pedons are noncalcareous.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or the flaggy analogues of these textures. Clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. Average clay content in the control section ranges from 35 to 60 percent. Some pedons have thin, patchy, clay films. Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 6. The texture varies widely due to stratification in the original shale. In some pedons the Cr horizon contains thin beds of siltstone, sandstone, and lignite, and fragments of sandstone and lignite. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Vanmeter soils are on convex side slopes and escarpment-like areas that parallel major streams on uplands. Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent. Vanmeter soils formed in residuum from calcareous clay shale. Some areas have a thin mantle of silty or loamy material over the weathered shale. The geological origin of the mantle is uncertain although it is thought to be loess, till, loess-till mixture, pedisediments, or residuum from interbedded shale and sandstone. Mean annual air temperature is about 48 to 54 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 to 35 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Clinton, Judson, Ladoga, and Nodaway soils. Clinton soils are on the higher elevations on summits of interfluves, do not have weathered calcareous clay shale within the series control section, have ochric epipedons that have matrix value of 4 or more moist or matrix value of 6 or more dry after mixing to a depth of 7 inches, and have an argillic horizon with a clay content of 36 to 42 percent. Judson soils are on the lower elevations on footslopes, do not have weathered calcareous clay shale within the series control section, have a mollic epipedon 32 to 52 inches thick, and have a clay content of 30 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section. Ladoga soils are on the higher elevations on summits of interfluves, do not have weathered calcareous clay shale within the series control section, have ochric epipedons that have matrix value less than 4 moist or matrix value less than 6 dry after mixing to a depth of 7 inches, and have an argillic horizon with a clay content of 36 to 42 percent. Nodaway soils are on the lower elevations in floodplains, do not have weathered calcareous clay shale within the series control section, and have a clay content of 18 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section."
