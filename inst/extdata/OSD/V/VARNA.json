  "OVERVIEW": "The Varna series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on till plains. They formed in up to 46 cm (18 inches) of loess or silty material and in the underlying silty clay loam or clay loam till. Slope ranges from 1 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air\ntemperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",

The thickness of the mollic epipedon commonly ranges from 25 to 41 cm (10 to 16 inches), but can range to 8 inches (20 cm) for the 1/3 solum rule. The depth to carbonates ranges from 61 to 107 cm (24 to 42 inches). The particle-size control section averages between 35 and 50 percent clay. The series control section contains from 5 to 20 percent sand and as much as 10 percent by volume rock fragments throughout.\nThe Ap, A, or AB horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silt loam or loam, but silty clay loam is recognized in eroded or severely eroded pedons. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline depending upon liming practices.\nThe Bt or 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 or 4 in the upper part and 1 to 4 in the lower part. In some pedons the lower part of the Bt or 2Bt horizon has hue of 5Y. Redoximorphic features have chroma that ranges from 1 to 6. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or less commonly clay. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe BC, 2BC, Cd, or 2Cd horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 6. Texture is silty clay loam or clay loam but contains subhorizons of loam or silty clay in some pedons. It averages between 27 and 40 percent clay. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline and commonly contains carbonates. Bulk density of the Cd or 2Cd horizons ranges from 1.7 to 1.9 gm/cc."

These soils formed in calcareous silty clay loam or clay loam till. In many places they have a surface layer of loess or silty material less than 46 cm (18 inches) thick. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 12 degrees C (45 to 53 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 1016 mm (28 to 40 inches), frost-free period ranges from 140 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 165 to 311 meters (541 to 1020 feet) above sea level."

The poorly drained Ashkum soils and somewhat poorly drained Elliott soils form a drainage sequence with Varna soils. Typically, they are on lower parts of the landform and have lower slope gradients. Markham, Morley, and Ozaukee soils are on nearby similar landforms but lack mollic epipedons."
