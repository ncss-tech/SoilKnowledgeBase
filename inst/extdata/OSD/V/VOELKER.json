  "OVERVIEW": "The Voelker series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits and the underlying loamy glaciolacustrine deposits on dissected moraines and till-floored lake plains.  Permeability is rapid in the sandy material except through the ortstein layers where it is moderate or moderately rapid, and moderately slow in the underlying loamy material.  Slopes range from 1 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
