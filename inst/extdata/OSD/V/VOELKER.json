Borgstrom and Paquin soils have redoximorphic features at depths less than 40 inches and a high water table at 2 to 3.5 feet for 1 month or more from November to April.  The Pullup and Wallace soils lack stratification and average more than 85 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section."

Voelker soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial and loamy glaciolacustrine deposits of late Wisconsinan age.  Elevations range from 800 to 1500 feet.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 36 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 43 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from 100 to 130 days."
