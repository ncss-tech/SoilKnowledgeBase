Borgstrom and Paquin soils have redoximorphic features at depths less than 40 inches and a high water table at 2 to 3.5 feet for 1 month or more from November to April.  The Pullup and Wallace soils lack stratification and average more than 85 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section."
