Chugter soils have hue of 5YR or redder in a majority of subhorizon and are calcareous above 40 inches.  Deacon soils are calcareous above 40 inches and contain less than 15 percent rock fragments.  Shirk soils are less than 20 to 40 inches deep. Shore soils occur on the Central High Tablelands (MLRA 72) and are more moist in May and June. Tejana soils derived from volcanic ash and cinders."
