  "OVERVIEW": "The Valle series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium from basalt and pyroclastics.  Valle soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
