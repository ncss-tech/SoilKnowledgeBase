  "OVERVIEW": "The Velma series consists of deep, well drained and moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in glacial till with a mantle of loess as much as 51 cm (20 inches) in thickness.  These soils are on sloping to moderately steep uplands.  Slope gradients range from 4 to 20 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 inches).",

Atkinson, and Joslin soils contain more clay in the lower part of the solum.  Burchard soils contain free carbonates within a depth of 76 cm (30 inches).  Cokato and Reedslake soils are moderately acid to neutral in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Cresco soils have grayish colors on the faces of peds on the B horizons. Cresco soils typically contain more sand in the upper part of the solum and have gray colors with chroma 0 or 1 in the matrix and on the faces of the peds in the lower part of the solum. Durand, Hitt, and Winnebago soils have redder colors with hue of 5YR in some part of the subsoil.  Friesland, Moingona, Plattville, Shelby, and Symerton soils are not strongly acid in any part.  In addition, Friesland and Symerton soils contain less sand in the lower part of the solum, and Shelby soils contain a higher content of smectitic clay. Griswold, and Ringwood soils have thinner sola. Keosauqua soils do not have carbonates in the lower third of the series control section. Kishwaukee soils have less than 5 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section.  Jasper soils contain less clay in the lower part of the solum and formed in stratified sediments. Marbletown, Rockton, and Sibleyville soils have bedrock within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Morrill soils typically have, in the B horizon, hue of 5YR, and lack hue of 10YR or yellower. Nuxmaruhanixete soils do not have carbonates in the series control section. Parmod soils are less than 102 cm (40 inches) to the base of the soil development. Penfield soils have more than 45 percent sand in the lower part of the series.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Velma soils are on sloping to moderately steep side slopes of drainageways on dissected loess-covered till plains.  Slope gradients range from 4 to 20 percent.  Velma soils formed in glacial till, typically of Illinoian age, with a mantle of loess less than 51 cm (20 inches) in thickness on many pedons.  They are downslope from the Sangamon paleosol that formed in the upper part of  the Illinoian till.  Mean annual temperature varies from 10.0 to 12.2 degrees C (50 to 54 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation varies from 813 to 965 mm (32 to 38 inches)."

The well drained or moderately well drained Assumption soils and the somewhat poorly drained Keller soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess and the underlying till and contain a paleosol in the underlying till.  The poorly drained Coatsburg soils formed in thin loess and the underlying till and contain a paleosol in the till.  The well drained Elkhart soils and well drained or moderately well drained Tama soils formed entirely in loess.  In addition, Elkhart soils contain free carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).  The moderately well drained Harrison soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess and in the uderlying silty or loamy materials."
