    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSolum thickness is 152 to more than 203 cm (60 to more than 80 in).\nSoil Moisture: These soils are in an aquic moisture regime.\nMean annual soil temperature: 22.2 to 23.4 degrees C (72 to 74 degrees F)\nThe soil is calcareous throughout.\nThe 25 to 102 cm (10- to 40-in) control section averages between 60 and 70 percent clay.\nThe soil is saturated to the surface for periods of 4 to 8 months and seldom dries to below field capacity.  Soil salinity ranges from moderate through strong.\nSome pedons have an organic surface horizon less than 10 cm (4 in) thick.\nSome pedons have buried horizons below 102 cm (40 in).\nA horizons:\nHue: 5YR to 10YR\nValue: of 2 or 3\nChroma: 1 to 3.  Most pedons have few to many distinct or prominent iron depletions.\nTexture:  but a thin layer of silty clay is on the surface of some pedons.\nReaction: neutral to strongly alkaline.\nSalinity: moderate or strong.\nB horizon:\nHue: 2.5YR to 7.5YR\nValue: 3 to 5\nChroma: 2 to 8\nReaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline\nSome pedons have thin buried horizons.  The buried horizons have lower chroma and hue.\nIn some pedons, a 2C horizon, that is stratified loamy or sandy materials, is encountered at 152 cm (60 in) or more below the surface."

Similar soils include the Beaumont, Brazoria, Harris, Iberia, Lomalta, Surfside, and Tracosa series.\nBeaumont, Brazoria, Iberia, Lomalta, and Surfside soils: have vertic properties.  In addition, Beaumont, Brazoria, and Iberia soils are non-saline.\nHarris soils: have gray colors throughout, are noncalcareous.\nTracosa soils: have a peraquic moisture regime and are flooded daily by tidal action."

A water table fluctuates from the soil surface to a depth of about 76 cm (30 in).  These soils are occasionally flooded by both fresh and salt water during Gulf storms.  In a few places very high tides cover the soil."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Velasco soils were previously considered as a saline phase of the Roebuck series.  The high chromas in the lower horizons are related to the red parent materials.  The requirements for low chroma is waived on the assumption that the saturated zone is devoid of oxygen and the red colors remain after citrate dithionate extraction.\nClassification changed from Cumulic Haplaquolls to Cumulic Endoaquolls 11/2000 based on typifying pedon description.  Further study and characterization data of the series is needed to verify hydrology and classification.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon:0 to 76 cm (0 to 30 in) (A1g and A2g horizons).\nAquic features: low chroma redox features and reduction.\nCambic horizon: 76 to 203 cm (30 to 80 in) (Bg horizon0\nADDITIONAL DATA:  THD data from a pedon in Brazoria County, Texas (S76TX-039-011).\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
