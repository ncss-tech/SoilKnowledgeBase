  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist and are dry for 70 to 90 consecutive days during the summer, xeric soil moisture regime.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick.  Depth to the very gravelly 2C horizon is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  Organic matter is 2 to 6 percent in the surface and decreases irregularly with depth.  The upper part of the control section has 10 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand, but less than 50 percent fine and coarser sand.\nThe Ap1 horizon has chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Texture is loam or silt loam with 0 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.  It is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Ap2 horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and 1 to 3 dry.  Texture is loam or silt loam with 0 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It has 0 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.\nThe 2C has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry and is sand or loamy sand with 35 to 75 percent rock fragments.  In some pedons, there are mottles between 40 and 60 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Veazie soils are on flood plains broken by old stream channels at elevations of 750 to 4,000 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in stratified alluvium of mixed mineralogy.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 25 inches.  The mean summer temperature is 64 degrees F.  The mean winter temperature is 30 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free period is 50 to 150 days."

Ricco soils are poorly drained and fine textured.  Voats soils have a mollic epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick and are sandy-skeletal."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {

These soils are frequently to occasionally flooded for brief periods during the snow melt and spring runoff; where protected by man made structures flooding is rare."
