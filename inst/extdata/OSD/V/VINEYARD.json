  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 52 degrees F. and average summer temperature is 65 to 70 degrees F.\nThere are mottles at some depth between 20 and 30 inches becoming more numerous and prominent below 30 inches. Depth to water table varies seasonally between 30 and 60 inches. Salinity ranges from nonsaline to strongly saline. The soils are moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3. It is slightly hard to hard dry, and slightly sticky to nonsticky, and slightly plastic wet. The horizon is slightly or moderately calcareous.  The 10 to 40 inch section has value of 6 through 8 dry and 4 through 6 moist. It is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam with less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  This section is slightly hard to hard dry and nonsticky to slightly sticky when wet.\nThe Ck horizon ranges from 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent with the horizon of the highest concentration below a depth of 16 inches. Below 40 inches, the soil may be stratified with textures of sandy loam to silty clay loam. It has value of 6 through 8 and 4 through 6 moist.  Lime content is at least 5 percent less than the overlying Ck horizon."

They formed in mixed sediments from a variety of parent rocks, mainly sedimentary. The climate is dry subbhumid having a mean annual temperature of 49 to 52 degrees F., an average summer temperature of 70 degrees F., and an average precipitation of 14 to 16 inches.  The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."

Timpanogos soils have Bt horizons. Welby soils lack mottles between depths of 20 to 40 inches due to wetness and have less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the control section."
