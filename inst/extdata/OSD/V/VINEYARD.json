  "OVERVIEW": "The Vineyard series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that were formed in mixed lacustrine sediments from mainly from sedimentary rocks.  These soils are on nearly level and gently sloping lake terraces with slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 15 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 52 degrees F. and average summer temperature is 65 to 70 degrees F.\nThere are mottles at some depth between 20 and 30 inches becoming more numerous and prominent below 30 inches. Depth to water table varies seasonally between 30 and 60 inches. Salinity ranges from nonsaline to strongly saline. The soils are moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3. It is slightly hard to hard dry, and slightly sticky to nonsticky, and slightly plastic wet. The horizon is slightly or moderately calcareous.  The 10 to 40 inch section has value of 6 through 8 dry and 4 through 6 moist. It is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam with less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  This section is slightly hard to hard dry and nonsticky to slightly sticky when wet.\nThe Ck horizon ranges from 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent with the horizon of the highest concentration below a depth of 16 inches. Below 40 inches, the soil may be stratified with textures of sandy loam to silty clay loam. It has value of 6 through 8 and 4 through 6 moist.  Lime content is at least 5 percent less than the overlying Ck horizon."

Timpanogos soils have Bt horizons. Welby soils lack mottles between depths of 20 to 40 inches due to wetness and have less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the control section."
