    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum, the mollic epipedon and depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  The mollic epipedon has 0.6 to 4 percent organic carbon content.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 56 to 59 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature ranges from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soil between a depth of 5 and 17 inches or between a depth of 5 inches and bedrock, if depth to bedrock is less than 17 inches, is moist in all parts from November 1 to June 1 and is dry in all parts from July 15 to October 1 in most years.  Base saturation (sum) ranges from 50 to 75 percent throughout.  Reaction is medium or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 5/1, 5/2 or 5/3.  Moist color is 2/1, 2/2, 3/2, or 3/3.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 27 percent.  Gravel content ranges from 2 to 15 percent.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 4/2, 5/2 or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3.  It is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam and may be gravelly.  Clay content ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  Gravel content increases with depth."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vizcaino series occur on coastal mountains and hills that have rounded primary and secondary ridges and deep well defined dissections.  Slopes are 9 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 50 to 1300 feet.  The soils formed in material weathered from sandstone.  The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 55 inches.  Mean January temperature is 48 degrees F., mean July temperature is 57 degrees F., mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 250 to 330 days."

These soils occur on mountains to the east of the Vizcaino soils, are out of the influence of salt laden wind, have conifer vegetation and lack mollic epipedons.  All are more than 20 inches deep.  Abalobadiah soils are moderately deep and Bruhel soils are deep or very deep to a paralithic contact."
