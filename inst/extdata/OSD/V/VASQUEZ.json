  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The umbric epipedon is 7 to 20 inches thick.  The control section is typically sandy loam with clay ranging from 4 to 18 percent.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent by volume, typically more than 15 percent, most of which are stones and boulders.  The control section is strongly to extremely acid.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, chroma of 2 or less, and value of 3 through 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  Usually this horizon has granular or crumb structure but it has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  It is soft or slightly hard.\nThe C1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, chroma of 4 through 6, and value of 5 through 7 dry and 4 through 6 moist.  There are distinct to prominent mottles throughout.\nThe C2 horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR.  Some pedons are gleyed."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vasquez soils are in concave positions or depressions such as drain heads, shallow basins, and cirque basins above timber line, or in seepage areas on steep slopes.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in locally transported strongly acid glacial till, alluvium, or valley fill materials derived principally from gneiss and schist bedrock. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 30 inches, 15 inches of which falls during the months of April through August. A fluctuating water table occur in these soils at most seasons."
