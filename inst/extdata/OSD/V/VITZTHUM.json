  "OVERVIEW": "The Vitzthum series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils on mountains.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from metavolcanic rocks.  Slope ranges from 50 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",
