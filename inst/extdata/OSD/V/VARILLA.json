  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more. Depth to bedrock ranges from 48 to 60 inches or more. The control section averages 5 to 17 percent clay and less than 60 percent silt. Rock fragments, mostly sandstone gravels, cobbles and stones, make up 15 to 75 percent of the solum and 35 to 90 percent of the C horizon. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid throughout, except a few A horizons that range to slightly.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Some pedons have a thin A horizon with value of 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture of the fine-earth is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture of the fine-earth is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe BC horizon and C horizon (where present) has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture of the fine-earth is sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or loam."
