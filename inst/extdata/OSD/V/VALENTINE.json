Typical Pedon and Type Location: moved from Logan County, Nebraska to Cherry County, Nebraska to better represent the sandhills and site has SSL data. Range In Characteristics: C horizon  added lamellae properties for some pedons. Geographic Setting: revised. Geographically Associated Soils: deleted Duda, Simeon, Doger Gannett, Hersh, Ord and Ovina soils as these soils do not occur at the new type location. Added Ipage, Nenzel, and Marlake soils as these soils occur at the new type location.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Samples No. S54-Neb-16-1 and 2; MSL No. 2440-2444 and 2445-2449, as published in Soil Survey Investigations No. 5.\nData is available of typical pedon (Site ID 87NE031100) at Soil Survey Laboratory of the National Soil Survey Center.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
