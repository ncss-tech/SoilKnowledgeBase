    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Soils are moist in winter and spring.  They are warmer than 41 degrees F, from April 1 to November 1, and they are dry within this period after July 1.  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to the hard, firm and brittle layer is 14 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The upper part of the particle-size control section averages 20 to 35 percent clay and 5 to 35 percent gravel.  The lower part averages 0 to 10 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent gravel.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 25 percent gravel.  It is neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It has 20 to 35 percent clay and 5 to 35 percent gravel.  It is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bq horizon is 25 to 80 percent gravel.  This horizon is firm to very firm and brittle, but it lacks a laminar cap and vertical coatings of opal or pendants on rock fragments.  It is gravelly, very gravelly or extremely loamy sand or coarse sand.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons are calcareous.\nThe 2C horizon when present has hue of 10YR, value of 6 dry, 3 moist and chroma of 4 moist and dry.  It is extremely gravelly coarse sand, very gravelly loamy sand.  It has 35 to 70 percent gravel and 2 to 10 percent clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons are calcareous."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in stratified loamy and sandy sediments and alluvium weathered from lava rocks and ash with minor amounts of eolian material.  The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F, average January temperature is 27 to 29 degrees F, and average July temperature is 59 to 61 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."

Ratto soils are on adjacent lava plains and have a clayey argillic horizon and duripan at shallow depths.  Swaler soils are moderately well drained, have abrupt clay increase, and lack a brittle subsoil horizon."
