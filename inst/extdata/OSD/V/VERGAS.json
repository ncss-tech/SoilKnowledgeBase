  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Vergas series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly or loamy alluvium and lake sediments with minor amounts of eolian material.  Vergas soils are on lake terraces, fan terraces and depressions on plateaus and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to the hard, firm and brittle layer is 14 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The upper part of the particle-size control section averages 20 to 35 percent clay and 5 to 35 percent gravel.  The lower part averages 0 to 10 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent gravel.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 25 percent gravel.  It is neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It has 20 to 35 percent clay and 5 to 35 percent gravel.  It is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bq horizon is 25 to 80 percent gravel.  This horizon is firm to very firm and brittle, but it lacks a laminar cap and vertical coatings of opal or pendants on rock fragments.  It is gravelly, very gravelly or extremely loamy sand or coarse sand.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons are calcareous.\nThe 2C horizon when present has hue of 10YR, value of 6 dry, 3 moist and chroma of 4 moist and dry.  It is extremely gravelly coarse sand, very gravelly loamy sand.  It has 35 to 70 percent gravel and 2 to 10 percent clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons are calcareous."

The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F, average January temperature is 27 to 29 degrees F, and average July temperature is 59 to 61 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
