  "OVERVIEW": "The Voltaire series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Voltaire soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, and floodplains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
