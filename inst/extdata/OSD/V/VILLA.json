    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 63 to 65 degrees F. and the soil temperature is never below 47 degrees F.  The soil between depths of 12 and 36 inches is usually dry and is not moist for as long as 60 consecutive days.\nThe Ap horizon, or upper 10 inches of the C1 horizon where present, is pale brown, light brownish gray, very pale brown or light yellowish brown (10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/3, 7/4).  Overblown areas have weak platy structure.  This horizon is slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent with disseminated lime.  It is noncalcareous in some pedons.\nThe C horizon to a depth of 40 inches is similar in color to the surface.  It is loamy sand or sand.  Thin strata of dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist, sandy loam with (1 to 2 mm) bands of organic carbon between plates commonly occur at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Structure is moderate medium or thick platy or is massive.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline and disseminated lime is slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent.  Fine gravel content is 0 to 10 percent.  The lower part of the C horizon below a depth of 40 inches, is sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand or sand.  It is slightly calcareous with disseminated lime; some strata are noncalcareous.  Thin strata (1/4 to 3/8 inch) of dark brown sandy loam are common.  Fine gravel content of 0 to 10 percent may be present below 50 inches.  A few pedons have few to common, fine to medium, faint to distinct dark yellowish brown, or reddish yellow mottles that are deeper than 36 inches."

They formed in alluvium from mixed sources but mainly granitic rock.  The average annual precipitation is 4 to 6 inches, coming mainly as rain in late autumn and winter, though some occasionally fall as snow.  The mean annual temperature is about 61 to 65 degrees F.; the mean the mean January temperature is about 44 degrees F.; and the mean July temperature is about 83 degrees F.  The frost free season is about 200 to 250 days."
