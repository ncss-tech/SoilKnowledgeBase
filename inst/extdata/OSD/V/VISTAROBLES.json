The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about May 15 to about October 31 (about 150 days).  The particle-size control section averages 36 to 50 percent clay and 3 to 25 percent rock fragments, mostly gravel.  Mineralogy is mixed.  A fluctuating, water table can occur from the top of the duripan to 16 inches, (41 cm) below the surface of the soil from November through April.  Rock fragments on the surface range from 0 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Some pedons have BA, Bt, or 2BCt horizons and/or have iron depletions in the 2Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon dry color is 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6, 5/8, 6/4, 10YR 4/4, 5/2 or 5/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4, 4/4, 5YR 3/4 or 10YR 3/4.  Texture is loam, gravelly loam, sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 16 to 26 percent.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 2 percent.  Base saturation by sum of cations ranges from 65 to 75 percent.  Redoximorphic features such as oxidized iron-manganese masses, with dry colors of 7.5YR 5/6, 5/8, 10YR 5/4, 5/8, 6/2, or 7/3 and manganese masses with dry color of N 2/0 occur in this horizon.

Clay content ranges from 40 to 50 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent gravel.  Organic matter ranges from 0.4 to 1.0 percent.  Base saturation by sum of cations ranges from 75 to 85 percent.  Redoximorphic features such as soft oxidized iron masses with dry colors of 7.5YR 4/4 and manganese masses with dry colors of black (N 2.5/0), occur in this horizon.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe 3Bqm horizon dry color is 7.5YR 5/8 or 6/6.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/6 or 5/6. Rock fragments range from 20 to 60 percent gravel and 1 to 15 percent cobbles.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 3C horizon dry color is 10YR 4/6 or 6/4.
