  "REVDATE": "02/2003",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Valco series consists of very shallow or shallow over a Petrocalcic well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy, calcareous sediments.  These nearly level to undulating soils occur on outwash plains and old stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness above the petrocalcic horizon ranges from 8 to 20 inches. Weighted  average coarse fragments in the solum range from a few to about 30 percent by volume and increase with depth.\nThe A horizon has colors of 7.5YR or 10YR value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 3.  Moist values are less than 3.5.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam or clay loam or their gravelly or very gravelly counterparts.  Clay content ranges from about 12 to 35 percent.\nThe upper part of the Bkm horizon is laminar in most pedons.\nThe BCk horizon is weakly cemented caliche or pinkish limy earth of fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam texture."

Cho, Espy, Kimbrough, Mereta, and Queeny soils have average soil temperatures of less than 72 degrees F.  In addition, Cho soils have carbonatic mineralogy and Mereta soils have clayey control sections.  Darl soils lack mollic epipedons.  Olmos soils have loamy-skeletal control sections."

Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The soil formed in loamy calcareous sediments.  The climate is hot and dry subhumid to semiarid.  Average annual precipitation is 20 to 36 inches; annual P-E indices are 25 to about 40; and mean annual temperature is about 70 to 73 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 260 to 295.  Elevation ranges from 150 to 1200 feet."

Darl soils occur on surfaces similar to Valco soils. Olmos soils occur on slightly higher elevations.  Caid, Elindio, Tonio, and Uvalde soils are very deep and occur on slightly lower elevations."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly rangeland.  Some small areas are cultivated with small grain, grain sorghum, and introduced perennial grasses as primary crops.  In climax conditions, dominant grasses include pink pappusgrass, pinhole bluestem, plains bristlegrass, sideoats grama, plains lovegrass, Arizona cottontop, and slim tridens.  Shrubs make up about 5 percent of the plant community and perennial forbs make up about 5 percent. With retrogression, plants such as red grama, threeawn, Hall's panicum, Texas bristlegrass, and fall witchgrass increase or invade.  Brush plants such as mesquite, guajilo, cenizo, condalia, blackbrush, Texas persimmon, guayacan, agarito and pricklypear also increase and invade.  Gray coldenia is a common forb. The woody vegetation is sparse in most places."
