  "OVERVIEW": "The Venusite series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in granitic alluvium. The Venusite soils are on alluvial fans and fan aprons. Slope ranges from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
