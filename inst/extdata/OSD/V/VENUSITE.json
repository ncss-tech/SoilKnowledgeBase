Elevations are 3,200 to 4,000 feet. The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm winters. Most precipitation comes in the winter but in some areas it is sporadic. The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 7 inches. The mean annual temperature is 61 to 66 degrees F. Mean July temperature is about 78 degrees F., and mean January temperature is about 42 degrees F.
