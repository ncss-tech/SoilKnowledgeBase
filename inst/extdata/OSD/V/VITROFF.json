  "OVERVIEW": "The Vitroff series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium or slope alluvium from tuffaceous volcanic bedrock. These soils are on alluvial fans, saddles and sideslopes of mountains. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
