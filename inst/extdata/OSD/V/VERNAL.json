  "OVERVIEW": "The Vernal series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy calcareous materials overlying beds of gravelly or very gravelly loamy sand or sand.  Vernal soils are on terraces and alluvial fans with slopes of 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 67 to 71 degrees F.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material normally ranges from 6 to 30 inches.  Depth to the contrasting 2Bk2 horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 12 to 40 inches.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary carbonate and/or sulfate ranges from 10 to 30 inches but such horizons are not strong enough to qualify as calcic or gypsic horizons.  Exchangeable sodium percentage either remains constant or increases with increasing depth, ranging from 0 to 15 percent in the solum but exceeding 15 percent in the Bk horizon in some pedons.  Subhorizons yellower than 5YR occur in some pedons but in a majority of the solum above the 2Bk horizon has hue of 5YR or redder.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the solum above the 2Bk horizon and range from 35 to 70 percent in the 2Bk horizon.  These are mainly 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 3 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  Subhorizons yellower than 5YR occur in some pedons.  This horizon is typically loam or clay loam but ranges in clay from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 15 to 55 percent, and sand from 20 to 60 percent with less than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.  It ranges from neutral through moderately alkalineThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5YR.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth ranges from about 3 to 14 percent."

Naturita and Tenorio soils have sand and gravel substratums at depths of less than 20 inches.  Yoder soils are noncalcareous to depths of at least 40 inches and have a sand and gravel substratum at depths of less than 20 inches."
