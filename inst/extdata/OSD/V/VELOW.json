    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nThe solum is 40 to more than 60 inches thick. Depth to secondary carbonates ranges from 20 to 36 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, and 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam or loam.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR and 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7, chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam and silicate clay content ranges from 18 to 30 percent.  Reaction ranges from neutral through moderately alkaline and noncalcareous in the upper part to moderately alkaline and calcareous in the lower part.  Concretions, soft masses, and threads of calcium carbonate range from few to common in the Bca horizons.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 50 percent, with less than 40 percent in the control section.\nThe C horizon when encountered is brownish, calcareous loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Some pedons have gravelly layers below a depth of 60 inches."

Austin soils have more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Paloduro soils are dry in the moisture control sections for longer periods.  Stephen soils are less than 20 inches deep and clayey."
