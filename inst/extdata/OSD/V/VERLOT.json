The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is estimated to range from 41 to 43 degrees F.  The particle size control section averages 5 to 25 percent rock fragments.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.  It has weak fine subangular blocky or weak fine granular structure.  This horizon is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  It has weak fine or weak medium subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is strongly acid or medium acid.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 through 6 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  It is loam or silt loam in the upper part and gravelly loam or gravelly sandy loam in the lower part.  This horizon has moderate medium or weak medium subangular blocky structure, or the soil is massive.  It is strongly acid or medium acid.\nThe 2Cd horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It breaks to gravelly loamy sand or gravelly sandy loam.  This horizon has mottles in some pedons."

The soils formed in glacial till and volcanic ash.  The till was derived from a wide variety of rock.  Verlot soils are in a cool marine climate with cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 80 to 100 inches.  The mean January temperature is 26 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 57 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 41 degrees F.  The frost free season is about 90 to 100 days."
