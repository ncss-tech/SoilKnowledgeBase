  "OVERVIEW": "The Verlot series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in glacial till with a mantle of volcanic ash. Verlot soils are on mountain slopes and plateaus and have slopes of 3 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 90 inches and the average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
