Hotcreek soils have duripan that are underlain by bedrock at 20 to 36 cm.  Lapon soils have duripan that are underlain by bedrock between 25 and 100 cm. Littleaille soils have 8 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Melmesa soils have duripan that are underlain by bedrock between 36 and 50 cm.  Deepeek, Oleman, Shinnpeak and Wanapum soils are shallow over a duripan and underlain by stratified alluvium that is 150 cm or more and Oleman soils have duripan at 36 to 50 cm.  Troughs soils have duripan at 36 to 50 cm and underlain by bedrock at 50 to 100 cm."
