  "OVERVIEW": "The Vinini series consists of very shallow and shallow to indurated hardpan, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Vinini soils are on mountains, hills, mesas and plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
