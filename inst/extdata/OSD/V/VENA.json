It has 35 to 60 percent gravel and 5 to 30 percent cobbles.  It is very gravelly loam or fine sandy loam, very cobbly loam, or extremely gravelly loam.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4 moist and dry.

Beausite soils have sandy loam Bs horizons with chroma of 4 and are underlain by an indurated iron-silica cemented conglomerate.  Inskip soils have chroma of 4 in the A and C horizons and have a mean annual soil temperature of about 54 degrees F.  Longdoe, Mayacama, Neuns and Woodin soils are dry for more than 90 consecutive days in the moisture control section.
