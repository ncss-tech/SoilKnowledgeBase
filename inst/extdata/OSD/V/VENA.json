Location description has been copied from Vena OSD version 01/2000. Changed BC horizon to a Bw horizon. Increased maximum mean annual air temperature and frost free days based on new mapping in Willamette National Forest (OR657). Limited fine-earth texture to loam (fine sandy loam had been allowed previously). Fine sandy loam is noted only in the unpublished South Umpqua Area manuscript. Vena in Douglas County (OR649) does not include this texture, neither has it been observed in Willamette National Forest.\n*Classification updated 1/00 from Dystric Xerochrepts to Typic Dystroxerepts based on amendment to Soil Taxonomy."
