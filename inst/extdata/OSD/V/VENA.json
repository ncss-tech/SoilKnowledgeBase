The particle-size control section is loam or fine sandy loam with less than 18 percent clay, 30 to 55 percent gravel and 5 to 30 percent cobbles.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4 moist and dry.  It has 15 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobbles.\nThe AC or Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4 moist and dry.  It has 35 to 60 percent gravel and 5 to 30 percent cobbles.  It is very gravelly loam or fine sandy loam, very cobbly loam, or extremely gravelly loam.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4 moist and dry.

Atring, Clallam and Straight soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact.  Baldhill, Chamate, Farber, Kanid and Terbies soils are over 40 inches deep.  Beausite soils have sandy loam Bs horizons with chroma of 4 and are underlain by an indurated iron-silica cemented conglomerate.  Inskip soils have chroma of 4 in the A and C horizons and have a mean annual soil temperature of about 54 degrees F.  Longdoe, Mayacama, Neuns and Woodin soils are dry for more than 90 consecutive days in the moisture control section.  The Mayacama and Woodin soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 59 degrees F.  Beekman soils have 18 to 30 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

The soils formed in colluvium weathered from acid igneous rock, dominantly rhyolite.  The climate is subhumid with cool wet winters and warm dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches; the mean annual temperature is about 45 to 50 degrees F., the mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F., and the mean January temperature is 25 to 32 degrees F.
