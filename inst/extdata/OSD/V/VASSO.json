    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vasso soils are on convex to linear surfaces of glacial lake plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. They formed in outwash, eolian or glaciolacustrine sandy materials and underlying glaciolacustrine loamy sediments.  Mean annual air temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 28 inches.  The frost-free period is 95 to 125 days.  Elevation above sea level is 1250 to 1400 feet."
