Depth to carbonates is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to loamy sediments is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, sandy loam or loamy very fine sand.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon  has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, fine sand, sand or coarse sand.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vasso soils are on convex to linear surfaces of glacial lake plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. They formed in outwash, eolian or glaciolacustrine sandy materials and underlying glaciolacustrine loamy sediments.  Mean annual air temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 28 inches.  The frost-free period is 95 to 125 days.  Elevation above sea level is 1250 to 1400 feet."
