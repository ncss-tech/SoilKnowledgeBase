    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 55 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature from 60 to 66 degrees F.  The depth to the duripan is 20 to 40 inches.  The depth to secondary lime ranges from 16 to 24 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  In thick argillic horizons the lower part is clay or clay loam in some pedons. It has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure, has thin to moderately thick clay films and is slightly or strongly effervescent.\nThe 2Bk horizon has 0 to 5 percent basaltic gravel.\nThe 2Bkqm has indurated plates or layers, which have weakly cemented soil material between them, but some pedons are massive and indurated in the upper part and weakly to strongly cemented below.\nThe 3Bkq horizon has value of 5 through 8, 4 through 6 moist and chromas of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is stratified loam, sandy loam or loamy sand with 0 to 55 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  It is weakly to strongly cemented. Some pedons have layers of duripans."

The soils formed in lacustrine sediment and alluvium mixed with loess and volcanic ash.  The climate is semiarid and has a mean annual precipitation of 9 to 12 inches; a mean annual air temperature of 45 to 50 degrees F; and a frost-free period of 110 to 170 days."
