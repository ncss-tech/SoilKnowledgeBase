The cracks remain open for more than 90 cumulative days but less the 150 days per year. (Discrepancies between moisture regime of surrounding soils and period of open cracks are under study. The moisture regime of surrounding soils was used for classification until study results are received.)\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nUpdated and revised for the correlation of Ft.
