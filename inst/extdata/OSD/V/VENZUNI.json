  "OVERVIEW": "The Venzuni series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium, fan alluvium, and stream alluvium derived from shale. Venzuni soils are on stream terraces on valley floors and alluvial fans on valley sides. Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
