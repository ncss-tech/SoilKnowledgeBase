The soil moisture control section between the depths of 10 and 30 inches is dry in all parts from about July 10 to October 10 (80 to 100 days).  The soil temperature at 20 inches exceeds 41 degrees F from about March 15 to December 15 (270 days), and exceeds 47 degrees F from about April 15 to November 15.  Base saturation (sum of cations) ranges from 75 to 85 percent in the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 4/4, 10YR 5/4, 5YR 5/4 or 4/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/4, 5YR 3/4 or 10YR 3/4.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon is 7.5YR 5/6, 5/4, 6/4, 5YR 4/4, 5/4, or 10YR 5/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6, or 10YR 3/6.  It is very gravelly sandy clay loam, very gravelly clay loam, extremely gravelly clay loam, very gravelly loam, or extremely gravelly sandy clay loam.  The Bt contains 40 to 70 percent rock fragments, and 25 to 35 percent clay.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid."
