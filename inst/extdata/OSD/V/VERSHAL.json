  "REVDATE": "04/2014",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Vershal series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or residuum from igneous rock or hard sedimentary bedrock.  These soils are on bedrock-floored plains, escarpments and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
