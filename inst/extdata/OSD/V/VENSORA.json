  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to water table ranges from 7 to 30 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 13 to 19 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 39 to 42 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 65 percent sand, and 10 to 25 percent coarse fragments.  Skeletal textures are common within a depth of 40 inches, but they are not coarse enough to meet contrasting criteria.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 5Y, value of 3 or 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry and 1 or 2 moist.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon has hue 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry and 2 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and 1 through 3 moist. Mottles of low and high chroma are common.  Texture is commonly loam or gravelly loam, but the range includes clay loam, sandy clay loam, and gravelly sandy clay loam.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and moist, and chroma of 2 through 6 dry and 1 through 6 moist.  Mottles of low and high chroma are common.  Texture is commonly very gravelly sandy clay loam or very gravelly sandy loam.  Coarse fragments range from 35 to 55 percent total with 30 to 55 percent pebbles and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.   Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline."

Elevation ranges from 7,800 to 9,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches but ranges from 15 to 19 inches.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 40 degrees F.
