    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 46 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 62 to 64 degrees F.  These soils are usually dry but are moist in the winter and spring months.  Solum thickness and depth to the duripan are from 40 to 50 inches.  The argillic horizon is 30 to 46 inches thick.  Depth to secondary carbonates is 32 to 38 inches.  The pH of the upper part of the solum is 6.8 to 7.4, of the lower (calcareous) part is 7.6 to 8.2 and of the duripan is 8.2 to 8.8.  The A1 horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The surface 1- to 3-inch portion is massive or has weak medium or thick platy structure.  The remainder of the A1 horizon has weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky structure.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry and 3 through 5 moist.  It is dominantly sandy clay or clay, and less commonly heavy clay loam and averages 55 to 70 percent gravel, ranging from 40 to 75 percent.  This horizon is massive, or has weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky structure.  It is slightly hard, to very hard, and friable or firm.  The duripan has value of 7 or 8 dry and 6 or 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is extremely hard or very hard and very firm or firm."

Borda and Termo soils have fine-textured argillic horizons with less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Short Creek soils lack an increase of 15 percent or more in clay content at the upper boundary of the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vicu soils are on gently to moderately sloping terraces at elevations of 6,000 to 6,500 feet. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium from rhyodacitic ignimbrites.  The climate is cool, continental.  The mean annual temperature is 44 to 45 degrees  F., mean summer soil temperature is 60 to 62 degrees  F., and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches, with most of it coming as snow."
