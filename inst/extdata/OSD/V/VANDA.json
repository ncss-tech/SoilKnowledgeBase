  "OVERVIEW": "The Vanda series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from semiconsolidated sedimentary bedrock or from glaciolacustrine or glaciofluvial deposits.  These soils are on alluvial fans, lake plains, sedimentary plains, drainageways, and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
