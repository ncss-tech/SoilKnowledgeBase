  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum ranges from 14 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 2 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the upper part of the solum and moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part. The C horizon is moderately alkaline. Depth to free carbonates ranges from 18 to 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 4. The A horizon is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, or silt loam.\nSome pedons have an E horizon which has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. The E horizon is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, or silt loam.\nThe B/E horizon has colors and textures similar to the Bt and E horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 4. It is clay.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 4. It is clay with silt and silty clay varves."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no series in the same family.\nThe Boxford, Broughton, Buxton, Caneadea, Covington, Fulton, Hudson, Livingston, Nappanee, St. Clair, and Suffield series are similar soils in related families. Caneadea, Bulton, Hudson, Nappanee, and St. Clair series have more silt and less than 60 percent clay in the B horizons. Nappanee and St. Clair series are dominated by less well sorted material containing more rock fragments. The Boxford, Buxton and Suffield soils have textures of silt loam in the upper B horizons and do not have argillic horizons. The Covington, Livingston, and Panton soils have distinct or prominent mottles just below the A horizons. The Livingston soils have a mollic epipedon. The Broughton soils lack the light colored ped coatings and interfingering of E horizon into the Bt horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Vergennes soils are nearly level to steep soils on glacial lake plains. They are on broad plains and on the tops and side slopes of hills ridges and knolls. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. The soils formed in calcareous estuarine and glaciolacustrine clays. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 36 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees Fahrenheit. The frost-free season ranges from 130 to 165 days."

The Benson, Elmridge, Farmington, Galoo, Galway, Grenville, Melrose, Nellis, and Windsor soils are associated with Vergennes soils. The Elmridge soils have loamy material over clays. The Melrose soils have sandy or loamy material over clays. The Windsor soils are very deep sands. The Benson, Farmington, Galoo, Galway, Grenville, and Nellis soils developed in loamy till."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Vergennes soil series is a benchmark series and is in the soil series Hall of Fame.\nThis revision reflects new horizon designations and general updating.\nThe horizons and features diagnostic for the typical pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon).\n2. Argillic horizon from 10 to 22 inches (Bt horizon).\n3. Interfingering of albic materials (B/E horizon).\n4. The particle size control section, from 10 to 22 inches, is very fine.\n5. Udic soil moisture regime.\n6. Mesic soil temperature regime.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL laboratory data is available for the typical pedon S85NY031-08 and the following pedons: S58VT-1-5 (SSIR 20), S58VT-1-6 (SSIR 20), S73VT-1-1, S73VT-1-3, S80VT-1-1, S80VT-1-2, and S57NY-16-1\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
