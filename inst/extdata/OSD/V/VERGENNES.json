  "OVERVIEW": "The Vergennes series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on glacial lake plains. They formed in calcareous estuarine and glaciolacustrine clays. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low or moderately high in the mineral solum and moderately low to very low in the substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent.",

Caneadea, Bulton, Hudson, Nappanee, and St. Clair series have more silt and less than 60 percent clay in the B horizons. Nappanee and St. Clair series are dominated by less well sorted material containing more rock fragments. The Boxford, Buxton and Suffield soils have textures of silt loam in the upper B horizons and do not have argillic horizons. The Covington, Livingston, and Panton soils have distinct or prominent mottles just below the A horizons. The Livingston soils have a mollic epipedon. The Broughton soils lack the light colored ped coatings and interfingering of E horizon into the Bt horizons."
