    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 102 to 127 centimeters (40 to 50 inches) in thickness.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 17 degrees C (62.6 degrees F), and the difference between the mean summer and the mean winter temperature is about 5 degrees C (9 degrees F).  The soil between the depths of 25 to 46 centimeters (10 to 18 inches) is moist in all parts of the moisture control section for about 60 to 75 days, from about January to early or mid-March and is dry in all parts from about May or June to about November.  The soil temperature is always above 8 degrees C (47 degrees F).  The moisture regime is ustic bordering aridic.  When dry, the subsoil soil develops cracks that are less than 1 cm wide and are 8 to 15 centimeters (3 to 6 inches) apart at 50 centimeters (20 inches) or more in depth.  The soil contains about 0 to 10 percent ferruginous subrounded hard nodules in the profile.  Some pedons have coatings of organic matter or sand on the faces of the prisms or in the cracks of the Btn horizons.  The soils are neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have finely disseminated calcium carbonate or calcium carbonate is segregated in fine or medium seams, filaments or threads.  Channeled and eroded phases are recognized in the series.\nThe E horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 7/2, or 7/3.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, or 5/3.  Clay content is 8 to 12 percent.  The clay content between the E and the Bt horizons is greater than 25 percent absolute within 1 inch.  ESP ranges from 5 to 10, and the electrical conductivity is less than 2.\nThe Btn horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 6/2, 6/3, 7/2, 7/3; 2.5Y 5/2 or 6/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 2.5Y 3/2 or 4/2.   Clay content is 40 to 60 percent.  ESP ranges from 15 to 40, and the electrical conductivity is 2 to 8.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 6/2, 6/3, or 6/4; 2.5Y 6/2 or 6/4, moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, or 4/4, 2.5Y 4/2, or 4/4.  It is clay and clay loam.  Clay content is 35 to 50 percent.  ESP ranges from 5 to 20, and the electrical conductivity is 2 to 8.\nSome pedons do not have C horizons or have an overwashed layer over the E horizon, or have an A horizon."
