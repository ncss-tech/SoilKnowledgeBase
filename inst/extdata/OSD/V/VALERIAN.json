  "OVERVIEW": "The Valerian series consists of very deep, excessively drained, and rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian deposits of Holocene age. These soils occur on gently sloping to moderately steep hills or dunes. Slope ranges from 1 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 406 mm (16 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 12.2 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

The major tallgrass species are sand bluestem, giant sandreed, little bluestem, and taller dropseed species. The midgrasses are sideoats grama, sand lovegrass, sand paspalum, sand dropseed, blue grama, and perennial threeawns. A large variety of forbs exist but the amount varies greatly from year to year. Woody shrubs consist of sand sagebrush, skunkbush sumac, yucca, and the occasional sand plum thickets. This is a fragile site and is subject to severe wind erosion if not protected by cover. This soil has been correlated to the Sand Hills (R077BY020TX) ecological site in MLRA-77B, 12-17\" PZ."
