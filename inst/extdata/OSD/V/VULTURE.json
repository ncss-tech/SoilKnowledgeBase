  "OVERVIEW": "The Vulture series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till derived from metasedimentary rock. These soils are on ground and lateral moraines. Slopes range from 4 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1,075 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.5 degrees C.",

The vegetation under a forested canopy is dominated by quaking aspen with a multilayered understory that include Saskatoon serviceberry, common snowberry, common cow parsnip, western sweetroot and mountain brome. In warmer locations the vegetation varies and is dominated by the grasses with a diverse understory of forbs.  These grasses are primarily rough fescue, Richardson's needlegrass, and Idaho fescue, and the forbs include old man's whisker and sticky purple geranium."
