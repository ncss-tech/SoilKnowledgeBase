  "OVERVIEW": "The Villsprings series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains, alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
