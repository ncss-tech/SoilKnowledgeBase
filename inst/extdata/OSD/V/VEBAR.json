  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to soft sandstone ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness.  In most pedons the soft sandstone has carbonates.  Some pedons have an accumulation of carbonates at the bottom of the solum or the upper part of the sandstone.  Stony phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is fine sandy loam, but some is sandy loam or loam.  The A horizon ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is fine sandy loam, but some is sandy loam or loam.  The Bw horizon has weak or moderate coarse or medium prismatic structure that parts easily to weak or moderate subangular blocky structure.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the upper part and neutral to moderately alkaline in the lower part.  Some pedons have a Bk or BCk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, fine sand or sandy loam.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon is soft sandstone that crushes to loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam.  It typically is massive.  Thin ledges or concretion-like pipes of hard sandstone are in some pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Baxton, Belain, Bitterroot, Chincap, Hopley, Mott, Relan, Tally, Unaweep, Victor and Weedzunit series.  Baxton soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 60 inches.  Belain, Chincap and Weedzunit soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Bitterroot and Hopley soils are dominantly loam in the series control section.  Hopley, Mott, Tally, Victor and Unaweep soils do not have a paralithic contact within a depth of 40 inches.  In addition, Victor soils have a sandy-skeletal substrata at depths of about 40 inches.  Relan soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder throughout the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vebar soils are on level to very steep uplands.  Slopes are plain or convex.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 65 percent.   The soils formed in residuum weathered from soft calcareous sandstone.  The climate is cool and semiarid.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 34 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 12 to 19 inches.  Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer."

Tally and Parshall soils are on less sloping, concave swales and terraces.  Parshall soils have a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches thick and do not have paralithic beds within a depth of 40 inches.  Amor, Arnegard, Morton, Sen and Shambo soils are on nearby uplands, swales and terraces.  Amor, Arnegard and Shambo soils are fine-loamy and Morton and Sen soils are fine-silty.  Cohagen and Flasher soils are on nearby hilltops and ridges.  They are shallow to paralithic beds.  In addition, Cohagen soils are loamy and Flasher soils are sandy."
