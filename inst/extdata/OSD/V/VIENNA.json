  "OVERVIEW": "The Vienna series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in silty and loamy loess over loamy glacial till on uplands. These soils have moderately slow permeability. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The 10 to 40 inch particle size control section averages between 24 and 35 percent clay. The A and Bw horizons average about 18 percent total sand and contain less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. The 2Bw, 2Bk and 2C horizons average about 27 percent total sand with more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. The thickness of the silty and loamy material ranges between 10 and 20 inches. A 1 to 3 inch pebble line typically is at the contact between the two materials. The pebble line is not in some pedons. The mollic epipedon typically ranges from about 8 to 16 inches in thickness and extends into the Bw horizon of most pedons.\nThe A horizons have value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 and 1.5 or less moist. It typically is silty clay loam, but is silt loam or loam in some pedons. Distinct worm casts range from few to many and comprise less than 50 percent of the material. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4. The Bw horizon typically is silt loam or silty clay loam but is loam in some pedons. Worm casts range from few to many and comprise less than 25 percent of the material. The Bw horizon is slightly acid to neutral. Some pedons have a 2Bw horizon with loam or clay loam textures.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam or clay loam, but can have thin lenses of fine sandy loam material. The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to over 30 percent in the 2Bk horizon. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2BCk and 2C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.

Barnes, Formdale, and Hokans soils have more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the A and Bw horizons and do not have a 1 to 3 inch contact layer of stones or pebbles in the Bw horizon. Byrne and Doland soils have 20 to 30 inches of silty material over loam or clay loam glacial till. Venagro soils do not have glacial till within 40 inches."

The fine textured Badger soils have more than 16 inches of mollic colors, are somewhat poorly drained, and are on lower parts of the landscape. The Barnes soils are on nearby till plains. Buse soils typically are on steeper landscapes and have carbonate at or near the surface. Brookings and Lismore soils have a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches thick and are in swales and shallow drainageways. The fine-silty Hidewood soils are poorly drained and are on lower parts of the landscapes. Kranzburg and Poinsett soils are fine-silty and are on landscapes similar to Vienna. McIntosh soils have a calcic horizon within 16 inches of the surface and are on footslopes."

In years with normal rainfall, saturation typically does not occur for periods of 1 month or more in the profile."
