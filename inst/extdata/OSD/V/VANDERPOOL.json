  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges is more than 80 inches.  Calcium carbonate equivalent in the 10 to 40 inch control section ranges from 40 to 70 percent.   Snail shell fragments are in all horizons.  Films and threads of calcium carbonate are evident in all horizons below the Ap horizon and increase with depth.  The calcium carbonate filaments are commonly seen when dry but are not identifiable when moist or the soil contains less than 5 percent identifiable secondary calcium carbonates.  The total clay content ranges from 20 to 40 percent with silicate clay ranging from 18 to 35 percent and carbonate clay from 2 to 15 percent.  Siliceous and limestone pebble content ranges from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe A horizon has color with 10YR hue, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam or clay loam.\nThe Bk horizons have color with 7.5YR or 10YR hue, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam or clay loam.  In some pedons below 40 inches contains up to 50 percent by volume of limestone pebbles and calcium carbonate concretions."

Eckrant, Mailtrail, and Real soils are shallow and are on higher positions in the landscape.  Rio Frio soils have ochric epipedons and are on similar positions to the Vanderpool soils.  Oakalla and Dev soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick, and are on flood plains on lower positions in the landscape.  Nuvalde soils are on similar positons and have a fine-silty particle size class."
