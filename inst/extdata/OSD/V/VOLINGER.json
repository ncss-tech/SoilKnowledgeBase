Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches and includes part of argillic horizon.

The particle-size control section averages 27 to 33 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Organic matter is estimated to range from 2 to 3 percent in the Ap horizon.  Depth to secondary carbonates is 43 to 60 inches.\nThe A and A2 horizons are loam or silt loam.\nThe AB horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.
