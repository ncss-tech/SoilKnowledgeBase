  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 47 to 54 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 90 to 100 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches and includes part of argillic horizon.  The upper 12 to 19 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 0.7 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 27 to 33 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Organic matter is estimated to range from 2 to 3 percent in the Ap horizon.  Depth to secondary carbonates is 43 to 60 inches.\nThe A and A2 horizons are loam or silt loam.\nThe AB horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.  It is a loam or silt loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry. It is a clay loam or silty clay loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bwb horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry.  It is a loam or silt loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Btb horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is a loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  The 2Btb horizon is absent in some pedons.\nThe 2Btk horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is a loam, silt loam or silty clay loam."

Elevations are 2,400 to 2,800 feet. These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches. Average January temperature is about 25 degrees F. and average July temperature is about 69 degrees F.  Average annual temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 120 to 140 days."
