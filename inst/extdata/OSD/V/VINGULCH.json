    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F. These soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The upper part of the solum has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.60 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic ash content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  Depth to the loamy-skeletal material is 14 to 36 inches.  Depth to hard bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The lower part of the particle-size control section has less than 18 percent clay throughout or in any part.\nThe C horizon has value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist. This is assumed to be a relatively fresh deposit of Glacier Peak ash.\nThe 2A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist. The texture is ashy sandy loam or ashy coarse sandy loam. It may be paragravelly. There is 0 to 20 percent pumice.\nThe 2Bw horizons have value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist. The texture is ashy sandy loam or ashy coarse sandy loam. It may be paragravelly. There is 5 to 30 percent pumice.\nThe 3C horizon has value of 6 to 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. The texture is very gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly loamy coarse sand, very gravelly coarse sandy loam, or very gravelly sandy loam. It has 30 to 55 percent gravel, and 0 to 15 percent cobbles."

Brannon, Crackler, Farway and Kellerbutte soils are over 40 inches deep to a root-limiting layer.  Capoose soils lack the pumice paragravel fragments in the upper part of the particle-size control section.  Elbowlake, Natapoc and Nevine soils have a densic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Olot and Rouen soils have 25 to 35 percent clay in the lower part of the particle-size control section with textures of loam, clay loam, silt loam or silty clay loam."

Slopes are 35 to 65 percent. Elevation is 2,500 to 5,300 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 20 to 25 inches. The average January temperature ranges from 22 to 26 degrees F, the average July temperature ranges from 62 to 67 degrees F, and the average annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.
