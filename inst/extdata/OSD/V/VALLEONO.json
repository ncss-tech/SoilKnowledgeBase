  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Usually a thin C horizon occurs between the base of the solum and the top of the contrasting substratum but such horizons are absent in some pedons. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick and the solum is 15 to 40 inches thick. Depth to calcareous material ranges from about 10 to 30 inches, and depth to the contrasting sand and gravel substratums ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Organic carbon in the mollic epipedon ranges from about .8 to 2 percent and decreases uniformly with depth. Typically, conductivity is less than 1 millimho throughout the solum but ranges from less than 1 to 16 millimhos.  Usually exchangeable sodium percentage is less than 1 throughout the solum but ranges from less than 1 to 14 percent. Cation exchange capacity ranges from 60 to 80 milliequivalents per 100 grams of clay.  Content of coarse fragments in the solum ranges from 0 to 15 percent, content of coarse fragments in the solum ranges from 0 to 15 percent, content of coarse fragments in the substratum ranges from 35 to 80 percent. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 degrees F. to 46 F.  and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 40 degrees F. to 58 degrees F. The A horizon has hue of l0YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 through 3. It generally has granular or crumb structure but it is subangular blocky in some pedons. This horizon is soft to slightly hard and neutral to slightly alkaline. The Bt horizons have hue of 5YR through 10R, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4. They generally has prismatic structure but has angular blocky structure in some pedons. This horizon is typically clay loam or silty clay loam but clay ranges from 35 to 50 percent, silt from 15 to 50 percent, and sand from 10 to 45 percent. It is neutral to slightly alkaline. The BCk horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R. It contains about 4 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. This horizon is moderately to strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Valleono soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping high terraces and the lower ends of alluvial fans. Slopes usually range from 0 to about 6 percent. These soils formed in moderately thin reddish brown calcareous alluvial fan or terrace materials derived from red bed sandstones and shales and overly thick beds of sand and gravel. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 18 inches with nearly equal amounts of precipitation occurring during each of the months. The mean annual temperature is 39 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 58 degrees F."
