  "OVERVIEW": "The Votaw series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils. These soils formed in sandy alluvium on nearly level to very gently sloping terraces of the Pleistocene age. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 1321 mm (52 in).",
