  "OVERVIEW": "The Vegasglow series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and/or colluvium derived from mixed igneous. The Vegasglow soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 260 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C.",
