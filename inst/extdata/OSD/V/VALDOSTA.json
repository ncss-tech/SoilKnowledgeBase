Total phosphorus ranges from 0.05 to 0.25 percent in all horizons and more than 0.10 percent in some horizons above 80 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in all horizons, except where limed.  The silt plus clay content in the 10 to 40 inch control section ranges from 10 to 25 percent, and commonly is 10 to 18 percent.  Lamellae begin at depths of 60 to 80 inches below the surface.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nSome pedons have few to common light gray or light yellowish brown mottles with uncoated sand grains.  They are loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt4 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Gray or brown mottles range from none to common.  It is loamy sand or sand, most commonly sand.\nThe E/B horizon consists of alternating layers.  The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 6 to 8; and chroma of 1 to 8 that are 5 to 15 cm thick and sand in texture.  The B horizon consists of lamellae with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 and chroma of 6 or 8, are 1 to 3 cm thick and are sandy loam,  loamy sand, or loamy fine sand."

Alaga, Alpin, Cainhoy, Lakeland, and Wando soils lack argillic horizons.  Albany, Blanton, Darco, Wakulla, and Troup soils have loamy Bt horizons.  Arredondo and Gainesville soils have a hyperthermic temperature regime.  Betis soils are dry in the moisture control section more than 75 days.  Eustis soils have more than 10 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon.  Flomaton soils have more than 35 percent pebbles and cobbles in the argillic horizon.  Molena soils have mixed mineralogy.  All competing soils except Arredondo and Gainesville soils have less than 0.10 percent total phosphorous."

They are restricted to the Hawthorn geological formation influenced by the Ocala limestone uplift, and have elevations of about 100 and 200 feet above mean sea level.  They formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments.   Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 67 to 71 degrees F, and the average annual precipitation is about 47 to 55 inches."
