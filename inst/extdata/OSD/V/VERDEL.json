  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum typically is 28 to 40 inches and ranges from 25 to 55 inches.  Free carbonates are usually at depths of 20 to 30 inches, but range from 16 to 35 inches and are typically in the lower B and C horizons.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 36 inches thick and includes part of the B horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  In most pedons this horizon is silty clay, but the range is from silty clay loam to clay.  Reaction is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  The texture of the blocky B horizon centers on silty clay or clay with a clay content of 40 to 50 percent.  Lime concretions and segregations may be present in the lower B horizon in most pedons.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have BC horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is silty clay or clay.  Lime concretions and segregations may be present.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Artesian, Boyd, and Ottumwa are the only other series in this family.  Promise is a similar soil.  Artesian soils have free carbonates above 20 inches and are wetter.  Boyd soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.  Ottumwa soils contain free carbonates within a depth of 8 inches below the surface and have a somewhat drier climate. Promise soils have more than 60 percent clay in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Verdel soils are on nearly level to gently sloping terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 11 percent.  The sediments are clayey alluvium of fine texture derived from residual Pierre shale.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is 46 to 56 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Boyd, Hall, Hord, Lakoma, Lynch, and Promise soils.  Boyd, Lakoma, and Lynch soils occur on uplands above Verdel soils; also, Lakoma and Lynch soils lack mollic epipedons and are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.  Hall and Hord soils have less clay in the control section and occur on terraces and uplands.  Promise soils occur above Verdel soils."
