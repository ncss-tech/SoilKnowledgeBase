  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were previously mapped as mound phases of the Acadia, Crowley, and Wrightsville soils. These soils are reclassified 01/2000 from coarse-silty over clayey, mixed, hyperthermic Glossaquic Hapludalfs to fine, smectitic, hyperthermic Aquic Glossudalfs based on mineralogy of associated soils, pedon descriptions, field notes, and consultation with field staff. Temperature regime changed to thermic 11/2004 based on four year temperature study. Complete characterization and further study of the series is needed. These soils were correlated in southeast Texas until the update of MLRA 152B. The Texla series replaces the Vidrine series in southeast Texas.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 41 cm (0 to 16 in) (Ap and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 41 to 127 cm (16 to 50 in) (Bt/E, Btg1, and Btg2 horizons)\nGlossic horizon: 41 to 48 cm (16 to 19 in) (Bt/E horizon)\nAquic conditions in upper part of argillic horizon in most years.\nADDITIONAL DATA: none\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
