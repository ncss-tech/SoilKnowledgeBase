  "OVERVIEW": "The Venum series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils.  They formed in colluvium from quartzite and other mixed material on mountains and foothills.  They have slopes of 6 to 55 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
