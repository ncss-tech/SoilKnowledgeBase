  "OVERVIEW": "The Vanwyper series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Vanwyper soils are on hills, plateaus, and mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

Clenage soils have a lithologic discontinuity within the argillic horizon and have calcic horizons.  Havingdon soils have 50 to 80 percent angular chert gravel, lack cobbles in the argillic horizon, and have carbonate accumulations along bedrock fractures.  Maderbak soils are moist for 10 to 20 days in the summer. Surgem soils have massive A horizons, abrupt boundaries between A and Bt horizons, 60 to 80 percent rock fragments, and more than 40 percent sand in the argillic horizon. Zephan soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts."
