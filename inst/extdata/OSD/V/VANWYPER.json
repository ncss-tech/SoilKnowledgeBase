Clenage soils have a lithologic discontinuity within the argillic horizon and have calcic horizons.  Havingdon soils have 50 to 80 percent angular chert gravel, lack cobbles in the argillic horizon, and have carbonate accumulations along bedrock fractures.  Maderbak soils are moist for 10 to 20 days in the summer. Surgem soils have massive A horizons, abrupt boundaries between A and Bt horizons, 60 to 80 percent rock fragments, and more than 40 percent sand in the argillic horizon. Zephan soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vanwyper soils are on hills, plateaus and mountains.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed rocks including rhyolite, basalt, tuff, andesite, shale, conglomerate, sandstone, and quartzite.  Slopes are 8 to 70 percent.  Elevations range from 1,465 to 2,170 meters.  The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winter and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."
