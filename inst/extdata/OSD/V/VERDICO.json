  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Verdico soils are on plateaus, hills, strath terraces, and rock pediments.  These soils formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from water-laid tuff and similar tuffaceous sedimentary rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,375 to 2,170.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."
