  "OVERVIEW": "The Verdico series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from water-laid tuff.  Verdico soils are on plateaus, hills, strath terraces, and rock pediments.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
