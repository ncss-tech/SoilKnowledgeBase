  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  Depth of a paralithic contact with dense glacial till ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the solum and the volcanic ash influence is 17 to 28 inches.  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts for 60 to 75 consecutive days within the four months that follow the summer solstice in 6 or more years out of 10.  Clay content in the lower part of the control section is 10 to 15 percent.  The upper part of the control section averages 40 to 50 percent hard rock fragments and 0 to 10 percent soft pebbles.  The lower part of the control section averages 40 to 60 percent rock fragments which include pebbles, channers, and cobbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  Some pedons have an a horizon and lack an A horizon.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam or very gravelly silt loam.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.  Some pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 8 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam or very gravelly sandy loam.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe 2Cd horizon has hue of 2,5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 8 moist, 5 through 8 dry, and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and dry.  It is dense glacial till that breaks to very gravelly loam or very gravelly sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 50 percent."

The Ahl, Ogarty, Pickett, Squires, and Tunnel soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Barnhardt, Blethen, Heisler, and Lyre soils lack a paralithic contact within depths of 60 inches.  Neer soils lack a C horizon and are dry for 75 to 95 consecutive days following summer solstice.  Swinomish soils are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days following summer solstice."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vanzandt soils are on glacially modified slopes and valleys at elevations of 250 to 1,500 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.   These soils formed in volcanic ash and glacial till and slope alluvium and colluvium containing volcanic ash and glacial till.  Summers are warm and dry.  Winters are cool and moist  with intermittent snow cover.   Mean annual precipitation is 45 to 70 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 35 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F.  Mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 140 to 180 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Classification only changed 4/94 because of recent amendments to Soil Taxonomy, except the Cr horizon was changed to Cd and remarks were modified.  This draft reflects a change in classification from medial-skeletal, mesic Andic Xerochrepts to loamy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Typic Haplorthods.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 1 1/2 inches, a cambic horizon from 1 1/2 to 23 inches, andic soil properties from 0 to 23 inches, and a paralithic contact with dense glacial till at 31 inches.  Estimated 15 bar water retention at 12-15 percent based on lab data from Squires pedon #81P529.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
