  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the organic soil layers exceeds 51 inches.  The organic material ranges from 80 percent herbaceous to 80 percent woody material with layers of both common on any given site.  Woody coarse fragments range up to 30 percent in any given layer and average less than 20 percent in the subsurface and bottom tiers.  The reaction is less than 4.5 in 0.01M calcium chloride in all parts of the organic material in the control section and ranges from extremely acid to very strongly acid in water.\nThe surface tier has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It consists of fibric or hemic materials.  Consistence is nonsticky or slightly sticky.\nThe subsurface and bottom tiers have hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  They are massive or have weak thick platy structure.  Consistence is nonsticky or slightly sticky.  In some pedons, thin layers of hemic material are within the lower layers but thickness of hemic material is less than 10 inches and sapric material less than 5 inches."

Chocorua soils consist of dominantly hemic material underlain by sandy material within 51 inches.  Sebago soils consist of dominantly hemic material in the subsurface tier.  Togus soils are underlain by sandy material within 51 inches.  Wonsqueak soils are dominantly sapric material underlain by loamy mineral material within 51 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vassalboro soils are in bogs and kettle holes within till, outwash, and lake plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Vassalboro soils formed in a mixture of herbaceous, woody and sphagnum material.  The climate is humid and cool temperate.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 48 inches, and mean annual air temperature is 38 to 46 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 5 to 1800 feet above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Adams, Brayton, Buxton, Chocorua, Colonel, Colton, Croghan, Dixfield, Marlow, Scantic and Sebago soils.  Adams, Colton, and Croghan are mineral soils on nearby outwash plains and deltas.  Brayton, Colonel, Dixfield, Hermon, and Marlow are mineral soils on nearby glaciated uplands.  Buxton and Scantic are mineral soils on nearby lacustrine or marine plains.  Chocorua and Sebago are organic soils adjacent to the Vassalboro soils in bogs."

Trees are commonly scattered or in small clumps and consist of black spruce, balsam fir, tamarack, eastern white pine, and red maple.  Herbaceous vegetation is mostly cattails, grasses, and sedges."
