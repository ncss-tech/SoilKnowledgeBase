  "OVERVIEW": "The Varysburg series consists of very deep, well drained and moderately well drained soils on dissected lake plains. They are nearly level to steep soils formed in gravelly outwash material and the underlying clayey lacustrine sediments. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the mantle and low to moderately low in the clayey lacustrine material. Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches, mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F., and mean growing season is about 155 days.",
