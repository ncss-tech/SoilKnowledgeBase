  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 35 through 50 inches. Depth to clayey material ranges from 20 through 35 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 10 through 40 percent in the surface horizon, increasing with depth to as much as 65 percent in the upper part of the B horizon and includes 0 through 5 percent cobblestones. There are few or no rock fragments in the 2B and 2C horizons. Unless limed, the reaction of the solum ranges from strongly acid through neutral in the upper part and slightly acid through moderately alkaline in the lower part and 2C horizon. Depth to carbonates is typically 41 inches, but ranges from 35 through 60 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It ranges from sandy loam to silt loam in the fine earth fraction. The Ap or A horizon has weak or moderate fine or medium granular structure and friable or very friable consistence. Thickness of the A horizon ranges from 2 through 5 inches.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 6. It ranges from sandy loamy through silt loam in the fine earth fraction. The BA horizon has weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure and friable or very friable consistence.\nThe B/E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 6 in the B part and value of 5 through 7 and chroma of 2 or 3 in the E part. This horizon is sandy loam, silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction. The B/E horizon has weak or moderate, medium or fine subangular blocky structure and friable or firm consistence.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam in the fine earth fraction. The Bt horizon has weak or moderate, medium or fine subangular blocky structure and friable or firm consistence.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4, and may have few or common redoximorphic features. It is silty clay loam or silty clay with a clay content of between 40 and 55 percent. The 2Bt horizon has moderate or strong, medium through very coarse angular or subangular blocky or medium or coarse prismatic structure and firm or very firm consistence.\nThe 2C horizon colors are similar to those of the 2Bt horizon. The 2C horizon is silty clay, silty clay loam or clay and is commonly varved with silt or silt loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Varysburg soils are nearly level to very steep on dissected lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 through 50 percent. The soils formed in a mantle of glacial outwash gravel over lake sediments high in clay. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 through 40 inches, mean annual air temperature from 45 through 49 degrees F., and mean growing season from 130 through 180 days."

Alton soils occupy deep gravelly outwash areas and lack contrasting clayey B horizons. Canandaigua, Caneadea, Hudson, and Rhinebeck soils formed in deep silty or clayey lacustrine deposits that lack outwash mantles. In addition, Canandaigua, Caneadea, and Rhinebeck soils occupy wetter parts of the landscapes. Chenango, Howard, and Palmyra lack contrasting clayey textures in the lower B and C horizons."
