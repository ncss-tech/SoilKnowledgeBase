  "OVERVIEW": "The Vanson series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from volcanic ash and extrusive igneous rock with a mantle of aerially deposited ash and pumice.  These soils are on mountain slopes and ridgetops.  Slopes range from 5 to 90 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 105 inches and average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from volcanic ash and extrusive igneous rock, including andesite, andesitic flow breccia, and olivine basalt, with a mantle of aerially deposited ash and pumice from Mt. St. Helens.  The layers of tephra in the pedon are typically distinct.  When present, the most easily recognized are the mottled coarse ash and pumice of the 400-year-old layer W and the thin lense of pumice of the 3,500-year-old layer Y.  The climate is characterized by cool dry summers and cold wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 80 to 130 inches, including considerable snowfall. The average annual air temperature is 38 to 40 degrees F.  Growing season (28 degree F) is 90 to 140 days."
