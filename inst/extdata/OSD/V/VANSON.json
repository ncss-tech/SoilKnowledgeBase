The upper 5 to 20 inches of the control section is estimated to have 30 to 60 percent volcanic ash and pumice and less than 35 percent pumice greater than 2mm.  The lower part of the control section averages 35 to 70 percent angular and subangular hard pebbles and cobbles and 30 to 60 percent vitric volcanic ash.  Below the E horizon, soil reaction is strongly acid through neutral.  Some pedons are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact or dense glacial till.\nThe E horizon has value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 8 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Soil reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bs horizons have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6 moist, 5 through 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 8 moist and dry.  Colors are mottled or variegated, especially in horizons containing pumice.  It is ashy sandy loam, gravelly ashy loamy sand, or very gravelly ashy loamy sand.  Pumice fragments average from 5 to 35 percent. Hard pebbles average from 0 to 15 percent.  Shot-like aggregates average from 0 to 10 percent.  It has 15-bar moisture (dry) of 10 to 12 percent (estimated).\nThe 5Bw and 5BC horizons have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It is medial sandy loam or medial loam.  Hard subangular and angular pebbles range from 30 to 55 percent, cobbles from 10 to 30 percent, and stones from 0 to 10 percent.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vanson soils are on mountain backslopes and ridgetops at elevations of 2,800 to 5,000 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 90 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from volcanic ash and extrusive igneous rock, including andesite, andesitic flow breccia, and olivine basalt, with a mantle of aerially deposited ash and pumice from Mt. St. Helens.  The layers of tephra in the pedon are typically distinct.  When present, the most easily recognized are the mottled coarse ash and pumice of the 400-year-old layer W and the thin lense of pumice of the 3,500-year-old layer Y.  The climate is characterized by cool dry summers and cold wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 80 to 130 inches, including considerable snowfall. The average annual air temperature is 38 to 40 degrees F.  Growing season (28 degree F) is 90 to 140 days."

Hoffstadt soils are frigid.  Lonestar soils hae less than 35 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the control section. Stahl soils have an umbric epipedon and are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Swift soils are frigid."
