Butler, Clarinda, Haig, Minnetonka, and Terrabella soils average more than 40 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Carbika, Coatsburg and Lodgepole soils average more than 5 percent sand in the control section. Chancellor and Worthing soils have a mollic epipedon more than 61 centimeters (24 inches) in thickness. Edinburg soils have an albic horizon or noticeable clean silt grains in some subhorizon in the upper one-half of the control section. Fosterburg soils have a concentration of exchangeable sodium in the argillic horizon. Mazaska soils average more than 10 percent sand in the bottom one-forth of the control section. Sacville soils have gravel in the middle and lower parts of the series control section. Sampsel soils have a paralithic contact in the lower part of the series control section. Tainter, Winterset, and Worthing soils average less than 12.2 degrees C. (54 degrees F.) in the temperature control section."

Cowden and Oconee soils do not have mollic epipedons and have albic horizons. Cowden soils are on similar nearby nearly level summits and Oconee soils are nearby on low convex ridges or along drainageways. The moderately well drained Harrison soils and the somewhat poorly drained Herrick and Ipava soils are on convex ridges or along the dissecting drainageways and form a hydrosequence with Virden soils. Piasa soils have a natric horizon and an albic horizon and are on nearly level summits nearby."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the subsoil and substratum. Permeability is moderately slow. In undisturbed areas there is an apparent seasonal high water table within a depth of 31 centimeters (1.0 foot) during November to May in normal years. Some areas are subject to ponding."

The new pedon has a silty clay loam surface layer which is the dominant surface texture for the series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nmollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 58 centimeters (23 inches) - Ap, A, and Btg1 horizons;\nargillic horizon - the zone from 41 to 124 centimeters (16 to 49 inches) -  Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, and Btg4 horizons\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data from the pedology laboratory, University of Illinois, for several pedons are on file at the Illinois state office. Engineering test data from the Illinois Department of Transportation for several pedons are also on file at the Illinois state office.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
