  "OVERVIEW": "The Virden series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in loess on nearly level summits on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 12.2 degrees C. (54 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches).",

The moderately well drained Harrison soils and the somewhat poorly drained Herrick and Ipava soils are on convex ridges or along the dissecting drainageways and form a hydrosequence with Virden soils. Piasa soils have a natric horizon and an albic horizon and are on nearly level summits nearby."
