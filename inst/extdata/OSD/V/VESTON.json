  "OVERVIEW": "The Veston series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils. These soils formed in sandy and loamy alluvial sediments of Holocene age. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 20.5 degrees C (69 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1397 mm (55 in).",
