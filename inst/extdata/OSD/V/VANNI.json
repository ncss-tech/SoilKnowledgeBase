  "OVERVIEW": "The Vanni series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in colluvium derived mainly from limestone, sandstone, and some shale.  These soils are on foothills and have slopes of 10 to 60 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is 40 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and the depth to the calcic horizon typically is about 13 inches but ranges from 7 to 22 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 13 inches thick and moderately or strongly calcareous.  The 10 to 40 inch depths averages 40 to 60 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  The mean annual soil temperature is 37 to 44 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F.  The soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days during the summer months.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 dry, 3 moist and chroma of 3 to 4 dry, 2 to 3 moist.  It commonly is loam and less commonly very stony loam.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 50 percent, with 0 to 15 percent as gravel, 0 to 20 percent as cobble and 0 to 10 percent as stone.  The A horizon is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry, 2 to 4 moist.  It commonly is loam and less commonly silt loam or gravelly loam with 0 to 30 percent gravel.  The B2 horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline and strongly or very strongly calcareous.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry, 3 to 5 moist.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 25 percent with 0 to 25 percent as gravel and 0 to 5 percent as cobble.  The Cca horizon is moderately to very strongly alkaline and very strongly calcareous."
