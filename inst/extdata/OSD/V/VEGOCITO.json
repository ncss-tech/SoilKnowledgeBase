  "OVERVIEW": "The Vegocito series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly or moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium or slope alluvium derived from stream deposits formed on Cretaceous bedrock plateau. Vegocito soils occur along stream terraces within plateau river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 410 mm and mean annual soil temperature is about 11.7 degrees C.",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Vegocito soils occur on lower stream terraces of plateau river valleys and formed from floodplain alluvial deposits with a fining-upward sequence and some minor amount of loess deposits at the surface. Most of these terrace positions are on landforms old enough to have a developed argillic horizon, but young enough to still have a stratified layer within 200 cm depth that includes sandy or gravelly alluvial materials. Unlike floodplains, these soils are not naturally subirrigated. These terraces can often be identified by their accessibility to flood irrigation ditch networks, whereas older stream terraces are not (this is a guide, not a rule).\nSlope range: from 0 to 3 percent but can be as high as 8 percent along terrace risers.\nMean annual precipitation: from 381 to 457 mm (15 to 18 inches)\nMean annual soil temperature from 9.4 to 14.4 degrees C (49 to 58 degrees F)\nMean annual air temperature: from 8.3 to 12.8 degrees C (47 to 57 degrees F.)\nThe frost-free season: from 130 to 175 days\nElevation: from 1676 to 2286 m (5,500 to 7,500 feet)"

Water table can be present in stratified zone below 100 cm in some terraces (younger-lower). Also, varied amounts of saturation can be induced in some horizons, usually above or below the contact with coarser stratified layers, from flood irrigation waters."
