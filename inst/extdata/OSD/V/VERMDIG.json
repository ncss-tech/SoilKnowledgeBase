  "OVERVIEW": "The Vermdig series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from andesite, tuff-breccia, and tuff.  Vermdig soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4.4 degrees C.",

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 33 cm (A, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 5 to 152 (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and Bt5 horizons).\nAquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation and reduction in horizons between 99 and 152 cm in normal years (Bt4 and Bt5 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 5 to 55 (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons and part of the Bt3 horizon).\nThe revision of October 2003 updated the taxonomic class from Fine-loamy, isotic Aquic Argicryolls.  The isotic mineralogy class was based solely on the field determined values for sodium fluoride pH.  Laboratory data on 15 bar water to clay ratio does not exist to verify the isotic mineralogy class."
