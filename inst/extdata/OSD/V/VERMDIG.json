Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 2,290 to 2,595 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 410 to 610 mm, the mean annual temperature is 2.8 to 5.6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."

The isotic mineralogy class was based solely on the field determined values for sodium fluoride pH.  Laboratory data on 15 bar water to clay ratio does not exist to verify the isotic mineralogy class.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
