The percent of fine sand or coarser is less than 15 percent, typically about 5 percent.  Disseminated or segregated lime occurs at a depth of 20 or more inches.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3 or 7.5YR 5/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3 or 7.5YR 3/2.  The organic matter ranges from 1 to 2 percent.  It is silty clay loam or loam.\nThe Bw and Bk horizon has color of 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 4/3; 7.5YR 6/4 or 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/3, 3/2, 3/3, 3/4; or 7.5YR 4/4.  It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Bqkm horizon is strongly cemented to indurated in the laminar capping and strongly cemented in the underlying material.  It has dry color of 10YR 7/3, 7/2, 6/4, 6/3, 5/3; 7.5YR 6/6, 6/4, 5/6 or 5/4.  The primary cementing agent is silica and contains accessory cementing elements of iron and calcium carbonate."
