  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Vayas series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils on nearly level river floodplains of the Semiarid Coastal Plains MLRA.  They formed in fine-textured alluvial deposits of mixed origin.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.",
