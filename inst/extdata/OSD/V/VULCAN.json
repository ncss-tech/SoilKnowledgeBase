  "OVERVIEW": "The Vulcan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in very stony materials weathered from highly fractured rhyolite or similar bedrock on gently to steeply sloping mesa tops and sides. Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent or more.  Mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degrees C.",
