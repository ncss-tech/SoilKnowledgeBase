  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thin A1 horizons or C horizons occur in some pedons.  These soils are noncalcareous throughout.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent in all subhorizons of the argillic horizon.  Depth to the fragmental IIC horizons ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the top of the argillic horizon is less than 24 inches, and depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 17 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 75 percent in a major part of the solum and any C horizon and are mainly 10 to 40 inches in diameter.  The solum ranges from medium acid through mildly alkaline.  The mean annual soil temperature is 38 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 46 degrees F., with an 0 horizon 4 inches thick.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically very stony or extremely stony clay loam, clay, or sandy clay and the fine earth fraction has 35 to 50 percent clay, 5 to 40 percent silt, and 15 to 55 percent sand with more than 15 percent being fine or coarser sand."

The soils formed in very stony parent materials weathered from highly fractured rhyolite or similar bedrock.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 20 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the spring and summer. The mean annual temperature is 34 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 47 degrees F."
