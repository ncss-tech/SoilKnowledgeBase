  "OVERVIEW": "The Valera series consists of soils that are moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon underlain by indurated limestone bedrock. These well drained, moderately slowly pearmeable soils formed in clayey slope alluvium derived from limestone of Cretaceous age. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils occur on footslopes of hillslopes on dissected plateaus. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm (24 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (65 degrees F).",

The climax plant community is a tall grass prairie.  The dominant grass is little bluestem. Other plants include sideoats grama, vine mesquite, yellow Indiangrass, big bluestem, Canada wildrye, live oak, silver bluestem, Texas wintergrass, cane bluestem, hairy wedelia, Texas cupgrass, tall dropseed, and plains lovegrass.  The dominant forbs include Maximilian sunflower, Engelmann daisy, and bushsunflower. The woody plants include elm, live oak, hackberry, bumelia, green briar and elbowbush. With heavy stocking rates, the site could potentially deteriorate to a plant population of tumblegrass, hairy tridens, Texas grama, red threeawn, western ragweed, broomweed, prairie coneflower, and Ashe juniper."
