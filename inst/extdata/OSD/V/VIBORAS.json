  "REVDATE": "11/2010",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Viboras series consists of moderately deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, sodic clayey residuum weathered from siltstone and shale. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on valley floors and valley sides.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 533 mm (21 in).",

The native vegetation in excellent condition is composed of 90 percent grasses, 5 percent woody plants, and 5 percent forbs. In excellent\ncondition, mid grasses such as twoflower trichloris, Arizona cottontop, plains bristlegrass, pink pappusgrass, and alkali sacaton dominate; mesquite, guayacan, fourwing saltbush, and lotebush are dominant woody plants; the major forb is velvet bundleflower. As retrogression occurs, woody plants increase in density and curlymesquite increases or invades. Other plants that increase or invade the site are Texas varilla, cacti, and screwbean mesquite. The ecological site is Saline Clay 18-25 PZ (R083BY432TX)."
