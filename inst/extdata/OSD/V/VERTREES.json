  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness and depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid to a depth of about 50 inches, and from very strongly acid to neutral below 50 inches.  Rock fragments of chert or channers of siltstone range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in the A and BE horizons, 0 to 25 percent by volume in individual Bt horizons to a depth of about 50 inches. The weighted average of coarse fragments is less than 15 percent.  Below 50 inches, chert and channers of siltstone range from 0 to 35 percent by volume.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. The A horizon ranges from 1 to 6 inches thick and has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam and rarely loam. Severely eroded areas have texture of silty clay loam. (A horizons range from 1 to 9 inches thick)\nThe BA or BE horizon when present has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, and their gravelly modifiers. (BA and BE horizons range from 0 to 7 inches thick)\nThe Bt horizon, in the upper part, has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 to 8; and in some pedons is mottled in shades of brown and red.  The Bt horizon in the middle and lower parts has hue of 7.5YR to 10R, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 6 to 8 and has few to common mottles in shades of brown, red, or yellow and in some pedons below a depth of 30 inches has shades of gray.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  Some pedons have thin layers of silty clay loam in the upper part of the Bt horizon.\nSome pedons can have BC horizons below a depth of about 50 inches, parts of which have some platy or relic shale structure.  Many pedons have small black or very dark brown manganese oxide concretions, or black manganese stains as ped coating, commonly in the lower part of the solum."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Baxter, Maury, Shenval, and Springwood series in the same family.  Baxter soils have a weighted average of 15 to 35 percent chert in the control section.  Maury soils lack the mottles in the middle and lower Bt horizon.  Shenval soils formed in older alluvium and do not have chert fragments in the solum. Springwood formed in calcareous conglomerate in the Triassic Basin of the Piedmont."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in residuum from limestone interbedded with siltstone and shale.  Near the type location the mean annual temperature is 56.6 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 51.2 inches."
