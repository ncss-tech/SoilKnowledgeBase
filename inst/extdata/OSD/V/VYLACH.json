  "OVERVIEW": "The Vylach series consists of very shallow and shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Vylach soils are on pediments.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",

The Vylach soils as mapped in the Surprise Valley-Home Camp Area, California-Nevada are ashy and glassy and will be correlated to another series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 13 cm (E and A horizons).\nAlbic horizon - The zone from the soil surface to 5 cm (E horizon).\nAbrupt textural change - The abrupt clay increase of more than 15 percent at 13 cm (between the A and Bt horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 13 to 30 cm (Bt horizon).\nDuripan - The zone from 30 to 69 cm (Bqm and Bqkm horizons).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 69 cm to underlying soft bedrock (2Cr layer).\nParticle size control section - The zone from the soil surface to 30 cm (E, A, and Bt horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
