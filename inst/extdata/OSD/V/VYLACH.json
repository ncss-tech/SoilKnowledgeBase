Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,610 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 10 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  The revision of 06/2000 moved the series type location from Washoe County, Nevada to a more representative area in Lyon County, Nevada.  The Vylach soils as mapped in the Surprise Valley-Home Camp Area, California-Nevada are ashy and glassy and will be correlated to another series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 13 cm (E and A horizons).\nAlbic horizon - The zone from the soil surface to 5 cm (E horizon).\nAbrupt textural change - The abrupt clay increase of more than 15 percent at 13 cm (between the A and Bt horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 13 to 30 cm (Bt horizon).\nDuripan - The zone from 30 to 69 cm (Bqm and Bqkm horizons).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 69 cm to underlying soft bedrock (2Cr layer).\nParticle size control section - The zone from the soil surface to 30 cm (E, A, and Bt horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
