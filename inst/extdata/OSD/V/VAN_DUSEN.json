Banning soils do not have a designated family activity class and are somewhat poorly drained with a high water table at a depth of 1 to 3 feet. Coolbrith soils are somewhat poorly drained with a high water table at a depth of 25 to 40 inches. Deadpan soils are not currently in the database and cannot be competed.  Dotta and Drews soils have less than 15 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the argillic horizon. Gorman soils have a mean annual soil temperature of about 57 degrees F. and are strongly acid in the lower Bt and C horizons. Harriman soils have considerable influence from diatomaceous material, are dry 80 to 120 days following the summer solstice and typically have a paralithic contact (2Crk) at 40 to 60 inches. Haysum soils have an average annual soil temperature of 53 to 59 degrees F. Lonkey soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches and are dry 120 to 130 days following the summer solstice. Pumphouse soils have less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the particle-size control section. Piercepark soils have an aridic bordering on xeric soil moisture regime. Rankor soils have an average annual soil temperature of 52 to 58 degrees F., are dry 140 to 160 consecutive days, and are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Robinette soils have basalt bedrock at 40 to 60 inches and more than 60 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the argillic (2Bt) horizon. Starboard soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact and have a MAST of 54 to 59 degrees F.  Supan soils are 30 to 48 inches deep to a lithic contact. Waha soils have basalt bedrock at 20 to 40 inches and silt loam or silty clay loam textures in the upper argillic (Bt) horizon. Wapinita soils have basalt bedrock at 40 to 60 inches. Yaxon soils have hard nodules in the Bt horizon, lack micaceous material in and below the argillic horizon, and are dry for 90 to 120 consecutive days."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Van Dusen soils are mainly on north-facing hill backslopes and gulch slopes at elevations of 2,400 to 5,000 feet. These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from mixed lacustrine sediments. Slopes dominantly range from 30 to 75 percent, but range down to 2 percent in one mapping unit on terraces in Elmore County, Idaho. Stony phases are below ledges of rock outcrop. The average annual precipitation is 12 to 20 inches. The average annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 145 days."
