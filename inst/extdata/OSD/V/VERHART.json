  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The average annual soil temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.  The average summer soil temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 70 percent rock fragments and 3 to 8 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has values of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has values of 3 or 4 moist.  It is gravelly ashy sandy loam, very gravelly ashy sandy loam or very cobbly ashy sandy loam.  It has 25 to 40 percent pebbles, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.\nThe 2C horizon has values of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, very cobbly sandy loam, or extremely gravelly sandy loam.  It has 35 to 45 percent pebbles, 5 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Verhart soils are on upper backslopes, shoulders and ridges of mountains usually with southerly aspects.  Elevations range from 4,800 to 6,600 feet.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from sedimentary rock with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 35 inches. Average January temperature ranges from 18 to 22  degrees F.; Average July temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F.; and the average annual air temperature is about 37 to 42 degrees F.  The frost free season is 60 to 90 days."

The Banker soils are on shoulders, ridges and backslopes with northerly aspects and are shallow.   Gatewall soils are on backslopes, are very deep and have a volcanic ash mantle 7 to 14 inches thick."
