  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Verhart series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from sedimentary rock with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  These soils are on upper backslopes, shoulders and ridges of mountains usually with southerly aspects.  Slopes are 35 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 70 percent rock fragments and 3 to 8 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has values of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has values of 3 or 4 moist.  It is gravelly ashy sandy loam, very gravelly ashy sandy loam or very cobbly ashy sandy loam.  It has 25 to 40 percent pebbles, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.\nThe 2C horizon has values of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, very cobbly sandy loam, or extremely gravelly sandy loam.  It has 35 to 45 percent pebbles, 5 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones."
