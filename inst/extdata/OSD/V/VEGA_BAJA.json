  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 32 to 70 inches.  Thickness of the argillic horizon varies from 24 to 46 inches.  These soils are slightly sticky or sticky and plastic.  Base saturation ranges from 40 to 80 percent at 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from neutral to very strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8.  They are clay or silty clay.  Consistence is slightly sticky or sticky and plastic.  Reaction is neutral or very strongly acid.\nThe C horizons are silty clay or clay; sticky and plastic.  Reaction varies from moderately acid to strongly acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series in this family.  The Candelero, Cayagua, Coloso, Corcega and Talante series are similar soils in related families.  The Candelero soils have coarser textured profiles with less than 35 percent clay.  The Cayagua soils are underlain by coarse textured saprolite of granitic rocks within 40 inches of the soil surface.  The Coloso soils lack argillic horizons and have organic matter that does not decrease regularly with depth.  The Corcega and Talante are coarser textured."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Vega Baja soils are nearly level soils on fine textured coastal plains and alluvial fans with slope gradients from 0 to 35 percent.  They formed in coastal plains sediments overlain by alluvial sediments.  The climate is humid tropical.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 76 to 80 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is 77 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Vega Alta, Sabana Seca, Coloso, Bajura and Toa series.  The Vega Alta soils occur at higher elevations in the coastal plain, are well drained and have more than 5 percent plinthite in the B horizon.  The Sabana Seca soils are poorly drained and have plinthite.  The Coloso, Bajura, and Toa soils occur at lower geomorphic positions in the river flood plain.  The Toa and Coloso soils have organic matter that does not decrease regularly with depth and the Bajura soils have horizons with COLE values of more than 0.09."
