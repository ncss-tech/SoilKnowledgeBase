  "OVERVIEW": "The Vanderhoff series consists of moderately deep over soft bedrock,\nwell drained soils on dissected terraces.  They formed in material\nweathered from siltstone or tuff.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes\nare 0 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9\ninches, and the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Moepitz soils have a\nlithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches, hue of 5YR, and are loamy\nvery fine sand to very fine sand.  Piltdown and Sodaspring soils are\ngreater than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Worland soils lack layers of\ncarbonate accumulation and have sandstone bedrock at depths of 20 to 40\ninches."

The soils formed in residuum and colluvium from\nconsolidated siltstone or tuff of the Payette or related Tertiary\nformations.  In places, there may be a minor admixture of loessial\nmaterials in the surface horizon.  Average annual precipitation is 6 to\n11 inches, including 5 to 25 inches of snow, and the average annual air\ntemperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 110 to 160\ndays."
