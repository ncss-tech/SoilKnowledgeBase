Moepitz soils have a\nlithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches, hue of 5YR, and are loamy\nvery fine sand to very fine sand.  Piltdown and Sodaspring soils are\ngreater than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Worland soils lack layers of\ncarbonate accumulation and have sandstone bedrock at depths of 20 to 40\ninches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vanderhoff soils are on dissected lacustrine\nterraces at elevations of 2,000 to 5,500 feet.  The slopes range from 0\nto 60 percent.  The soils formed in residuum and colluvium from\nconsolidated siltstone or tuff of the Payette or related Tertiary\nformations.  In places, there may be a minor admixture of loessial\nmaterials in the surface horizon.  Average annual precipitation is 6 to\n11 inches, including 5 to 25 inches of snow, and the average annual air\ntemperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 110 to 160\ndays."
