  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Unless drained and not irrigated, the upper 20 inches of the soil usually does not become dry.  The mean soil temperature is about 60 degrees to 64 degrees F.  The soils have coarse stratification and the organic matter decreases irregularly with increasing depth.  The 10 to 40 inch section is dominantly silt loam, silty clay loam, or very fine sandy loam.  There is about 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent material coarser than very fine sand.  Except where soil amendments have been used, the soils are noncalcareous or are calcareous only in some pedons below depth of 30 inches.  It has distinct or prominent mottles thoughout.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/1, 7/2, 2.5Y 7/2 or 6/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/4, 4/3, 4/2, 4/1, 3/2, 5/2, 5/3; 2.5Y 4/2 or 3/2.  It is strongly acid to moderately alkaline where soil amendments have been applied.\nThe upper C horizon is 10YR 7/1, 7/2. 6/2; or 5Y 6/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 5/1, 5/2, 4/2; 2.5Y 3/2 or 4/2.  It ranges from fine sandy loam to silty clay loam.  This horizon is slightly alkaline to moderately acid.\nThe lower C horizon is 10YR 7/1, 7/2, 7/3, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 4/1, 3/1; 2.5Y 6/2; 5Y 6/3, 6/4.  Moist colors are 10YR, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 3/1, 3/2; 5Y 4/3, 4/4 and contains distinct or prominent mottles in some part.  It is sandy loam to silty clay loam and is moderately acid to moderately alkaline.  Pedons with 2C or 3C horizons are 10YR 3/1 or 4/1.   Moist color is 10YR 2/1 or 3/1.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.  They are stratified below a depth of 40 inches with mucky silt loam, mucky silty clay loam, muck and mucky peat."
