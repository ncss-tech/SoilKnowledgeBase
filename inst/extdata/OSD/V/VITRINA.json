  "OVERVIEW": "The Vitrina series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist.  Vitrina soils are on toeslopes of eroded fan remnants.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
