Julesburg, Manter, Mainter, Mawer, Torrington, and Truckton soils all average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and the solum.  In addition, Julesburg, Manter, and Mawer soils have sola that do not have a significant amount of medium to very coarse angular granitic sands; Torrington soils are moderately deep to soft bedrock; and Truckton soils are noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches.  Latierra and Mainter soils have an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic."

Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 6,600 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."
