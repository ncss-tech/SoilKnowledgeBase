  "OVERVIEW": "The Viuda series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvial and eolian sediments derived from basalt. Viuda soils are on old basalt lava flows. Slopes are 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
