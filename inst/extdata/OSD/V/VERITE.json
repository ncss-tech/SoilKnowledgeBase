  "STATES": "AZ,NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Verite series consists of shallow or very shallow, well drained soils that formed in eolian material and residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  Verite soils are on summits and shouldsrs of  mesas and plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
