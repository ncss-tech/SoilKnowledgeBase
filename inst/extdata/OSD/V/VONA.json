  "OVERVIEW": "The Vona series consists of very deep, well or somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian or partly wind reworked alluvial materials.  Vona soils are on hills, ridges, plains and uplands and are frequently parallel to major river channels.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 36 centimeters (14 inches) and means annual temperature is about 10 degrees C. (50 degrees F.)",
