Average annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 49 to 53 degrees F.  Depth to a paralithic contact with weathered sandstone that slakes in water is more than 40 inches.  The particle-size control section contains 0 to 30 percent pebble and cobble-size soft sandstone fragments and averages 30 to 60 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  The soil is moderately acid to very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  Soft sandstone pebbles and shot-like aggregates range from 0 to 30 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Rounded and subangular soft sandstone pebbles range from 0 to 30 percent.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 to 8 dry and chroma of 3 to 8 moist and dry.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand.  Soft sandstone fragments range from 0 to 30 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 4 to 8 moist and dry.

Chaix, Elwha, Loper, and Siskiyou soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Dome soils are dry more than 60 consecutive days.  Fidalgo soils are moderately deep to serpentine.  Gilligan soils average 15 to 30 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the particle-size control section and are silt loam or very fine sand in the upper part of the particle-size control section.  Tethrick soils are slightly acid and are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days.  Ulricher soils are dry for 90 to 120 days and have up to 35 percent unweathered rock fragments in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vader soils are on uplands and foothills at elevations of 50 to 1,800 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from thickly-bedded, quartzitic, micaceous fine sandstone with an admixture of volcanic ash in the upper part.  The climate is marine and characterized by cool, dry summers and mild, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 50 to 70 inches.  Average annual temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  Growing season (28 degrees F) is 150 to 225 days."
