  "OVERVIEW": "The Valletta series consists of very deep, well drained soil formed in colluvium from marine basalt and associated volcanic rocks on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 60 to 90 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 110 inches and average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Layers or horizons having 15 bar water values of less than 15 percent are less than 10 inches thick.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 6 dry.  It has 5 to 10 percent organic matter.  It has 2 to 4 cmol/kg of aluminum.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist or dry.  It is extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, extremely gravelly medial loam, or extremely cobbly medial sandy loam.  It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum.  It has 1 to 5 percent organic matter.
