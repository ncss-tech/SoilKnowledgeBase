The particle-control section has andic soil properties with a cumulative thickness of 20 to 40 inches.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cc., acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, 15-bar water retention of 12 to 25 percent for air dried samples, and 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  Layers or horizons having 15 bar water values of less than 15 percent are less than 10 inches thick.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 6 dry.  It has 5 to 10 percent organic matter.  It has 2 to 4 cmol/kg of aluminum.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist or dry.  It is extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, extremely gravelly medial loam, or extremely cobbly medial sandy loam.  It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum.  It has 1 to 5 percent organic matter.
