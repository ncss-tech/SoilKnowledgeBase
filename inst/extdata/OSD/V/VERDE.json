  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are normally noncalcareous throughout but very thin discontinuous calcareous subhorizons occur just above the bedrock in some pedons.  Depth to the lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 12 to 40 inches.  Subhorizons redder than 7.5YR may occur but a major part of the solum and C horizon above the bedrock has hue of 7.5YR or yellower.  Rock fragments range from 0 to about 5 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and in C horizon above the bedrock.  These are mainly 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter.  These soils have fragipan-like horizons forming just above the bedrock that are extremely to very hard when dry and have a brittle consistence when first moistened.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through\n7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  Subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  This horizon is typically loam, clay loam or very fine sandy clay loam but ranges in clay from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 15 to 60 percent, sand from 15 to 60 percent with less than 15 percent being fine or coarser sand. It is neutral or mildly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nThe Cx horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  Subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  Usually this horizon is divided roughly into a polygonal pattern subdivided by greyer and more clayey material between the structured peds.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye)."

Blanding, Buick, Del Rio, Fernando, Keiser, Nepesta, Sharps, Tensleep, Wiley, and Witt soils lack lithic contacts at depths of less than 40 inches.  Roubideau soils have hue of 5YR or redder in a majority of horizons, have more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon and lack fragipan-like characteristics.  Pulpit soils have hue of 5YR or redder in a majority of subhorizons, are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and C horizon and have continuous horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation."

The soils formed in moderately thin, noncalcareous eolian materials containing a high proportion of very fine sand and deposited over hard sandstone.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches with nearly equal precipitation in all months.  Mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F,. and mean summer temperature is 70 degrees F."
