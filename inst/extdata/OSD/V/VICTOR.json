  "OVERVIEW": "The Victor series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in outwash derived from igneous rock. These soils are on outwash fans. Slopes are 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 375 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.",
