Hatspring soils are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the Bt horizon, and are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 105 days.  Immiant soils are loam or clay loam in the upper Bt horizons and are dry for more than 60 days.  Lobitos and Los Gatos soils have average annual soil temperatures warmer  than 50 degrees F.  Mehlhorn soils have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR in the Bt horizon."
