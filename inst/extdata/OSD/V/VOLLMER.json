  "OVERVIEW": "The Vollmer series consists of moderately deep, well drained  soils on hills on plateaus.  They formed in loess and material weathered from basalt.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slope ranges from 3 to 25 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 46 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 22 inches.",
