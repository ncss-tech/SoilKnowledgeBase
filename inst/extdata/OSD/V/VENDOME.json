  "OVERVIEW": "The Vendome series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, knolls and plains.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
