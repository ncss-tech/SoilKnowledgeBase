  "OVERVIEW": "The Volusia series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy till. These soils are on concave to planer landscape positions in glaciated upland areas. A dense fragipan is at a depth of 25 to 56 cm (10 to 22 inches) below the soil surface. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity in the mineral soil above the fragipan is moderately high or high and in the fragipan and substratum it is low to moderately high. Mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C (46 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 1080 mm (42.5 inches).",

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Erie and Wiscoy series. The Erie soils are neutral or mildly alkaline in the lower part of the solum. Wiscoy soils have silty lacustrine materials with less than 5 percent rock fragments within depths of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches).\nRelated series in other families are the Dalton, Fremont, Morris, Norchip, Ontusia, Platea, Scriba, Stissing and Venango soils. Platea and Venango soils have argillic horizons in the fragipan. Dalton soils have coarse-silty particle-size control sections. Fremont soils do not have a fragipan. Morris, Scriba, and Stissing soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections. Norchip and Ontusia soils have frigid temperature regimes."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Volusia soils occupy long uniform slopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. They are on lower valley sides and on broad divides of maturely dissected glaciated plateaus. The Volusia soils developed in firm basal till derived from siltstone, sandstone and brittle shale or slate. They are underlain by lacustrine materials in some areas. Mean annual precipitation typically ranges from 795 to 1725 mm (31 to 68 inches), but in some higher elevations it can range as high as 1790 mm (70 inches). Mean annual temperature typically ranges from 6 to 11 degrees C (43 to 52 degrees F), but in some higher elevations it can range as low as 4 degrees C (39 degrees F). Mean annual frost-free days ranges from 105 to 180 days. These soils generally occur at elevations between 100 and 670 meters (328 and 2,198 feet), but have been mapped as high as 750 meters (2,460 feet) in some areas."

Alden soils are wetter drainage associates on toeslopes and in depressions. Well drained Bath soils and moderately well drained Mardin soils are better drained associates on higher convex landscapes. Chenango and Halsey are on nearby glacial outwash terraces. Chippewa soils are wetter and lower on the landscape. Dalton soils are associated where coarse silty deposits overlie the till. Fremont soils do not have a fragipan. Wiscoy soils have silty lacustrine materials with less than 5 percent rock fragments within depths of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Lordstown soils are common associates that are moderately deep to bedrock."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Volusia is a Hall of Fame series and a benchmark soil. There are plans for future project work to separate out frigid soil areas from areas previously mapped as the mesic Volusia.  After these spatial edits are completed, the Volusia OSD will be edited to remove statements in the Geographic Setting section referring to the higher elevation areas.\nThe separation between Volusia and Venango (Fragiaqualfs) can overlap on the landscape in some places. Future MLRA work refining the difference between the two would be beneficial.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches) (Ap horizon).\n2. Fragipan - the zone from 43 to 137 cm (17 to 54 inches) (Bx horizons).\n3. Aquepts suborder - aquic moisture regime, and matrix or ped faces of 2 chroma or less and redoximorphic features within 51 cm (20 inches) of the soil surface (Eg horizon).\n4. Aeric subgroup - a zone within 76 cm (30 inches) of the surface that has dominant chroma higher than 2 in 40 percent or more of the matrix (Bw horizon).\n5. Udic soil moisture regime (a humid, temperate climate).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
