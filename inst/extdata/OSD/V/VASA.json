  "OVERVIEW": "The Vasa series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in 100 to 200 centimeters of loess and the underlying glacial till. Vasa soils are on interfluves on dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 785 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
