  "OVERVIEW": "The Varelum series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone.  Varelum soils are on foothills and mountain slopes at elevations of 1,000 to 3,000 feet.  Slopes are 3 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

They formed in residuum and colluvium, and slope alluvium from sandstone mixed with some volcanic ash and loess. Elevation is 1,000 to 3,000 feet.  They are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 18 to 28 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is about 69 degrees F.  Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 150 to 185 days.  The growing season at 28 degrees F is 190 to 210 days."
