  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Varelum soils are on terraces, footslopes, sideslopes, and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 3 to 65 percent.  They formed in residuum and colluvium, and slope alluvium from sandstone mixed with some volcanic ash and loess. Elevation is 1,000 to 3,000 feet.  They are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 18 to 28 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is about 69 degrees F.  Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 150 to 185 days.  The growing season at 28 degrees F is 190 to 210 days."
