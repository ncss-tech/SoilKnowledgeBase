  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vickery soils are on level to rolling dissected very high terraces, calderas, buttes, and plains.  Elevations range form 2,000 to 5,100 feet.  Slopes are commonly less than 5 percent and range from 0 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and alluvium from igneous rocks and very minor amounts of volcanic ash overlying medium to coarse textured alluvial material.  The climate is semiarid and summers are dry.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, including 1 to 3 feet of snow.  The average annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 160 days."
