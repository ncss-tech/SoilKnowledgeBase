  "OVERVIEW": "The Vickery series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in loess over alluvium from igneous rock and volcanic ash.  Vickery soils are on dissected terraces, calderas, buttes, and plains.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Slopes are commonly less than 5 percent and range from 0 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and alluvium from igneous rocks and very minor amounts of volcanic ash overlying medium to coarse textured alluvial material.  The climate is semiarid and summers are dry.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, including 1 to 3 feet of snow.  The average annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 160 days."
