  "OVERVIEW": "The Vanajo series consists of very deep, moderately well and somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone and shale. Vanajo soils occur on alluvium fans, and basin floors. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.5 degrees C.",
