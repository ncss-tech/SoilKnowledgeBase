  "OVERVIEW": "The Vidor series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils. These nearly level soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Beaumont Formation of late Pleistocene age.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1422 mm (57 in).",
