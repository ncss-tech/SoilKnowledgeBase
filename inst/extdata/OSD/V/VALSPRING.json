  "OVERVIEW": "The Valspring series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine materials or alluvium derived from basalt. Valspring soils are on upland playa locations of volcanic fields. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
