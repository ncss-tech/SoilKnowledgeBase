  "OVERVIEW": "The Victorio series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in clayey residuum and colluvium weathered from Permian Limestone and Dolomite bedrock. Slopes range from 25 to 95 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 584 mm (23 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
