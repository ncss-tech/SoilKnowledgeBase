  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to contrasting particle size classes range from 30 to 92 centimeters. The human-transported loamy fill may originate from a range of parent materials including till, eolian deposits, glaciofluvial deposits, alluvium, coastal plain sediments, or residuum, usually from a very local source. Solum thickness is 30 to 84 centimeters. Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent throughout. In the loamy human-transported material, human artifacts range from 0 to 10 percent. Textures in the loamy mantle range from silt loam to sandy loam. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately alkaline in the loamy mantle.\nThe ^A, ^Ap, or ^AB horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is defined by a weak subangular blocky or granular structure, but fine platy is present in reclaimed areas where the surface has been compacted. Discrete pieces of B horizon material are commonly identifiable within the surface horizon. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe ^Bw or ^BA horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Structure is weak subangular blocky or platy in compacted areas. Consistence is very friable or friable. Pieces of other B or A horizons are commonly mixed in. Lithochromic and relict mottles are commonly inherited from the human-transported material.\nThe ^BC or ^C horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Structure is weak subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable or friable. Pieces of other B or A horizons are commonly mixed in. Lithochromic and relict mottles are commonly inherited from the human-transported material.\nThe 2C horizons (sandy substratum) have hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value 2 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4. This horizon is typically structureless. Consistence is very friable or loose. Textures range from loamy sand through coarse sand. Many pedons have shell fragments in the lower part of the soil. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through slightly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Verrazano soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping human-altered landforms including barrier beaches and islands, dredge fills, or outwash plains. These soils formed in a thick, loamy mantle of human-transported material over sandy materials that may include sandy marine deposits, sandy dredge spoils, or sandy glaciofluvial deposits.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1020 to 1325 millimeters. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 13 degrees C."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Barren, Bigapple, Breeze, Fortress, Gravesend, Hooksan, Jamaica, and Sandyhook soils. The Bigapple, Fortress, Barren, and Jamaica soils formed in sandy dredge material and do not have a strongly contrasting particle size class within the control section.  Sandyhook soils formed in marine sands and have a water table within 40 inches from soil surface.  Breeze soils formed in sandy human-transported material and have coarse fragments ranging from 10 to 34 percent within the particle size control section. Gravesend soils formed in sandy human-transported material over household garbage, construction debris, and other discarded materials.  Hooksan soils formed entirely in sandy eolian deposits."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: This soil is well drained. The potential for surface runoff is low to medium on vegetated slopes less than 8 percent, high on vegetated slopes 8 percent and greater. The potential for surface runoff is one class higher where the soil is unvegetated or the surface is poorly protected from erosion. The saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the loamy upper part and very high in the sandy substratum."
