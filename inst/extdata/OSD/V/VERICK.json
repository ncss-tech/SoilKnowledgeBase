In a climax condition, grasses such as two flower trichloris, pink pappusgrass, plains bristlegrass, pinhole bluestem, and hooded windmillgrass dominate. About 5 percent of the plant community is shrubs and 5 percent is perennial forbs. The woody vegetation is sparse. With retrogression, plants such as red grama, threeawn, lovegrass, Hall's panicum, and fall witchgrass increase or invade. Brush plants such as blackbrush, whitebrush, guajillo, guyacan, condalia, cenizo, creosotebush, paloverde, and pricklypear also increase and invade."

The soil has an ustic soil moisture regime that borders an aridic moisture regime.\nEdited 11/2013 (RFG-GWH): added sand content to the RIC and updated the geographic setting.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 15 to 38 cm (6 to 15 in). (Btk horizon)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in) (A horizon).\nArgillic horizon: 15 to 38 cm (6 to 15 in) (Btk horizon).\nParalithic contact: 38 cm (15 in). (Crk contact)\nADDITIONAL DATA: The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from surrounding counties in the region.\nTaxonomic version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
