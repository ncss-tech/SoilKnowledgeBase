  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Verick series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum derived from interbedded sandstone bedrock of Tertiary age. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on summits and shoulders of ridges.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 508 mm (20 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 22.2 degrees C (72 degrees F).",

In a climax condition, grasses such as two flower trichloris, pink pappusgrass, plains bristlegrass, pinhole bluestem, and hooded windmillgrass dominate. About 5 percent of the plant community is shrubs and 5 percent is perennial forbs. The woody vegetation is sparse. With retrogression, plants such as red grama, threeawn, lovegrass, Hall's panicum, and fall witchgrass increase or invade. Brush plants such as blackbrush, whitebrush, guajillo, guyacan, condalia, cenizo, creosotebush, paloverde, and pricklypear also increase and invade."
