  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Vamp series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. The Vamp soils are on low terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
