  "OVERVIEW": "The Vizcaya series consists of very shallow and shallow, very poorly drained, slowly permeable soils over limestone.  They formed in loamy, marine or fresh water sediments. These  soils are in broad, low freshwater marshes of the Everglades in Southern Penninsular Florida.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.",

A thin paraphyton or marl layer may occur on the surface of some pedons.\nSome pedons have an Oa surface horizon less than 8 inches thick.  Where present the Oa0 horizon is less than 1/2 the thickness of the soil.  The Oa horizon, where present, has  hue of 10YR, value of 3 or less, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The fiber content is less than 33 percent unrubbed, and less than 5 percent rubbed.  Sodium pyrophosphate extract has hue of 10YR value of 2 through 4, chroma 4 or less; value 5, chroma 2 through 8; value 6, chroma 3 through 8; or value 7, and chroma 4 through 8.  Texture is muck.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or less, and chroma of 3 or less moist; and hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.  Texture is silt loam or mucky silt loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or less, and chroma of 3 or less; moist; and hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.   Texture is clay or sandy clay."
