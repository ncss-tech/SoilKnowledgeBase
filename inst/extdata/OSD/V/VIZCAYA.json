A thin paraphyton or marl layer may occur on the surface of some pedons.\nSome pedons have an Oa surface horizon less than 8 inches thick.  Where present the Oa0 horizon is less than 1/2 the thickness of the soil.  The Oa horizon, where present, has  hue of 10YR, value of 3 or less, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The fiber content is less than 33 percent unrubbed, and less than 5 percent rubbed.  Sodium pyrophosphate extract has hue of 10YR value of 2 through 4, chroma 4 or less; value 5, chroma 2 through 8; value 6, chroma 3 through 8; or value 7, and chroma 4 through 8.  Texture is muck.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or less, and chroma of 3 or less moist; and hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.  Texture is silt loam or mucky silt loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or less, and chroma of 3 or less; moist; and hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.   Texture is clay or sandy clay."
