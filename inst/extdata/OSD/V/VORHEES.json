  "OVERVIEW": "The Vorhees series consists of very deep, well-drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy eolian sediments of late Pleistocene to Holocene age.  These soils are on very gently to gently sloping plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F.",
