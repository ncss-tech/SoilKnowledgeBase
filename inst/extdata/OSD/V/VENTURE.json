The climate is semiarid to dry subhumid with the average annual precipitation of 12 to 14 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 59 to 61 degrees F., and the freeze-free period is 70 to 100 days."

The Semidesert sites previously included with this series are now excluded. Accordingly precipitation is narrowed from 9-14 to 12-14 inches.\nAt the type location and other locations where the parent material is alluvium it is possible the landforms are remnants of old dissected fan remnants or pediments rather than \"mountainsides and ridges\".\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
