  "OVERVIEW": "The Venture series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum and weathered from basic and intermediate igneous rocks.  Venture soils are on mountainsides and ridges and have slopes of 1 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The Semidesert sites previously included with this series are now excluded. Accordingly precipitation is narrowed from 9-14 to 12-14 inches.\nAt the type location and other locations where the parent material is alluvium it is possible the landforms are remnants of old dissected fan remnants or pediments rather than \"mountainsides and ridges\"."
