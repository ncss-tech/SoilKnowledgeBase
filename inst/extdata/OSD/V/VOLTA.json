Most pedons, when moist, have mottles with chromas of 2 or less in addition to other chromas.  It is clay loam or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay content and always has more than 1.2 times more clay than the A horizon.  Some pedons have clay films.  The EC ranges from 2 to 6 mmhos/cm.  ESP is 15 to 30.  It is slightly to violently effervescent. It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bkg horizon dry color is 10YR 7/3; 2.5Y 4/2, 5/4; 5Y 5/1 or 7/3.  In some pedons mottles are few fine distinct 10YR 4/6, 8/6; or 5Y 7/1.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/3, 5/4, 6/4; 2.5Y 4/2, 4/4, 5/3, 6/4; 5Y 3/1, 5/2, 5/3, 6/1 or 5GY 5/1.  Moist mottles are common medium prominent 7.5YR 3/2; 2.5Y 5/4, 6/4; or 5Y 6/1.  It is clay loam or clay with 30 to 45 percent clay content.  The EC ranges from 2 to 6 mmhos/cm.  The ESP ranges from 8 to 15.  It is slightly to violently effervescent and is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon dry color si 10YR 5/4, 6/3, 7/2, 8/3; 2.5Y 6/4; 5Y 4/1, 6/1 or 8/1.  Mottles range from few fine distinct to common medium prominent and are 5Y 6/1 or 6/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/3, 5/3, 5/4, 6/4; 2.5Y 5/4; 5Y 5/3, 8/2; or 5B 4/1.  Moist mottles range from few fine prominent to many medium prominent and are 5Y 4/2 or 5GY 5/1.  Some parts of the pan are stratified and lenses or strata of sandy clay loam, clay loam or clay.  Durinoides range from 20 to 80 percent, are from 2 to 30 mm in size, and may be rounded or angular.  Some pedons have an opal laminar cap on top of the pan.  The pan is thicker than 30 inches, is stratified with soil material, and extends to depths below 90 inches.  The artesian water flows through and under the pan."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Healdton series in the same family and the Britto, Devries (T), Dosamigos, Pedcat, Rioblanco, Santanela, and Turlock series in other families.  Rioblanco and Devries soils have a dark colored A horizon and lack a natric horizon.  Britto soils lack a duripan.  Dosamigos soils lack a duripan and a natric horizon.  Healdton soils lack a duripan, occur on flood plains that are occasionally flooded, and occur in a moist subhumid climate.  Pedcat soils have a xeric moisture regime bordering on aquic and lack a duripan.  Santanela and Turlock soils are fine-loamy and lack a duripan."

They are on nearly level topography.  elevations are 80 to 110 feet.  The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 to 12 inches.  The mean January temperature is 46 degrees F; mean July tmeperature is 79 degrees F; and mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 210 to 280 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil is being reactivated.  It was originally classified as a maximal solonetz soil.  These were mapped as Volta soils in the Los Banos Area soil survey.  They are being redefined to include a thicker duripan and hydrostatic water table pressure under and in the duripan. The control section in differentiation of series (page 391, item (3); Soil Taxonomy) is to the bottom of named diagnostic horizons and any subjacent Cca horizon if the thickness of both exceeds 1 meter.  EC and ESP determined by saturation extract, solubridge and versenate titration method.  pH determined by colorimetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Troug Triplex indicators.  Texture determined by modified Bouyoucos method.  Calcium carbonate equivalent determined by field HC1 double syringe kit.  Organic matter determined by Walkley-Black digestion method.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in March of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
