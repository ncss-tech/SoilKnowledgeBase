The structure is weak medium subangular blocky in Ap horizons.  The EC is less than 2 mmhos/cm and the ESP is less than 15.  Soil in some pedons does not effervesce.

Durinoides range from 20 to 80 percent, are from 2 to 30 mm in size, and may be rounded or angular.  Some pedons have an opal laminar cap on top of the pan.  The pan is thicker than 30 inches, is stratified with soil material, and extends to depths below 90 inches.  The artesian water flows through and under the pan."

Rioblanco and Devries soils have a dark colored A horizon and lack a natric horizon.  Britto soils lack a duripan.  Dosamigos soils lack a duripan and a natric horizon.  Healdton soils lack a duripan, occur on flood plains that are occasionally flooded, and occur in a moist subhumid climate.  Pedcat soils have a xeric moisture regime bordering on aquic and lack a duripan.  Santanela and Turlock soils are fine-loamy and lack a duripan."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil is being reactivated.  It was originally classified as a maximal solonetz soil.  These were mapped as Volta soils in the Los Banos Area soil survey.  They are being redefined to include a thicker duripan and hydrostatic water table pressure under and in the duripan. The control section in differentiation of series (page 391, item (3); Soil Taxonomy) is to the bottom of named diagnostic horizons and any subjacent Cca horizon if the thickness of both exceeds 1 meter.  EC and ESP determined by saturation extract, solubridge and versenate titration method.  pH determined by colorimetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Troug Triplex indicators.  Texture determined by modified Bouyoucos method.  Calcium carbonate equivalent determined by field HC1 double syringe kit.  Organic matter determined by Walkley-Black digestion method.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in March of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET"
