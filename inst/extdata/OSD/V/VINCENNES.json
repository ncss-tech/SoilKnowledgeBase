Coarse fragments range from none to 10 percent in the solum and C horizon.\nWhere present, the A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1.  It is slightly acid to strongly acid and 2 to 4 inches thick.  The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam and is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is commonly clay loam, sandy clay loam or loam and subhorizons are silty clay loam in some pedons.  It is firm or friable.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper 10 inches and very strongly acid to medium acid in the lower part.  A B1 horizon is in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 or 6; and chroma of 1 to 4.  It commonly is stratified.  Textures include clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam, sandy loam and silt loam.  It ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nA sandy substratum phase and a flooded phase are recognized."

The climate is midcontinental type; summers are hot and winters are cold.  The average daily minimum temperature in January is about 22 degrees F.  The average daily maximum temperature in July is 88 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature ranges from about 53 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 40 to 45 inches."
