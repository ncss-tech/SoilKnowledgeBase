  "OVERVIEW": "The Voladora series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils on hills on the Humid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  They formed in fine-textured volcanic and marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 78 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches.  Slopes range from 5 to 20 percent.",
