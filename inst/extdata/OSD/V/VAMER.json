  "OVERVIEW": "The Vamer series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from shale over sandstone. Vamer soils are on ridges, mesas, and hills. Slopes range from 1 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

(Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nOchric epipedon:  the zone from 0 to 4 inches. (A horizon)Thickness is insufficient for mollic epipedon.\nArgillic horizon:  the zone from 4 to 16 inches. (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nLithic contact:  hard sandstone at 16 inches. (2R horizon)\nThe 4/2001 change in soil moisture in the range in characteristics returns the Vamer series to the seasonal moisture pattern typical of Colfax County, New Mexico.\nAt some time after 1991 the mineralogy was changed from mixed to smectitic. No documentation could be found to substantiate that change, so the 11/2007 revision changes the mineralogy back to mixed. The Raton Formation, where the Vamer typical pedon is located, typically yields soils that have mixed clay mineralogy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
