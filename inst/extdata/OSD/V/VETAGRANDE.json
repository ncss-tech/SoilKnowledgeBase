Bullvaro soils have mollic epipedons more than 76 cm thick, are strongly influenced by loess in the upper part of the profile, and have 60 to 75 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Burchflat and Vipont soils have a xeric moisture regime and are moderately deep to lithic contacts.    Dooh soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Erig soils have a xeric moisture regime and are deep to lithic contacts.  Leroman and Staberg soils have a xeric moisture regime and are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Lockgate soils have a xeric moisture regime and are deep to paralithic contacts.  Nutval soils have more than 40 percent medium sand through very coarse sand in the particle-size control section and are dominated by gravel derived from granitic rock."
