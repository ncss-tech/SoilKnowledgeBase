  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of solum and depth to free carbonates typically are about 40 to 50 inches but range from 30 to 60 inches.  Thickness of the moderately fine and fine textured sediments typically is about 40 to 50 inches but range to as much as 70 inches or more in thickness in some pedons.  Clay content of the sediments ranges from about 35 to 45 percent.  Sand content typically ranges from about 5 to 15 percent.  The sand is mostly fine or very fine in size.  Coarse or very coarse sand typically is absent in the sediments, but small shale fragments make up as much as 5 percent of the volume in some pedons.  The solum typically is neutral or slightly acid in the upper 40 to 50 inches and mildly to moderately alkaline below these depths.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 24 inches thick.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and value of 1 or 2.  The AB horizon is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) or dark brown (10YR 3/3).  A BA horizon is in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4 in the upper part, but the lower part ranges to hue of 2.5Y.  Coatings that are about one value or chroma lower than the matrix color are on most faces of the peds.  Few to common low and high chroma mottles are in the lower part of the Bt horizon of most pedons.  A BC or C horizon is in some pedons.\nThe 2BC and 2C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The 2BC and 2C horizons are loam or clay loam with about 20 to 30 percent clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Kamrar series in the same family and the Bode, Collinwood, Kingston, and Truman soils.  Kamrar soils contain more sand in the upper glacial or lacustrine sediments and are underlain by glacial till within depths of 24 to 40 inches.  Bode soils are fine-loamy.  Collinwood and Kingston soils have lower chroma in the upper part of the B horizon.  Truman soils are fine silty."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vinje soils are on convex knobs and side slopes on glacial moraines or lake plains.  The topography is hummocky with high surface relief.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 14 percent.  These soils formed in 40 to 70 inches or more of glacial lacustrine sediments overlying glacial till.  The sediments are late Wisconsinan in age and contain less than 25 percent sand.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 32 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Collinwood and Kamrar soils and the Marna, Storden, and Waldorf soils.  Collinwood, Marna, and Waldorf soils are on nearly level areas.  These soils have lower chroma in the upper part of the B horizon.  Kamrar soils are on similar or slightly lower lying areas on the landscape.  Storden soils formed in calcareous glacial till and are on side slopes below the Vinje soils."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Few faint clay films are present in the B horizon of most pedons; however, the laboratory data indicates that there is not a sufficient increase in clay for an argillic horizon.  This soil was correlated as a Collinwood Variant in Dickinson County, Iowa.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of approximately 20 inches (Ap, A, AB horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from approximately 20 to 46 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, 2BC horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
