  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Venice soils are in fresh water marshes and river channels and have slopes of less than 2 percent.  The soils formed from hydrophytic plant remains mostly from tules, reeds and mixed mineral alluvium.  The soils are in islands protected by levees at elevations of 0 to 6 meters (0 to 20 feet) below sea level.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 356 to 406 millimeters (14 to 16 inches).  Mean January temperature is about 7 degrees C (45 degrees F); mean July temperature is about 24 degrees C (75 degrees F); mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C (60 degrees F).  Frost-free season ranges from 250 to 300 days."

Ryde soils are on flood plains and Valdez soils are on old river channels.  Kingile soils have continuous mineral soil material at depths of less than 91 centimeters (36 inches).  Rindge soils have less than 16 percent rubbed fibers dominating the control section.  Ryde and Valdez soils are mineral soils."
