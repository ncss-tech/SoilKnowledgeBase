Some areas in crop production have supplemental irrigation where suitable water is available.  Crops are mainly grain sorghum, cotton, and corn with some small areas in vegetables.  Native grasses are mainly little bluestem, seacoast bluestem, fourflower trichloris, vine-mesquite, and indiangrass.  Improved pasture is mainly coastal bermudagrass or Kleingrass.  Native woody plants are invaders and consist mainly of mesquite trees, spiny hackberry, huisache, brazil, and lotebush.  The ecological site is Blackland, PEZ 3124-44 (R150AY526TX)."

The series type location was moved in 05/2005 to a site with characterization data.  Classification changed 05/2005 from Typic Haplusterts to Sodic Haplusterts based on characterization data from several pedons across the series province.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 94 cm (0 to 37 in). (Ap, Bss1, and Bss2 horizons)\nSlickensides: 15 to 127 cm (6 to 50 in). (Bss1, Bss2, and Bnss horizons)\nSodic feature: SAR of 24 at 94 cm (37 in)\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization data at the series type location by the Soil Characterization Laboratory at Texas A&M University on sample S82TX-355-002.  Additional characterization data by the NationalKellogg Soil Survey Laboratory on samples Nos. K393-397, K383-387, K388-392, 5032-5039, 5018-5024, and from samples for microhighs and microlows on project CP00TX020 and I2001USTX165.
