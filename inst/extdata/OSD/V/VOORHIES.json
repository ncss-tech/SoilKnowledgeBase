    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 56 degrees F.  Thickness of the solum and depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist.  It has 35 to 60 percent angular gravel.  It has 2 to 4 percent organic matter.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  It has 25 to 50 percent angular gravel and 10 to 25 percent  angular cobbles and exceeds 35 percent in combination.  It is clay loam or loam, and averages 25 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Uncoated sand and silt layers are common in the upper part of the B horizon.  It is slightly acid or neutral."

The soils formed in colluvium weathered from altered sedimentary and extrusive igneous rocks.  The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 170 days."
