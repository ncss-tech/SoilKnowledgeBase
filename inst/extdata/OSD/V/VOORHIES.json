  "OVERVIEW": "The Voorhies series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from altered sedimentary and extrusive igneous rocks.  Voorhies soils are on mountain slopes and have slopes of 35 to 55 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 56 degrees F.  Thickness of the solum and depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist.  It has 35 to 60 percent angular gravel.  It has 2 to 4 percent organic matter.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  It has 25 to 50 percent angular gravel and 10 to 25 percent  angular cobbles and exceeds 35 percent in combination.  It is clay loam or loam, and averages 25 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Uncoated sand and silt layers are common in the upper part of the B horizon.  It is slightly acid or neutral."
