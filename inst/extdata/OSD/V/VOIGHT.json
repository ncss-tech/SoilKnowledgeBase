Floodwood soils have an 11 to 18 inch thick mantle of volcanic ash and are 18 to 27 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Jewett soils have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have a silt loam loess mantle 15 to 30 inches thick.  Watton soils have an E horizon that qualifies as an albic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevations range from 1,700 to 2,800 feet.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from andesite, basalt, and tuff breccia.  The climate is marine influenced, with relatively cool dry summers and cool wet winters.  The average annual precipitation is 60 to 90 inches, occurring mostly as snowfall and heavy rainfall during late autumn and winter.  The average January temperature is about 30 degrees F; average July temperature is about 63 degrees F; and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 130 to 175 days."
