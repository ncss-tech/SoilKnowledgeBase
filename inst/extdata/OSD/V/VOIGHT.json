Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent materials coarser than very fine sand including 0 to 30 percent coarse fragments.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has weak to strong subangular blocky or granular structure.\nThe Bt1 and Bt2 horizon have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or gravelly silty clay loam.  These horizons have weak or moderate angular or subangular blocky structure.  Clay films are faint or distinct.\nThe Bt3 horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam, gravelly silty clay loam, gravelly loam, silty clay loam, gravelly loam, silt loam, or gravelly silt loam, and has 0 to 35 percent coarse fragments.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.

Carrollton and Kinzua soils receive summer precipitation.  Christoff soils have a mantle of volcanic ash 7 to 14 inches thick.  Floodwood soils have an 11 to 18 inch thick mantle of volcanic ash and are 18 to 27 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Jewett soils have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have a silt loam loess mantle 15 to 30 inches thick.  Watton soils have an E horizon that qualifies as an albic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Voight soils are on uplands and mountainous areas in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  Elevations range from 1,700 to 2,800 feet.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from andesite, basalt, and tuff breccia.  The climate is marine influenced, with relatively cool dry summers and cool wet winters.  The average annual precipitation is 60 to 90 inches, occurring mostly as snowfall and heavy rainfall during late autumn and winter.  The average January temperature is about 30 degrees F; average July temperature is about 63 degrees F; and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 130 to 175 days."
