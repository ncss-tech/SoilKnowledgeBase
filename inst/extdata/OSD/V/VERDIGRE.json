    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches in thickness.  The depth to carbonates ranges from 18 to 35 inches.  The solum ranges from 30 to 50 inches thick.  Depth to bedded shale ranges from 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 (2 or 3 moist) and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is dominantly loam or fine sandy loam but ranges to include sandy loam and silt loam.  It ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 (4 or 5 moist) and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is dominantly clay loam but the range includes silty clay loam and loam.  Clay ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  It ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 7 (4 through 6 moist) and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is silty clay or clay averaging between 45 and 60 percent clay.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 7 (4 through 6 moist) and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is silty clay or clay and ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  It contains 0 to 15 percent by volume of shale channers.\nThe 2Cr horizon is bedded shale.  It has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 8 (4 through 7 moist) and chroma of 1 through 6.  Accumulations of carbonates are in the upper part of the shale in most pedons.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Glenham, Gosper, Hennings (T), Houdek, Ree, Reventon, Wewela, and Wineg series in the same family.  Glenham and Houdek soils formed in glacial till.  In addition, Glenham soils have free carbonates within depths of 20 inches and Houdek soils have Bk horizons over 15 inches thick.  Hennings soils have sandstone at depths of 40 and 60 inches.  Gosper soils formed in alluvium and typically are shallower to free carbonates.  Ree soils have Bk horizons over 10 inches thick.  Reventon soils have free carbonates within a depth of 14 inches.   Wewela soils have shale bedrock within a depth of 40 inches. Wineg soils are shallower to free carbonates and have less mean annual predication."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Verdigre soils are on upland divides and side slopes having plane or convex surfaces.  The slope gradient ranges from 2 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in loamy eolian material deposited on material weathered from clayey shales.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 25 inches."
