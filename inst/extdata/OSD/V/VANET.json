  "OVERVIEW": "The Vanet series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils on sideslopes of mesas.  They formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from sedimentary rocks.  Slope ranges from 20 to 40 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 19 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth of soil material over soft weathered limestone or shale (paralithic contact) ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The depth to bedrock (lithic contact) ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments average 35 to 50 percent in the particle size control section.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 44 to 47 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is about 59 to 64 degrees F.\nThe A horizon is noncalcareous or slightly calcareous.  The A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and chroma of 3 or 4 moist.  If the value is less than 3.6 moist and the chroma is less than 4 moist, the thickness of the horizon is less than 1/3 the thickness of the solum.\nThe Bt and Bw horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is gravelly loam to gravelly, very gravelly and cobbly clay loam.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is strongly or very strongly calcareous."

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from shale and limestone.  Slope gradients are 20 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches and the freeze-free period ranges from 70 to 80 days.  The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly classified as Gray-Wooded soils.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 2 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - from 2 to 7 inches (Bt horizon)\nCalcic horizon - the zone from 11 to 14 inches Bk horizon)\nThis series was originally classified as Typic Ustochrepts. Because of the clay films and clay increase described in the 2 to 7 inch layer, it was decided in 2004 to recognize this layer as an argillic horizon. This needs to be confirmed in the field. The Loamy-skeletal particle-size family is in question at this time; in the typical pedon, the weighted average rock fragment content of the PSCS is 31% (Loamy). It is decided to leave the family class as Loamy-skeletal, assuming this family more accurately reflects this soil as is has been mapped."
