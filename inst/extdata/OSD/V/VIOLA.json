    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Viola soils are in concave areas on terraces at elevations from 300 to 600 feet.  They developed in old sediments mainly from basaltic and andesitic rocks.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  The mean January temperature is 38 degrees F and in July it is 64 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is 165 to 180 days.  The average annual precipitation is 45 to 65 inches."

Godfrey soils are fine textured, lack an argillic horizon, and are on flood plains.  Mart, Olympic, and Seaquest soils are well drained and have a xeric moisture regime.  Snohomish soils lack an argillic horizon and have organic layers in the particle-size control section."
