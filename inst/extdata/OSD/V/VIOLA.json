The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  The mean January temperature is 38 degrees F and in July it is 64 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is 165 to 180 days.  The average annual precipitation is 45 to 65 inches."
