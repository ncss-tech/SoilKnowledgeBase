  "OVERVIEW": "The Vale series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or residuum derived from reddish siltstone and silty shale.  Vale soils are on backslopes and footslopes of terraces, fans, fan remnants, and hillslopes on uplands and in valleys.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 482 mm (19 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F).",
