  "OVERVIEW": "The Vaeda series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from shale.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
