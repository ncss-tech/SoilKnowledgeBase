  "REVDATE": "05/1999",
  "STATES": "CO,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Venable series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Venable soils are on alluvial valley floors, low terraces, flood plains, and drainageways of mountain valleys and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
