  "OVERVIEW": "The Vado series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sediments derived from rhyolite, andesite, latite, and dacite.  Vado soils are on nearly level to moderate slopes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
