    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chesebro, Eep, Lyonman, Monasterio, Tourn, Warnermount, and Willowak series.\nChesebro soils have mollic epipedons that do not include part of the argillic horizon and have surface horizons dominated by cobbles and stones.  Eep soils have mollic epipedons less than 50 cm thick and have greater than 65 percent volcanic glass content in all horizons.  Lyonman, Tourn and Willowak soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Monasterio and Warnermount soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vetash soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on footslope and backslope positions.  They formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rock such andesite or tuff with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,134 to 2,840 meters.  The climate is continental with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."
