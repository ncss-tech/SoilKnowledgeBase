  "OVERVIEW": "The Vetash series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rock with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  Vetash soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

They formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rock such andesite or tuff with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,134 to 2,840 meters.  The climate is continental with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."
