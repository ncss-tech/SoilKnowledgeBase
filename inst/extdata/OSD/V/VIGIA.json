Reaction of the profile varies from strongly to slightly acid.\nThe Oa layers vary in hues of 2.5Y, values of 2 and chromas of 1 or less.  They are friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic.  Roots vary from many fine to common fine.  Fiber content is less than 5 percent.\nThe C horizons are firm, sticky, plastic and of clay texture.  The upper part of the C horizon has hues of 10YR, values of 5 and 6 and chromas of 1 or 2.  The lower part of the C horizon has colors in hues of 10YR to 5YR, values and chromas of 4 to 6 with mottles of light brownish gray, bluish gray, yellowish red and brownish yellow."
