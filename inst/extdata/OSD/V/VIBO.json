The solum usually has less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent within 40 inches of the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4, 5, or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4, 5, or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.

Elevations range from 6,400 feet to 7,400 feet.  The annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches with a large proportion resulting from intense late summer thunderstorms. The frost-free season is about 120 to 150 days.  The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 55 degrees F."
