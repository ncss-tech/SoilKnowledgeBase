  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils have gilgai microrelief, and the surfaces are plane to concave.  Slopes are dominantly less than 1 percent, but range to 3 percent.  The soil formed in calcareous clayey alluvium several feet thick.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 16 inches, and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 62 to 69 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 210 to 250 days, and elevation ranges from 2,500 to 5,500 feet."
