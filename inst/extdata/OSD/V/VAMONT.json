In 2 to 4 years out of 10 these soils have aquic soil conditions.\nVertisol feature: Slickensides at a depth of 48 to 203 cm (19 to 80 in) with cracks that extend to a depth of 51 cm (20 in) or more during dry periods.\nAdditional Comments:  Vamont soils were formerly included with the Vaiden series.  These soils were formerly classified as Aquentic Chromuderts and were reclassified to Oxyaquic Hapluderts 10/94 based on amendment 16 to Soil Taxonomy.  The series was reclassified in April 2000 from Hapluderts to Dystruderts based on lab data.  The series type location was moved to Hardin County, April 2000, to reflect a more central location in the series province with lab data.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Data from the Texas A&M University Soil Characterization Laboratory on sample S98TX199-001; Hardin County, Texas.\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
