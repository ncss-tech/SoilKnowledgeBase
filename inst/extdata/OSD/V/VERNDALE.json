  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates range from 22 inches to 60 inches or more.  Depth to loamy sand and sand ranges from 14 to 22 inches.  The loamy sediments contain 0 to 8 percent gravel by volume and the underlying sediments contain 0 to 15 percent gravel by volume.  Gravel size is dominantly 2mm to less than 10mm.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick.  The soil moisture control section is moist in some or all parts throughout the year in 6 or more years out of 10.\nThe A or Ap horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The Bt is typically sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  Some pedons have a 2Bt horizon of loamy sand or loamy coarse sand.   The Bt and 2Bt horizons have few to many faint or distinct clay films on the faces of peds.  They are strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or coarse sand.  It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sand or coarse sand.  Many pedons have thin fine sand strata.  It is strongly acid to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Verndale soils are nearly level to gently sloping and are on slightly convex, plane, or concave positions on outwash plains.  They formed in a thin loamy mantle and underlying sandy outwash.  These sediments are Late Wisconsinan Age.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 28 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 150.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 675 to 1400 feet."

The Abbeylake, Dorset, and Nymore soils typically are on more convex slopes.  The Oylen soils are in slightly lower positions and the Forada, Isan and Pinelake soils are typically on lower more concave parts of outwash plain and terraces."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 9 inches (Ap horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 9 to 19 inches (Bt horizons); this soil is in a Udic moisture regime.  The moisture control section is moist in some or all parts throughout the ear in 6 or more out of 10 years.  An acid substratum phase is recognized.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to MN Agriculture Experiment Station Central File Code No. 3843 for results of some laboratory analysis of the typical pedon of this series and 3699 for additional data.
