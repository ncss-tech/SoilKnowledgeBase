Combined thickness of the A and E horizons ranges from 16 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3; or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2.  Texture is silt loam or loam (18 to 26 percent clay).  Reaction is strongly acid or medium acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3; or hue of 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2.  Some pedons do not have mottles in the A horizon and E horizon.  Texture is silt loam or loam.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to very strongly acid.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles are in shades of brown or red.  Texture is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Reaction is strongly or very strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has the same colors as the BA horizon or it is coarsely mottled in shades of yellow, brown, red, or gray.  Texture is clay loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.  Interfingering of E material in the Bt horizon makes up less than 5 percent by volume."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Falker and Nesbitt series in the same family.  Soils in similar families are the Atwood, Bernaldo, Bernow, Burwell, Fetzer, Freest, Freestone, Gallime, Glenmora, Hamden, Katz, Keithville, Kolin, Lexington, Muskogee, Stigler, Tamaha, Tanyard, Tippah, and Wetsaw series.  Falkner soils have a lower Bt horizon that has a gray matrix and more clayey texture.  Nesbitt soils have redder hue in the Bt horizon.  Atwood and Lexington soils do not have wetness mottles within 30 inches of the soil surface.  Bernaldo, Bernow, Freestone, and Gallime series have a fine-loamy control section and have more than 6 percent of E material in the Bt horizon.  Burwell soils have a mollic epipedon and mixed mineralogy.  Fetzer, Freest, Hamden, Katz, Tanyard, and Wetsaw soils have a fine-loamy control section.  Glenmora, Keithville, and Kolin soils have more than 6 percent of E material in the Bt horizon.  Muskogee and Tippah soils have mixed mineralogy.  In addition, Muskogee soils have more clay in the lower Bt horizon, and the Tippah soils have redder hue in the Bt horizon.    Stigler and Tamaha soils have a fine control section."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Vian soils are on broad stream terraces of uplands in the Arkansas Valley and ridges.  Slopes are 1 to 5 percent.  They formed in loamy material weathered from old alluvium of Quaternary age.  The climate is humid.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 46 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 65 degrees F.  The Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 64 to 80."
