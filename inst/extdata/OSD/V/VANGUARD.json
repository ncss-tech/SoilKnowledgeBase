Organic matter is 1 to 2 percent in the surface horizon and decreases irregularly with increasing depth.  Calcium carbonate is usually not present in the surface horizon of most pedons.  The percent total dissolved solids range from .05 to 2 percent within the upper 40 inches.  The soil has a high amount of mica throughout the profile.  SAR values vary from 13 to 60 in the upper 20 inches and decrease with depth to values that range from 30 to 50.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 2.5Y 5/2; 5Y 4/1 or 4/2 and moist color of 2.5Y 3/2; 5Y 3/1 or 2/2.  It is sandy loam or loam.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 2.5Y 6/2, 5/2, 5Y 5/2, or 10YR 5/2 and moist color of 2.5Y 4/2 or 10YR 3/2.  It has stratified layers of fine sandy loam, silt loam, and loam and sandy clay loam.  Few to common mottles are in the lower part of the C horizon."
