  "OVERVIEW": "The Veetee series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in residuum fine-grained limestone and dolomite.  Veetee soils are on summits and sideslopes of structural benches on plateaus. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
