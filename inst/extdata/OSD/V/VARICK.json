  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches and commonly corresponds with thickness of solum. Free carbonates are common within 6 inches above the bedrock surface.  Rock fragments are dominantly soft shale but includes sandstone and limestone in some pedons. Rock fragments range from 2 percent by volume in the surface horizons, to as much as 50 percent just above the bedrock, but average less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section. Some shale fragments disperse upon shaking with Calgon. Reaction in the solum ranges from moderately acid through neutral and from slightly acid through slightly alkaline in the substratum. Chroma of 2 or less occupies more than 50 percent of the matrix from the base of the A or Ap horizon to 30 inches.\nThe thickness of the A horizon in undisturbed areas ranges from 5 to 7 inches, and the lower boundary is abrupt. The series includes only soils in which the Ap or A horizon is less than 1/3 the thickness of solum or is less than 10 inches thick.\nThe Ap and A horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Eg horizon, if present, has chroma of 2 or less with few to common redoximorphic features. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from loam to silty clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. Structure is moderate to strong angular or subangular blocky. Consistence is firm or friable. Redoximorphic features of higher chroma than the matrix range from few to many but are less than 50 percent of the mass. Clay films of 0, 1, or 2 chroma coat ped faces and line pores.\nThe C horizon, if present, is similar to B horizons in color, texture, and consistence. It has greater amounts of shale fragments, and is massive or retains plat-like divisions inherited from the shale bedrock. The contact with bedrock is either lithic or paralithic.\nThe 2R horizon is dominantly shale but includes some pedons that are underlain with siltstone, sandstone or limestone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Varick series occupies uniform to slightly concave areas on upland till plains. The regolith is glacial till or congeliturbate strongly influenced by clayey shales, or by lake sediments from such shales, intermixed with glacial drift of limestone and sandstone. Bedrock is at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Slope ranges fro 0 to 8 percent. The climate is humid and cool temperate. Mean annual rainfall ranges from 30 to 45 inches; mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F.; and the frost-free period ranges from 140 to 180 days. The elevation ranges from 200 to 1500 feet above sea level."

It occurs in the same general area as the very deep Honeoye, Ontario, Lansing, Cazenovia and Danley soils on glacial till plains and Schoharie, Hudson and Dunkirk soils are nearby on lake plains."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Unclassified soils whose Ap horizons exceed one-third the thickness of relatively thin solums are inclusions in mapping units of the Varick series. Varick soils were previously classified in the great group of Ochraqualfs. Because of changes established in the 5th and 6th editions of `Keys to Soil Taxonomy' these soils now classify in the new great group of Endoaqualfs. Competing series in the same family are expected to increase as similar soils are reclassified. Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\na) Argillic horizon - from 10 to 23 inches (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons)\nb) Mollic subgroup - as evidenced by moist values of 3 or less and dry values of 5 or less (Ap horizon) and is too thin for a mollisol\nc) Aqualfs suborder - as evidenced by low chroma (2 or less) matrix or ped face colors accompanied by redoximorphic concentrations in the upper 12.5cm of the argillic horizon (Btg1 horizon)\nSoil Interpretation Record No.:  NY0155\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
