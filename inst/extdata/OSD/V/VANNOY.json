  "OVERVIEW": "The Vannoy series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from metamorphic and sedimentary rocks.  Vannoy soils are on uplands and have slopes of 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 56 degrees F.  Depth to the paralithic contact and thickness of the solum range from 20 to 40 inches.  Hard rock fragments in the particle-size control section range from 0 to 10 percent; soft rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.  It has 2 to 4 percent organic matter.  It is strongly to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist or dry.  It is clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Faces of peds in the upper part of the B horizon are coated with clear sand and silt grains in some pedons.  It is moderately or slightly acid."
