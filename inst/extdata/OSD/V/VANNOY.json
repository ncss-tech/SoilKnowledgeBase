    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry for 80 to 110 consecutive days within the four month period following the summer solstice in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches and are moist for 90 consecutive days or more in most years in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches within the four month period following the winter solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 56 degrees F.  Depth to the paralithic contact and thickness of the solum range from 20 to 40 inches.  Hard rock fragments in the particle-size control section range from 0 to 10 percent; soft rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.  It has 2 to 4 percent organic matter.  It is strongly to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist or dry.  It is clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Faces of peds in the upper part of the B horizon are coated with clear sand and silt grains in some pedons.  It is moderately or slightly acid."

Bancas soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 57 to 59 degrees F and is dry over 100 consecutive days.  Bull Trail and Shefflein soils are over 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Hilt soils contain over 45 percent sand in the particle-size control section and have less than 1 percent organic matter in the surface 7 inches.  Mary soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vannoy soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes at elevations of 1,000 to 4,000 feet.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in moderately fine textured colluvium weathered from altered sedimentary and extrusive igneous rocks.  The climate consists of warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 170 days."
