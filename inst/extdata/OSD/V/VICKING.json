    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Vicking soils are at elevations of 5,300 to 7,850 feet (1,615 to 2,390 m). They occur on fan remnants, foothills and mountain slopes.  Slope gradients are 1 to 60 percent. These soils formed in residuum, alluvium and colluvium principally from andesite, dacite, basalt, and tuff with minor amounts of sandstone and shale. The climate is subhumid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 25 inches (305 to 635 mm), although ranges of 12 to 16 inches (305 to 406 mm) are most typical. The mean annual temperature is 36 to 44 degrees F (2.2 to 6.7 degrees C). , The freeze-free period ranges from 50 to 100 days."

Cloud Rim, Hades and Isbell soils lack a horizon of carbonate accumulation. Gridge soils have a lithic contact less than 20 inches (50 cm)."
