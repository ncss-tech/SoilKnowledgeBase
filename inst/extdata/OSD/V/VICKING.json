  "OVERVIEW": "The Vicking series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium and residuum from andesite, dacite, basalt, tuff, sandstone, quartzite and shale. Vicking soils occur on fan remnants, foothills and mountain slopes and have slopes of 1 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 19 inches (483 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F (4.4 degrees C).",

The climate is subhumid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 25 inches (305 to 635 mm), although ranges of 12 to 16 inches (305 to 406 mm) are most typical. The mean annual temperature is 36 to 44 degrees F (2.2 to 6.7 degrees C). , The freeze-free period ranges from 50 to 100 days."
