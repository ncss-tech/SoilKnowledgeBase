  "OVERVIEW": "The Villegreen Series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess over sandstone.  These soils are on plains, ridges and interfluves. Slopes range 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
