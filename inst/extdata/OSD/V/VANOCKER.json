  "OVERVIEW": "The Vanocker series consists of deep to very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from sedimentary rocks.  Vanocker soils are on gently sloping to very steep ridges and hillslopes in mountains.  They have moderately low and moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Slopes range from 2 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 585 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
