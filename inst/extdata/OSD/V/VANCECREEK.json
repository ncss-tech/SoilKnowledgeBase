  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the A and Bg horizons and from strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the Cg horizon.  Vancecreek pedons typically do not have coarse fragments.  Free carbonates are absent to a depth of at least 6 feet. Chroma of 1 or 2 and redox concentrations are in the lower part of the mollic epipedon.   Redox concentrations are typically throughout the soil below the mollic epipedon and redox depletions are dominant in the matrix.  Saturation occurs within 16 to 20 inches of the soil surface much of the time in most years.\nThe A horizons have value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Cg or C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or 5GY; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 4."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  It is assumed that the Sturgill series which competed as a Fluvaquentic Haplaquoll will be reclassified as a Fluvaquentic Endoaquoll.  A similar soil is the Ettrick series.  Sturgill soils have buried A horizons within 40 inches and typically have lenses of volcanic ash within 40 inches.  In addition, they are dryer in the series control section during the growing season (MAP = 16 inches).  Ettrick soils are mesic."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vancecreek soils are commonly on flood plains.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in silty alluvium.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 90 to 125 days.  Elevation ranges from 800 to 1950 feet."

The moderately well drained Doritty soils and the well drained Wickware soils are on higher landscape positions on foot slopes and side slopes of adjacent uplands.  The poorly drained and very poorly drained Fordum and Rib soils are nearby in similar landscape positions where the loamy of silty mantle is less than 40 inches thick over sandy outwash."

It has an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth from 1 foot above to 1 foot below the surface at some time during the period from October to June in most years."
