  "REVDATE": "03/2009",
  "STATES": "SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Venagro series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of loamy eolian material and in the underlying till. Venagro soils are on nearly level to gently sloping till plains and high terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 610 centimeters (24 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C (41 degrees F).",
