Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  It is medium acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2 or it is mottled in shades of gray or brown.  At least 1 subhorizon has dominant chroma of 2.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Agb, where present and the 2Bgb horizons have the same color range as the A horizon.  They are clay or silty clay.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Soils in similar families include the Bruin, Commerce, Convent, Mhoon, and Sharkey series.  All of these lack contrasting texture above 40 inches and all but Sharkey soils lack clayey horizons between 15 and 36 inches.  Mhoon and Sharkey soils have dominant chroma of 1 in all horizons between the base of the A horizon and 30 inches, and Sharkey soils are clayey throughout the 10 to 40 inch section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vacherie soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping flood plains of 0 to 3 percent slopes.  They have formed from recent silty Mississippi River alluvium deposited over alluvial clays.  Most areas are protected by levees.  The climate is humid subtropical.  Mean annual temperature is about 68.3 degrees F, and annual rainfall is about 64 inches near the type location."
