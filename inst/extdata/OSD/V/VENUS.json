  "OVERVIEW": "The Venus series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy calcareous alluvial sediments. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils occur mainly on stream terraces and footslopes of hills and ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 in).",
