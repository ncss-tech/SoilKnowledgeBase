  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 34\nto about 50 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 40\ninches in thickness.  Texture of all horizons ranges from silty\nclay loam, clay loam to silty clay, with a clay content ranging\nfrom 35 to 50 percent.  Fragments of limestone from 1/8 to 3 inch\nrange from few to common throughout the pedon.  The matrix is\ncalcareous throughout.\nThe A horizon has values of 4 or 5, chromas of 2 or 3 in 7.5YR\nhues or values of 3 or 4, chromas of 2, 3 or 4 in 10YR hues.\nStructure ranges from fine granular in the upper part to fine\nsubangular blocky and granular in the lower part.\nThe B horizon has values of 5 or 6, chroma of 4 in 7.5YR hue or\nvalues of 5 or 6, chromas ranging from 3 to 8 in 10YR hue.\nStructure is weak fine granular to moderate fine granular and\nsubangular blocky.\nThe C horizon has values ranging from 4 to 7, chromas 3 to 8 in\n5YR hue, or values ranging from 5 to 8 chromas, 2 to 8 in 7.5YR or\n10YR hue.  In some pedons it contains common limestone pebbles and\ncobbles.\nCompeting Series:  These include the Austin, Bippus, Crawford,\nDale, Denton, Frio, Krum, Lewisville, and San Saba series.  Austin\nsoils have more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in\nand immediately below the mollic epipedon.  Bippus soils have\nfine-loamy control sections.  Crawford and San Saba soils have\nintersecting slickensides and are less than 40 inches thick over\nbedrock.  Dale soils have fine-silty control sections.  Denton and\nKrum soils have coefficient of linear extensibility values of 0.09\nor greater.  Frio soils have organic matter contents that decrease\nirregularly with depth."

The\nsoil formed in calcareous clayey sediments 4 to 6 feet thick over\nlimestone.  The climate is moist subhumid to dry subhumid.  Mean\nannual precipitation ranges from about 20 to 34 inches, mean\nannual air temperature from 64 degrees to 70 degrees F, and\nThornthwaite P-E indices from 36 to 54."
