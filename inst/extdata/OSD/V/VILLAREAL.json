  "OVERVIEW": "The Villareal series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from andesite.  Villareal soils are on mesas and scarp slopes on sides of mesas.  Slopes range from 3 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 4.4 degrees C.",
