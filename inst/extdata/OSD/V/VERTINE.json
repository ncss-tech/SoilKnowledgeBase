  "OVERVIEW": "The Vertine series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in residuum from travertine.  Vertine soils are on travertine terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 450 millimeters, and the mean annual temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.",
