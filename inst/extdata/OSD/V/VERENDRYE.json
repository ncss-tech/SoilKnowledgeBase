  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 16 inches.  The average texture of the particle-size control section is typically coarse sand or loamy coarse sand, but in some pedons it is sand or loamy sand with appreciable amounts of coarse sand.  These soils have carbonates in all parts.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or less.  It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam or loamy coarse sand.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have an AC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 6 and 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  It has chromas of 3 or 4 below 30 inches in some pedons.  It has few to many redoximorphic features.  It is typically coarse sand or loamy coarse sand, but some pedons have strata that are sand or loamy sand with appreciable amounts of coarse sand.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The percent gravel ranges from 0 to about 10 percent in the C horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Verendrye soils are in depressions on glacial outwash plains and delta plains and have slope of 0 to 1 percent.  These soils formed in calcareous sandy glaciofluvial deposits of late Wisconsin age.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is from 15 to 20 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",

Fossum soils are in similar positions as the Verendrye soils.  Claire, Hecla and Lohnes soils are excessively to moderately well drained and are on higher landscape positions.  The Karlsruhe and Ulen soils have a calcic horizon and are somewhat poorly drained.  They are on slightly higher landscape positions."
