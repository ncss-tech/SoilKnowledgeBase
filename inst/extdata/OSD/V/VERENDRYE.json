  "OVERVIEW": "The Verendrye series consists of very deep, poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits.  These soils are on glacial outwash plains and delta plains and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 39 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 17 inches.",

The average texture of the particle-size control section is typically coarse sand or loamy coarse sand, but in some pedons it is sand or loamy sand with appreciable amounts of coarse sand.  These soils have carbonates in all parts.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or less.  It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam or loamy coarse sand.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have an AC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 6 and 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  It has chromas of 3 or 4 below 30 inches in some pedons.  It has few to many redoximorphic features.  It is typically coarse sand or loamy coarse sand, but some pedons have strata that are sand or loamy sand with appreciable amounts of coarse sand.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The percent gravel ranges from 0 to about 10 percent in the C horizon."
