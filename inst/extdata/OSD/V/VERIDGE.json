These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days following the summer solstice.  The volcanic ash mantle and solum is 7 to 14 inches thick with an estimated bulk density 0.80 to 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 55 percent rock fragments and 5 to 10 percent clay.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist.  It is gravelly ashy sandy loam or ashy sandy loam.  It has 5 to 20 gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe 2CB horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam or very cobbly sandy loam.  It has 25 to 35 percent gravel and 5 to 20 cobbles.\nThe 2C horizon has value 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It has 20 to 35 percent gravel and 20 to 30 percent cobbles."

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sedimentary rock with a mantle of volcanic ash 7 to 14 inches thick.  Elevations are 2,800 to 4,900 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 20 to 24 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 22 to 27 F, the average July temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F, and the average annual temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 115 days."
