  "OVERVIEW": "The Vil series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Vil soils are on fan remnants and high stream terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C.",

More study is needed of the volcanic glass content in the A horizons of this soil to adequately gauge the difference with the Blayden series."
