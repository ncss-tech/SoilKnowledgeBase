  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Valencia soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans.  Flooding is occasional, shallow and very brief.  Flooding occurs more often and is deeper on the proximal end than on the distal end of alluvial fans.  Elevations range from l00 to 2700 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in stratified and mixed alluvium that includes volcanic, granitic, metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  The mean annual precipitation is 2 to l0 inches, occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain.  The mean annual air temperature is 70 to 76 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 250 to 325 days."
