Depth to the coarse sand is 15 to 20 inches. The soils are noncalcareous above 40 inches. Some pedons have weak calcium carbonate at 50 to 60 inch depths. Very fine gravel is 5 to 15 percent. The control section is sandy loam in the upper part and coarse sand in the lower part.  The A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist; and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam. It is slightly acid or neutral. The C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR. They are neutral or mildly alkaline."
