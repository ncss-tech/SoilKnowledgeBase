The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section has 10 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  The calcic horizon has 15 to 30 percent CaCO3 calcium carbonate equivalent.  The depth to the calcic horizon is at 3 to 10 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It has 2 to 5 percent organic matter.  It has 1 to 5 percent calcium carbonate.  SAR is 1 to 5.\nThe B horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  It is silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam.  It has 10 to 18 percent clay.  SAR is 5 to 10.\nThe C horizon is loam, silt loam or fine sandy loam.  It is moderately to strongly alkaline.  It has 5 to 10 percent clay.  It has 2 to 10 percent calcium carbonates.  SAR is 5 to 10."
