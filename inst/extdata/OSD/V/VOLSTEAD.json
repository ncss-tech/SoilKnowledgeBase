    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Volstead soils occur on back slopes of dissected plateaus.  Elevations are 2,800 to 4,600 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The soil is formed in volcanic ash overlying colluvial material derived from volcanic tuffs overlying basalt.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 24 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 110 days."

Klickson soils are on steep side slopes with a planar surface shape and are loamy-skeletal.  Larabee soils are on steep side slopes with a more convex position and are loamy-skeletal.  Quirk soils are on ridges and benches with a more planar position and are moderately deep to bedrock."
