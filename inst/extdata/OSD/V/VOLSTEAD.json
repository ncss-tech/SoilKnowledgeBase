  "OVERVIEW": "The Volstead series consists of deep, well drained soils on back slopes of dissected plateaus.  Volstead soils are formed in volcanic ash overlying colluvial and residual material derived from volcanic tuffs overlying basalt.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
