    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The average annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 37 to 41 degrees F.  The average summer soil temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 70 percent rock fragments and 8 to 15 percent clay.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has chromas of 3 or 4 moist.  It is very gravelly ashy sandy loam or very cobbly ashy sandy loam.  It has 30 to 40 percent pebbles, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 3 percent stones.\nThe 2C horizon has values of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, extremely cobbly sandy loam, or very gravelly loam.  It has 30 to 45 percent pebbles, 10 to 30 percent cobbles and 5 to 10 percent stones."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Volmont soils are on upper backslopes, shoulders and ridges of mountains.  Elevations range from 4,500 to 6,000 feet.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from volcanic rock with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 35 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 18 to 22 degrees F, average July temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F, and the average annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 42 degrees F. The frost-free season is 70 to 90 days."

The Gatewall soils are on footslopes and backslopes, are very deep with a volcanic ash mantle 7 to 14 inches thick.  Venson soils are on shoulders and backslopes, and form in the red shales and sandstones of the Ventura Member of the Midnight Peak Formation.  Verhart soils are on upper backslopes, shoulders and ridges, and form in sandstone usually on southerly aspects."
