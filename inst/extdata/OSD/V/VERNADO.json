  "OVERVIEW": "The Vernado series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on escarpments on mountain slopes of mountains. These soils formed in material weathered from marine sandstone. Slope is 40 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F.",
