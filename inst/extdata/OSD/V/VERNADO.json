Central Point soils (MLRA 5), on low stream terraces and alluvial fans, are very deep, have B horizons and have 10YR color hues. Doublecreek soils (MLRA 9, 43), on toe slopes of canyons, are very deep, have B horizons and have 10YR color hues. Edmundston soils (MLRA 18, 22, 29), on mountainous uplands, are 40 to 60 inches to a paralithic contact of weathered granitic rock or granite-gneiss, have a B horizon and 10YR color hues."

The soils have formed in material weathered from marine sandstones. The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 to 24 inches. Mean January temperature is 46 degrees F; mean July temperature is 80 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 55 to 61 degrees F. The frost-free season is 180 to 220 days."
