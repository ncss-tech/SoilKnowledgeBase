  "OVERVIEW": "The Vanepps series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from serpentine with a mantle of volcanic ash.  Vanepps soils are on mountainsides and ridges and have slopes of 25 to 50 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 75 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts in the moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days during summer and fall.  The upper 7 to 10 inches has more than 60 percent volcanic ash in the fine earth fraction.\nThe A1 horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.\nThe 2Bw horizon has a hue of 5Y, 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4  moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry, 2 through 4 moist.  It is very cobbly  loam, very cobbly sandy loam, or extremely cobbly loam. It averages 15  to 35 percent pebbles and 20 to 35 percent cobbles.\nThe Cr horizon has a hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1  or 2 dry or moist.  It is a weathered bedrock that breaks to very cobbly loam  or extremely stony sandy loam.  It averages 50 to 80 percent hard serpentinite phenocryist rock fragments.  It is slightly acid to neutral."

They formed in colluvium and residuum from foliated and massive serpentinite, serpentinized peridotite and meta  serpentinite with a mantle of volcanic ash.  Elevations are 5000 to 6500 feet.   The soils are in a continental climate with cool, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 65 to 85 inches.  The mean  January temperature is about 22 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is about 56 degrees F.   The mean annual temperature is 38 to 40 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F is 80 to 110 days."
