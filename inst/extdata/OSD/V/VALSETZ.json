  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Valsetz series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy colluvium and residuum derived from basalt and other igneous and volcanic rock types. Valsetz soils are on summits, back slopes, foot slopes, and toe slopes of mountains. Slopes are 3 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 135 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist but is dry for a short period of less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 to 12 inches in the four month period following the summer solstice in moist years. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is less than 47 degrees F. with an O horizon present. The particle-size control section has a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cubic centimeter, greater than 85 percent phosphate retention, 2.0 to 4.0 percent acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, 2.0 to 10 cmol/kg of KCL-extractable aluminum, and 15 to 30 percent 15-bar moisture (air dried). It is weakly or moderately smeary. Depth to the lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The soils have 10 to 30 percent clay content by field estimate and 40 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Cobbles and stones range from 15 to 50 percent and gravel from 10 to 70 percent. Stones on the surface range from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2.5 to 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. It is stony medial loam, very stony medial loam, very gravelly medial loam, or cobbly medial loam with 20 to 25 percent apparent clay by field estimate. It has 5 to 40 percent gravel, 5 to 30 percent cobbles, and 0 to 30 percent stones. Reaction is very strongly or strongly acid. Organic matter is 10 to 20 percent.\nThe Bw horizon, and BC horizon when present, has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry. It is medial loam, medial clay loam, or medial sandy loam with 10 to 55 percent gravel, 15 to 50 percent cobbles, and 0 to 15 percent stones. Boulders range from 0 to 35 percent. It has 10 to 30 percent clay content by field estimate and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. Reaction is strongly or very strongly acid."

Where these soils are mapped in the Oregon Coast Range elevations are 2,000 to 4,100 feet. Where these soils are mapped in the Oregon Cascade Range elevations are 2,700 to 5,000 feet. Slopes are 3 to 90 percent. The soils formed in loamy colluvium and residuum derived from basalt and other igneous and volcanic rock types. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and cool moist summers. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. The mean January temperature is 31 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 55 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 200 inches. The frost-free period is typically 30 to 60 days but ranges to 100 days."

Bensley soils are more than 60 inches deep to bedrock and formed in glacial till. Cruiser soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock and have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Lurnick and Luckiamute soils are derived from sandstone and siltstone parent materials and have andic properties, but do not meet the thickness requirement for Andisols. In addition, Luckiamute soils are 14 to 20 inches deep to fractured bedrock. Maryspeak soils are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock and are sandy-skeletal. Mulkey soils have an umbric epipedon greater than 20 inches thick and have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Yellowstone soils have an umbric epipedon and are less than 20 inches deep to bedrock."
