The soils formed in material weathered from gneiss and schist. The climate is sub-humid continental, with cool, moist winters and common summer convection storms. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches, mean annual temperature is 51 to 57F; and the frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."

Competing series were not checked at that time.  ET. The classification was updated and changed from Typic Haplustolls to Aridic Haplustolls in 2006.
