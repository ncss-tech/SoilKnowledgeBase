Ackmen soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the series control section and are noncalcareous or slightly calcareous.  Alcester soils have A horizons 14 to 20 inches thick, have cambic horizons and lacks free carbonates in the series control section.  Gabaldon soils have A1 horizons that are mainly 10 to 20 inches thick and have cambic horizons.  Hord soils are slightly acid or neutral in the A and Bw horizons to depth of 40 inches, and occur in a higher precipitation zone of 19 to 24 inches. Irak soils have a seasonal water table April through September. Muir soils are medium acid to neutral in the A horizon, have cambic horizons and are noncalcareous throughout.  Coleridge, Roxbury, Shell, and Trementia soils are in LRRs G, H and M and are moist in May and June. Tobin soils are noncalcareous above depth of about 27 inches and occur in a higher precipitation zone of 20 to 28 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vega soils are on narrow valleys of entrenched intermittent streams on flood plains at elevations of 5,800 to 7,000 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from igneous and sedimentary rocks, including shale.  The mean annual temperature is about 46 to 50 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  The average freeze-free period is 120 to 140 days."
