    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days between 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 54 to 59 degrees F.  The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay and has 10 to 35 percent rock fragments.  Depth to redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less is 12 and 24 inches.  The solum is 40 to 60 inches thick and is extremely acid to very strongly acid throughout. Depth to a paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and  chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Moist values of 2 only occur within the upper 8 inches of the A horizon.  It is silt loam with 15 to 25 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent soft gravel-size rock fragments.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 moist and dry and chroma of 4 or 5 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent soft gravel-size rock fragments.\nThe Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons have hue of 2.5Y moist, 7.5YR or 10YR dry, value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 to 8 dry and chroma of 0 to 4 moist and 1 to 6 dry.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay or gravelly silty clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  It has 10 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, and 0 to 20 percent soft gravel-size rock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vondergreen soils are in depressional areas and narrow drainageways on broad ridgetops of coastal hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock of the Dothan Formation.  Elevations are 200 to 1,300 feet.  The climate is humid, characterized by warm wet winters and warm moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the dirurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 130 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 240 to 300 days."
