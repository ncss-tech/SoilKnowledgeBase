Clayburn, Crystalbutte, Davtone, Decross, Dehana, Demast, Dranburn, Dranyon, Gordo, Hagenbarth, Millerlake, Southmount, and Thulepah have bedrock at depths greater than 40 inches.  Bachus soils occur in a climate with a predominance of summer precipitation. Benteen soils have an average summer soil temperature of 45 to 52 degrees F. and have C horizons that contain 20 to 40 percent limestone rock fragments.  Bavdark soils are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock.  Cambern soils formed in ash and tuff in an area of predominately summer moisture, and have O horizons.  Echemoor and Stubbs soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.  Harmehl soils have more than 20 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon.  Senchert soils have O horizons and are neutral to mildly alkaline in the Bt horizon.  Squawval soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.  Winu soils have 20 to 35 percent rock fragments in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vadnais soils are on basalt plains at elevations of 5,300 to 6,900 feet.  Slopes are 1 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in loess and eolian sands influenced by valley side alluvium.  Average annual precipitation is 18 to 26 inches.  Most of this precipitation comes in the winter and spring months.  Average annual air temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F and the average summer air temperature is 55 to 58 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 40 to 80 days."

The Fourme soils are moderately deep to sand and gravel and occupy lower outwash plains.  The Sudpeak soils are fine, montmorillonitic and moderately-well drained occurring on lower outwash plains and flood plains.  Katseanes soils are shallow and are adjacent to pressure ridges or rock outcrops.  Pinebutte soils have a layer of calcium carbonate accumulation in the substratum and are in concavities.   Hagenbarth soils are deep and in concavities."
