  "OVERVIEW": "The Vadnais series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and eolian sand influenced by local alluvium.  Vadnais soils are on basalt plains.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes range from 1 to 50 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

Clayburn, Crystalbutte, Davtone, Decross, Dehana, Demast, Dranburn, Dranyon, Gordo, Hagenbarth, Millerlake, Southmount, and Thulepah have bedrock at depths greater than 40 inches.  Bachus soils occur in a climate with a predominance of summer precipitation. Benteen soils have an average summer soil temperature of 45 to 52 degrees F. and have C horizons that contain 20 to 40 percent limestone rock fragments.  Bavdark soils are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock.  Cambern soils formed in ash and tuff in an area of predominately summer moisture, and have O horizons.  Echemoor and Stubbs soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.  Harmehl soils have more than 20 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon.  Senchert soils have O horizons and are neutral to mildly alkaline in the Bt horizon.  Squawval soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.  Winu soils have 20 to 35 percent rock fragments in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon."

Katseanes soils are shallow and are adjacent to pressure ridges or rock outcrops.  Pinebutte soils have a layer of calcium carbonate accumulation in the substratum and are in concavities.   Hagenbarth soils are deep and in concavities."
