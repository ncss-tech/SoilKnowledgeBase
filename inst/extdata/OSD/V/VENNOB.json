  "OVERVIEW": "The Vennob series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium dominantly from igneous rocks.  Vennob soils are on mountain slopes and have slopes of 15 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F.\nThese soils are noncalcareous throughout.  Depth to the lithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The particle size control section has 35 to 40 percent clay. The igneous rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 50 percent and are dominantly gravel and cobble size. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline throughout.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 10 inches thick when mixed and includes part but not all of the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is a very gravelly loam.  Rock fragment content is 35 to 60 percent.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is a very cobbly loam or very gravelly clay loam.  Rock fragment content is 35 to 50 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is a very cobbly clay loam or very gravelly clay loam.  Rock fragment content is 35 to 50 percent."

Ateron soils have 40 to 50 percent clay in the particle size control section. Camool soils contain 7 to 25 percent volcanic glass in the top 5 to 9 inches and have 2Bt horizons.  Canest soils have bedrock at 5 to 10 inches, and the mollic epipedon includes the entire soil.  Chen soils have 40 to 55 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Douhide soils have an aridic soil moisture regime and are dry for 90 or more consecutive days during the summer and fall.  Graley soils have mollic epipedons that do not include any part of the argillic horizon.  Harlow soils have mollic colors throughout the Bt horizon.  Itca soils have an abrupt boundary between the A and Bt horizon.  Wallsburg soils have more than 50 percent cobbles and stones in the particle size control section."
