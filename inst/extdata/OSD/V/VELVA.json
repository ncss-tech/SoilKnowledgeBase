  "OVERVIEW": "The Velva series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately or moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in stratified recent alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains and low terraces and have slopes of 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 41 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 16 inches.",

Some pedons contain carbonates throughout.  Saline phases are recognized.  The soil commonly has one or more buried A horizons.  Some pedons have an O horizon.\nThe A horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It commonly is loam or fine sandy loam but some is sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or clay loam.  Some pedons have Bw horizons.\nThe C horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It averages fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loam; some pedons have thin layers of coarser or finer material.  It commonly contains carbonates and some pedons have Bk horizons."
