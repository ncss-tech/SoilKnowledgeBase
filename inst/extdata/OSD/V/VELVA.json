  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages between 7 and 18 percent clay and 25 and 60 percent fine sand or coarser.  Some pedons contain carbonates throughout.  Saline phases are recognized.  The soil commonly has one or more buried A horizons.  Some pedons have an O horizon.\nThe A horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It commonly is loam or fine sandy loam but some is sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or clay loam.  Some pedons have Bw horizons.\nThe C horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It averages fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loam; some pedons have thin layers of coarser or finer material.  It commonly contains carbonates and some pedons have Bk horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Velva soils are on flood plains and low terraces.  Slope gradients typically are less than 2 percent, but range to 6 percent along channels and edges of terraces.  The soils formed in stratified recent alluvium.  Mean annual temperatures range from 38 degrees to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 12 to 20 inches.  Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer."

Havrelon, Korchea, Straw, and Trembles soils are on similar landscapes.  Farland, Parshall, Savage, Shambo, Stady, and Tally soils are on nearby higher terraces.  All have a regular decrease in organic matter with depth."
