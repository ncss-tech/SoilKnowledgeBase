  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 60 to 110 inches.\nThickness of the epipedon is 40 to 80 inches.  It is very gravelly sand or very gravelly loamy sand or their gravelly counterparts.  It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.  The A horizon is brown (7.5YR 5/2, 5/4; 10YR 5/3), pale brown (10YR 6/3), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2).  Siliceous pebbles and cobbles comprise 40 to 85 percent by volume.\nThe E horizon is 1 to 2 units of value higher than the A horizon.\nThe dominant color in the matrix of the Bt horizon is light gray (10YR 7/1, 7/2), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), pale brown (10YR 6/3), brown (10YR 5/3), yellowish red (5YR 5/6, 4/6), or red (2.5YR 4/6, 4/8, 5/6, 5/8) with mottles or a mottled matrix in shades of red, gray, yellow, and brown.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly sandy clay loam or their extremely gravelly counterparts.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon contains 18 to 32 percent clay in the fine-earth fraction and 35 to 80 percent pebbles and cobbles.  It is medium acid through very strongly acid.\nThe C horizon is mottled red, gray and yellow gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam, gravelly sandy clay loam, or very gravelly sandy clay loam.  Red acid sandstone with a hardness of 2 to 3 on the Moh's scale occurs at depths of 7 to 10 feet in some pedons."

All these soils except Hornsby have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  In addition, Arenosa soils lack Bt horizons, Boy soils are not dry in any part of the moisture control section for 90 cumulative days in most years, Nimrod soils have a sandy epipedon less than 40 inches thick, Patilo soils are more than 90 percent by weight of silica minerals, and Sarita soils have a mean average soil temperature more than 72 degrees F.  Hornsby soils have an epipedon less than 20 inches thick."

The soils were formed on ancient stream terraces in thick beds of sand and gravel which contained thin strata of finer material.  Climate is subhumid.  Annual precipitation is 28 to 40 inches, Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 40 to 55, mean average temperature is 67 to 70 degrees F."

In addition, Bonti soils have sandstone within 40 inches of the surface.  The soils occur at lower elevations."
