Surface stones increase near areas of rock outcrop.  The rock fragments consist of angular to subangular gravel, cobbles, and stones.  The upper part of the control section has estimated phosphate retention of 60 to 90 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.5 to 3.0 percent, 20 to 50 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregate, and 5 to 18 percent field estimated clay.  The lower part has less than 5 percent volcanic glass and 15 to 30 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 to 6 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is ashy fine sandy loam with 5 to 15 percent clay and 20 to 65 percent total rock fragments.
