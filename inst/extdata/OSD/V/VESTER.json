  "OVERVIEW": "The Vester series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils on side slopes of mountains.  Vester soils formed in volcanic ash and basalt colluvium overlying basalt colluvium.  Slopes are 10 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

The lower part has less than 5 percent volcanic glass and 15 to 30 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 to 6 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is ashy fine sandy loam with 5 to 15 percent clay and 20 to 65 percent total rock fragments.
