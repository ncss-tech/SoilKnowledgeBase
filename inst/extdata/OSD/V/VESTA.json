  "OVERVIEW": "The Vesta series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material from deeply weathered basalt.  Vesta soils are on mountainous uplands and have slopes of 1 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 90 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The A and Bw horizons have bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cc., phosphate retention of 85 to 95 percent and acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron of 2 to 4 percent.  Acid oxalate iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.  The 15-bar water content is 15 to 25 percent on air dried samples.  Soil reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.  The umbric epipedon, when present, is 10 to 16 inches thick; ochric epipedons are present in some pedons and moist chroma is 4 above 10 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  It has 10 to 15 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw and 2Bw horizons have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  The Bw horizon is medial silt loam or medial silty clay loam with 15 to 30 percent field estimated clay.  It has 1 to 10 percent organic matter with less than 7 percent below 20 inches.  It has 2 to 3 cmol/kg of aluminum.  The 2Bw horizon is silty clay, clay loam or silty clay loam with 35 to 55 percent clay."
