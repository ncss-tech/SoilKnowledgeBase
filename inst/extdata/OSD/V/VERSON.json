  "OVERVIEW": "The Verson series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous clayey alluvium over very gravelly or extremely gravelly alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
