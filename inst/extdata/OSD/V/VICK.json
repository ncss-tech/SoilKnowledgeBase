  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from\n50 to about 80 inches.  Depth to clayey IIB horizons ranges from\n20 to 35 inches.  The A and B horizons above the IIB horizon have\n3 to 10 percent total sand content.\nThe A1 or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma\nof 2 to 4.  The A2 horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value\nof 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Reaction ranges from very\nstrongly acid to medium acid.\nThe B1 and B2t horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 5, and chroma\nof 4 to 6.  Typically, the texture is silt loam, but silty clay\nloam is within the range.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid\nto medium acid.  Mottles in shades of gray and brown range from\nfew to many.\nThe B part of the B&A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6,\nand chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The A\npart of the B&A horizon is a grayish uncoated silt.\nThe IIBt horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and\nchroma of 2, 4, or 6.  It is clay or silty clay in the upper part\nand silty clay loam in the lower part.  Reaction ranges from very\nstrongly acid to medium acid.\nThe IIIBt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of\n2 to 6.  It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.  Reaction\nranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nCompeting Series:  These are the Longview series in the same\nfamily and the Coteau, Egypt, Fred, Frizzell, Glenmora,\nKeithville, Kolin, Metcalf, and Vidrine series.  Coteau, Egypt,\nFred, Frizzell, Glenmora, and Longview soils lack clayey IIB\nhorizons.  Keithville and Kolin soils do not have low chroma\nmottles in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  Metcalf\nsoils have more than 15 percent sand in all horizons above the\nclayey IIB horizon.  Vidrine soils have coarse-silty over clayey\ncontrol sections and are on mounds."

The soils formed in a thin layer of loess over clayey\nand loamy Coastal Plains sediments.  The climate is warm and\nhumid.  The mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F., and\nthe mean annual rainfall is about 61 inches near the type\nlocation."

Guyton and Wrightsville soils are in shallow\ndepressions and are dominantly gray throughout the solum.\nDrainage and Permeability:  Vick soils are somewhat poorly\ndrained.  Runoff is slow and permeability is slow.  A perched\nseasonally high water table is at a depth of 0.5 to 2 feet for\nperiods of 8 to 16 weeks during December through April."
