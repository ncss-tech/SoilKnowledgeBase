  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The range in characteristics includes 50 percent or more of the pedon.  Solum thickness and depth to a paralithic contact with shale ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  Weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 60 to 76 percent.  When dry, cracks 0.5 to 1.5 inches wide extend to the C horizon.  Cracks remain open 90 to 150 cumulative days in most years.  Undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microlows 2 to 6 feet wide and 2 to 8 inches deep.  The linear microhighs, 10 to 16 feet wide, extend up and down slopes.\nThe A horizon has color with hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Reaction ranges from neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bss horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Mottles in shades of brown or red range from none to common.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Gypsum crystals range from few to common.  Some pedons contain a few fine calcium carbonate nodules.\nThe Cr layer is a shale with varigated colors in shades of gray, brown, red, or yellow.  Crystals of gypsum range from few to common in most pedons."

Anhalt and Crawford soils have hue of 7.5YR and redder and have a lithic contact to limestone bedrock.  Crawford, Dalco, Greenvine, and San Saba soils have a fine particle-size control section.  In addition, Dalco, Greenvine, and San Saba soils have chroma of 1 to a depth of 12 inches or more."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vertel soils are on gently sloping to strongly sloping uplands.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  Surfaces are convex.  The soil formed in clayey marine shales of the Eagle Ford Formation of Upper Cretaceous Age.  Mean annual precipitation is 30 to 42 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 64 degrees to 68 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 225 to 235.  Elevation ranges from 450 to 850 feet above sea level.  The Thornthwaite P-E index is 52 to 64."

Altoga and Lewisville soils have fine-silty control sections, and are on terrace scarps lower in the landscape.  In addition Altoga soils have carbonatic mineralogy.  Ferris and Heiden soils have less than 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are on similar positions of adjacent areas with different parent material."
