Avenal soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the control section, total sand in the profile ranges from 25 to 35 percent, formed from sedimentary parent material, and is located on the westside of the San Joaquin Valley, California. Avenal, Bryman, Garlock, Milham and Neuralia soils do not receive appreciable summer precipitation and are dry in the soil moisture control section during summer. Bigred soils do not have an osd. Anway, Bucklebar and Palomas soils are moist in the soil moisture control section for more than 20 cumulative days between July and September.
