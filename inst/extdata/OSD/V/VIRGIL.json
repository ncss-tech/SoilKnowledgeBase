  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Virgil soils are nearly level or gently sloping low broad summits on outwash plains, stream terraces, and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. These soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess or other silty sediments and in the underlying loamy outwash or sandy loam till. The dominant clay mineral in the loess is smectite, and in the outwash or till is illite. Summers are hot and winters are cold.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 6.7 to 12.2 degrees C (44 to 54 degrees F).  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 760 to 1070 mm (30 to 42 inches).  Frost-free days range from 120 to 190 days."

The well drained Batavia soils are on adjacent, slightly higher parts of the landscape. The poorly drained Drummer soils are on lower parts of the landscape and have a mollic epipedon.  Elburn soils have a mollic epipedon and are on similar parts of the landscape nearby but generally are on broad landscape areas farther from the drainageways.  Emery soils are on adjacent dissected till plains and average less than 20 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.  The well drained Harvard soils are on adjacent, slightly higher parts of the landscape and formed in loess less than 102 cm (40 inches) thick.  Kendall soils are on similar parts of the landscape nearby but generally are adjacent to or nearer the drainageways and do not have a dark colored surface layer.  Millbrook soils are on similar parts of the stream terraces and outwash plains where the loess is thinner. The well drained Plano soils have a mollic epipedon and are on adjacent, slightly higher parts of the landscape. The well drained St. Charles soils are on adjacent, slightly higher parts of the landscape and do not have dark colored surface layer.  The poorly drained Thorp soils have a mollic epipedon and are on lower parts of the landscape."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. An intermittent apparent high water table is at a depth of 31 to 61 cm (1.0 to 2.0 feet) below the surface in most years.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the upper part of the solum and high (14.11 to 42.34 micrometers per second) in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of solum and ranges moderate to moderately rapid in the lower part. The potential for surface runoff is low to medium as related to slope."
