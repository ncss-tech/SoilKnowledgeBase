  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. CEM/TLP/LWH",
  "REVDATE": "12/2008",
  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Venadito series consists of deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium, fan alluvium, and stream alluvium derived from shale. Venadito soils are on alluvial fans on valley sides, low stream terraces, and flood plains on valley floors. Slope is 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
