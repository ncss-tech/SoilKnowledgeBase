    "content": "REMARKS: These soils formerly were included with the Midland series.  Classification changed from Vertic Ochraqualfs to Chromic Vertic Epiaqualfs 11/2000 based on typifying pedon description. Another classification change from Chromic Vertic Epiaqualfs to Oxyaquic Vertic Hapludalfs based on new version of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Further study and characterization data of the series is needed to verify hydrology and classification.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in) (A horizon)\nArgillic Horizon: 15 to 152 cm (6 to 60 in) (Btg horizons)\nVertic features: COLE more than 0.09 in upper 102 cm (40 in)\nADDITIONAL DATA: none\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
