  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness to limestone or  interbedded limestone, marl, and shale range from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Texture of the soil is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam with a silicate clay content of 18 to 35 percent in the 10 to 40 inch control section and less than 15 percent is coarser than very fine sand.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 30 to 70 percent, and increases with depth and averages 40 to 60 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  When moist values and chromas are less than 3.5, the horizon is less than 7 inches thick.  Few to common pebbles of black concretions, limestone, siltstone, caliche, and shale are on the surface and in the soil.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 4. Soft masses and hard concretions of secondary calcium carbonate are about equally distributed in the Bk horizon and range from about 5 to 50 percent by volume.  The B horizons of some pedons contain a few limestone pebbles, siltstone, calcium carbonate masses, and shale fragments.\nThe R layer ranges from indurated limestone to interbedded  limestone, marl, and shale.\nCompeting Series:  This is the only series in the family.  Other competitors include the Hoban, Hodgins, McAllen, Midessa, Ratliff, Reagan, and Reakor series.  These series are not in the carbonatic family.  Hoban soils have gypsum at depth of 40 to 60 inches are not underlain by limestone at depths of less than 60 inches.  Hodgins soils contain less than 5 percent of visible segregated calcium carbonate within depths of 40 inches.  McAllen soils contain more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the 10 to 40 inch control section, lack calcic horizons within 40 inches of the surface, and have mean annual soil temperatures  greater than 72 degrees F.  Midessa and Ratliff soils contain more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the 10 to 40 inch control section.  Reakor and Reagan soils have sola more than 60 inches thick.  In addition, Reakor soils are dry for longer  periods."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Valverde soils are in filled valleys and on limestone plateaus.  They have developed in loamy sediments of Cretaceous age.  Slope gradients are mainly 1 to 2 percent, but range from 0 to 3 percent.  The climate is semiarid.  Average annual rainfall ranges from 12 to 20 inches and mean annual temperatures from 65 to 70 degrees F.  Frost free period is 265 to 305 days, and elevation ranges from 900 to 1800 feet. Thornthwaite P-E indices from 16 to 32."

Nuvalde soils have sola more than 40 inches thick. Reagan and Nuvalde soils occur on similar surfaces.  The other soils occur at higher elevations and have higher surface gradients."
