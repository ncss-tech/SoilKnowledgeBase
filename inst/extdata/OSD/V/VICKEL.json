The Casmos soils have a lithic contact with sandstone at less than 50 cm and occur on caps of shale hills and on dissected structural benches under black sagebrush.  The Chipeta and Persayo soils are shallow to weathered bedrock on adjacent hillslopes.  Ravola soils are very deep, stratified, and occur on alluvial flats or terraces downslope of the Vickel soils.  Sagers and Utaline soils are very deep and are on toeslopes of shale hills and fan remnants."
