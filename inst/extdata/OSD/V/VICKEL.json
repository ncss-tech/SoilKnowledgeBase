  "OVERVIEW": "The Vickel series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from calcareous shale and sandstone.  Vickel soils are on shale hills and dissected pediments.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
