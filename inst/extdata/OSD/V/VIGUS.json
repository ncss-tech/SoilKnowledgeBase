  "OVERVIEW": "The Vigus series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Vigus soils are on fan remnants, alluvial fans, and fan skirts. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
