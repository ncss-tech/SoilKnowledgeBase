  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and the depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Thickness of the loess is 15 to 40 inches.  Volume of chert fragments in the loess ranges from 0 to 15 percent and from 0 to 35 percent in the clay residuum.  Volume of chert fragments larger than 3 inches in size ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the pedon.  The solum is leached of free carbonates to a depth greater than 60 inches.  The solum in the upper part (loess) is strongly acid to neutral and in the lower part (residuum) is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Ap or A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nWhere present, the A horizon is 3 to 5 inches thick.  Where present, the E horizon has 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bt horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon typically has 5YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 8.  Less commonly it has hue of 2.5YR and value of 3 through 7.  Some pedons have layers in the 2B with hue of 10YR.  In some pedons individual subhorizons in the residuum have variegated colors that include pockets or discontinuous lenses with chroma of 2.  These low chroma colors reflect the color of the parent material from which they weathered.  Some pedons have high chroma mottles in the subsoil and some pedons have low chroma mottles below a depth of 36 inches due to wetness.  The 2Bt horizon is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or the channery or flaggy analogues.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 75 percent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The only other soil in this family is the Pembroke series.  Pembroke soils do not have a distinct loess mantle and typically have redder hues in the upper part of the solum.  Similar soils in other families are Baylis, NewGlarus, Norwalk, Palsgrove, Southridge, and Wildale series.  Baylis soils do not have a dark colored surface and contain more chert fragments in the lower part of the sola.  NewGlarus and Norwalk soils are underlain by dolomite at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Palsgrove soils have a thicker loess mantle and are underlain by dolomite at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Southridge soils are similar but have a lighter colored surface and have contrasting textures.  Wildale soils have a thinner loess mantle overlying the clayey residuum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Valton soils are on ridgetops and side slopes (shoulder and back slopes) in dissected uplands underlain by thick clayey residuum over limestone.  Slope gradients commonly are 2 to 20 percent but ranges from 1 to 45 percent.  These soils formed in 15 to 40 inches of loess and in the underlying clayey residuum weathered from limestone. Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 49 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches."

All of these soils are in similar landscape positions, but their differences, which lie below the surface, are not apparent in the landscape, except that the Valton soils occur commonly on broad, high interfluves or divides."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Valton soils were at one time included with the NewGlarus soils.  Prior to the establishment of the NewGlarus soils they were included with the Dubuque soils.  Refer to National Soil Survey Laboratory numbers 77P218-77P2186 for data on the typical pedon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 9 inches (Ap horizon); argillic horizon - zone from 9 to 60 inches (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, 2Bt5, and 2Bt6 horizons); clay distribution that does not decrease from its maximum amount by as much as 20 percent of that maximum within a depth of 1.5 m from the soil surface, hue redder than 10YR and chroma more than 4 dominant in the matrix of at least the lower part of the argillic horizon; udic moisture regime; mesic temperature regime.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Taxonomic placement of Valton pedons hinges on the texture of the upper part of the residuum.  The amount of clay will vary because of the amount of erosion that had occurred on the surface prior to loess deposition.  Some pedons can be placed in fine-silty over clayey and some in fine-silty.  The use and management, however, is the same.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
