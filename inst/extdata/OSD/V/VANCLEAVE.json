  "OVERVIEW": "The Vancleave series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that have nodular plinthite and a fragipan.  They formed in thick beds of unconsolidated loamy sediments.  They are on terraces of Pleistocene age in the Gulf Coast Flatwoods Major Land Resource Area and on uplands of Pliocene age in the Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.",
