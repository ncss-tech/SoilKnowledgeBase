Series in closely related families include the Basin, Baxterville, Brewton, Desota, Escambia, Florala, Irvington, and Prentiss series. Basin soils are somewhat poorly drained and do not have a fragipan.  Baxterville soils are fine-loamy and do not have a fragipan.  Brewton soils are somewhat poorly drained, do not have a fragipan, and have less than 5 percent plinthite within 60 inches of the surface.  Desota soils are fine-loamy.  Escambia and Florala soils are somewhat poorly drained and and do not have fragic properties.  Prentiss soils do not have plinthite within 60 inches of the surface.  Irvington soils are fine-loamy."

They are on terraces of Pleistocene age in the Gulf Coast Flatwoods MLRA and on uplands of Pliocene age in the Southern Coastal Plain MLRA.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 64 to 70 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 56 to 64 inches.  Annual frost-free days range from 230 to 260."
