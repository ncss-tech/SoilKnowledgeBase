  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mollic epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick.  Depth to duripan is 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 62 to 63 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of about 7 and 22 inches is dry in all parts from June to October and moist in all parts from December to April.  Distinct to prominent mottles at depths of 30 or more inches.  The texture control section from a depth of 10 to 40 inches is 5 to 16 percent clay.  The soil is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  In some pedons there is an overwash of silty clay loam 15 to 19 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 5/1, 5/2 or 4/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2 or 3/1.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 2 percent.\nThe Bw and Bk horizon has color of 10YR 5/4, 5/3, 5/1, 6/3, 6/4, 6/2 or 2.5Y 6/2 and moist color of 10YR 4/3, 4/2, 4/1 or 2.5Y 4/2.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bqm horizon is a duripan that is strongly cemented to indurated in the laminar capping.  In most pedons the cemented material is less calcareous with depth and is noncalcareous in some pedons.  The silica cementation within the layer ranges from 50 to 90 percent.  Some pedons have continuous silica cementation at or near the upper boundary in laminar layers."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Acampo, Pfeiffer, San Andreas, Tagus , Tokay and Walong series.  Pfeiffer soils have a paralithic contact at 40 to 70 inches.  San Andreas and Walong series have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Tagus soils have an A and Bk thickness of more than 60 inches.  Acampo and Tokay soils lack calcium carbonate.  In addition, Tokay soils do not have pedogenic silica within 60 inches.\nGEOGRAPHIC SETTING;  Veritas soils are on low fan terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  Elevations are 20 to 75 feet.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 11 to 12 inches.  Mean January temperature is 45 degrees F; mean July temperature is 77 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 60 to 61 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 260 to 270 days."
