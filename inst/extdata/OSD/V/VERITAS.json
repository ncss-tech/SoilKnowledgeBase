  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mollic epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick.  Depth to duripan is 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 62 to 63 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of about 7 and 22 inches is dry in all parts from June to October and moist in all parts from December to April.  Distinct to prominent mottles at depths of 30 or more inches.  The texture control section from a depth of 10 to 40 inches is 5 to 16 percent clay.  The soil is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  In some pedons there is an overwash of silty clay loam 15 to 19 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 5/1, 5/2 or 4/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2 or 3/1.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 2 percent.\nThe Bw and Bk horizon has color of 10YR 5/4, 5/3, 5/1, 6/3, 6/4, 6/2 or 2.5Y 6/2 and moist color of 10YR 4/3, 4/2, 4/1 or 2.5Y 4/2.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bqm horizon is a duripan that is strongly cemented to indurated in the laminar capping.  In most pedons the cemented material is less calcareous with depth and is noncalcareous in some pedons.  The silica cementation within the layer ranges from 50 to 90 percent.  Some pedons have continuous silica cementation at or near the upper boundary in laminar layers."

San Andreas and Walong series have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Tagus soils have an A and Bk thickness of more than 60 inches.  Acampo and Tokay soils lack calcium carbonate.  In addition, Tokay soils do not have pedogenic silica within 60 inches."
