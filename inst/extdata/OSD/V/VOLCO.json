    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Volco soils are on hills or mountains formed by the dissection of igneous materials.  Slopes range from 1 percent to about 45 percent.  They formed in calcareous loamy sediments that have accumulated in the stony mantle of igneous materials.  Underlying bedrock is hard; being mainly of rhyolitic or basaltic volcanic.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 20 inches the majority comes in the summer months.  Mean annual air temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 200 to 240 days and elevation ranges from 4,000 to 6,695 feet."
