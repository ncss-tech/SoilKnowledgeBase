  "OVERVIEW": "The Vision series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from igneous, argillite, metamorphic, and sedimentary rock.  These soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
