  "OVERVIEW": "The Vadaho series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in a layer of loess influenced by volcanic ash overlying alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  The Vadaho soils are on fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
