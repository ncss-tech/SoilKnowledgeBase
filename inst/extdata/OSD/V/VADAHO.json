These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with some influence from a surface mantle of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,590 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid, with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to l20 days."
