  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Vanpetten soils are on convex slopes of gently undulating till plains that have thin deposits of loamy and sandy sediments. Slope gradients range from 1 to 5 percent. These soils formed in 46 to 89 cm (18 to 35 inches) of loamy eolian sediments and 31 to 91 cm (12 to 36 inches) of watersorted sandy sediments and in the underlying till that contains a paleosol. The till is believed to be of Illinoian age with a late Sangamon paleosol formed in it. In some places it was partially truncated or eroded prior to deposition of the sandy and loamy sediments. The truncation of the paleosol and the origin of the sandy sediments is believed to be the result of glacial meltwaters from the nearby Shelbyville morainic system or the Bloomington morainic system. Mean annual precipitation varies from 813 to 914 mm (32 to 36 inches), and mean annual temperature varies from 8.9 to 10.6 degrees C (48 to 51 degrees F)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Dakota soils and the Binghampton, Nachusa, Prairieville, and Sparta soils. The well drained Dakota soils are on similar nearby areas where the sandy sediments extend to depths of 152 cm (60 inches) or more. The somewhat poorly drained Binghampton and Nachusa soils commonly are downslope from Vanpetten soils and contain redox features higher in the solum. In addition, Nachusa soils lack coarse textured horizons and Binghampton soils lack a mollic epipedon. The moderately well drained Prairieville soils occupy positions similar to Vanpetten soils but have more clay in the B horizon and lack coarse textured horizons. The excessively drained Sparta soils are sandy throughout the solum and are on higher dune-shaped ridges."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Runoff is medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the loamy sediments, very high (141.14 micrometers per second or more) in the sandy sediments, and moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the paleosolic horizons.  Permeability is moderate in the loamy sediments, very rapid in the sandy sediments, and moderately slow in the paleosolic horizons. Water commonly is perched above the paleosolic horizon during winter and spring months."
