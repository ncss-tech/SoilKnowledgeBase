  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments commonly range from 20 to 35 percent in the surface horizon and 35 to 65 percent in the subsoil and subtratum but the range includes subhorizons with a lower limit of 25 percent in the control section. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout the soil.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. It is channery or gravelly silt loam or loam. It has weak or moderate fine or medium granular structure and consistence is friable or very friable. Where present, the Ap horizon can range up to 12 inches thick.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 3 through 6. It is very channery or very gravelly loam or silt loam. It has weak or moderate, fine subangular blocky or granular structure. Some pedons have platy structure in the lower Bw horizon. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with properties similar to the B or C horizons.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is very channery or very gravelly loam or silt loam. Consistence is very friable or friable."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Mosinee, Saddlepack, and Threetrees series are in the same family. Mosinee does not have a lithic contact between 20 and 40 inches. The Saddlepeak and Threetrees have hues of 7.5YR or yellower in the cambic horizon.\nThe Cadosia, Halcott and Mongaup series are similar soils in related families. Cadosia soils are more than 60 inches deep to bedrock and have a mesic temperature regime. Halcott soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to bedrock. Mongaup soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments throughout."

These soils formed in reddish till that is derived from reddish sandstone, siltstone and shale. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 47 to 52 inches; mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 90-110 days.
