  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Vananda soils are usually dry when not frozen, unless irrigated, and they have a mean annual soil temperature of 48 to 52 degrees F.  The continuous surface crust is 1/8 to 1/2 inch thick under sparse grass cover, and 1/2 to 1 inch thick under greasewood and saltbush plants, in animal hoof tracks and in cultivated fields.  The thicker crust under greasewood and saltbush is contrasting in appearance in its lighter color of the dry soil surface with more abundant clear silt covering in the crust.  Beneath the crust the A12 horizon ranges in structure from moderate to strong fine to medium plates to strong very fine granules.  It differs in color from the underlying horizons by less than 1 unit in Munsell value. The soil below the A12 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or yellower, value of 6 or 5 dry and 5 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It ranges from moderate medium blocky to massive with widely spaced (6 to 10 inches) vertical cracks appearing in the dry soil.  It has 45 to 60 percent clay.  Quantities of gypsum crystals range from many to very few.  The exchangeable sodium percentage is greater than 7 and increases to more than 15 at about 20 inches, and the electrical conductivity exceeds 2 mhs per cm.  The soil profile ranges from very slightly to moderately calcareous with a few (less than 1 percent) fine or medium segregations of lime below the A12 horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bone, Gaynor, Kyle, Limon (tentative), Pierre, Swanboy and Vanda (tentative) series. Bone soils have white silt-coated, crusted, barren surfaces and salt flocculated granular horizons beneath the very thin sodic argillic horizons.  Gaynor, Kyle, Limon, Pierre, and Swanboy soils have granular surfaces, and Gaynor and Pierre soils have paralithic contacts between 20 and 40 inches. Vanda soils have mean annual soil temperature of 40 to 47 degrees F.  Gaynor, Kyle, Limon and Pierre soils have less than 15 percent exchangeable sodium."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nearly level to sloping or gently rolling upland or valley plains on residual or transported clay surfaces.  Local relief ranges up to 20 feet with long smooth slopes 300 to more than 1,000 feet long.  Slopes are short (50 to 200 feet) where associated with the Lismas soils on hilly terrain.  The climate is cool semiarid with mean annual temperature of 45 to 47 degrees F., mean summer temperature more than 60 degrees F. and mean winter temperature between 18 and 28 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches."
