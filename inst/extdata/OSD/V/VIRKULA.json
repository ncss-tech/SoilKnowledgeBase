  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Content of coarse fragments as pebbles and channers of rock ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the solum and ranges up to 60 percent at depths below 40 inches.  Depth to consolidated bedrock typically is greater than 60 inches but ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  The soil is leached of carbonates throughout.  Worm working is common in the upper 4 inches of the profile.  The sand fraction is dominantly very fine sand in the B/E and Bt horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is a loam or silt loam and contains up to 15 percent pebbles and channers less than 3 inches.  It ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is a silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam and contains up to 10 percent pebbles and channers less than 3 inches.  It ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe B/E horizon has colors of the B2t and E horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.  The Bt horizon averages 20 to 35 percent clay and contains up to 10 percent pebbles and channers less than 3 inches.  It ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 3 to 5.  It typically is clay loam, silty clay loam, loam or silt loam and contains up to 35 percent pebbles and channers.  It ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon, if present, has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 7; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam or loam, and contains 10 to 60 percent pebbles and channers.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Greenough and Half Moon series. The Greenough soils typically contain more coarse fragments and formed in colluvium from sedimentary rocks of Tertiary Age.  The Half Moon series has an accumulation of carbonates below the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Virkula soils are on gently sloping to steep mountains at elevations of 3600 and 6200 feet.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 35 percent.  These soils formed in silty materials weathered from igenous and metamorphic rocks.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 26 inches."

Buska soils contain more mica and coarse fragments.  The Citadel soils have a fine-textured argillic horizon.  Pactola soils contain more coarse fragments.  The Grizzly, Hisega, and Vanocker soils typically are steeper and contain more coarse fragments.  In addition, Hisega soils contain more mica and Vanocker soils contain carbonates."

A large increase of 46,000 acres is in Custer and Pennington Counties.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 12 inches (A and E horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from about 12 to 36 inches (B/E, Bt1, Bt2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL Lab No. BlP66-71 for the typical pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
