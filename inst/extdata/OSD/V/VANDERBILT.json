These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 100 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Organic matter is estimated to range from 1 to 3 percent.  The particle-size control section has 27 to 32 percent clay and more than 5 percent fine sand or coarser.  Base saturation is more than 75 percent.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is more than 60 inches.\nThe Ap and A horizons have value of 3 or 4 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bt horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist."
