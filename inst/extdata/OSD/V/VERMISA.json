The soils are usually moist but are dry throughout the moisture control section for 45 to 90 days following the summer solstice.  The thickness of the solum and depth to hard fractured bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments of metasedimentary, metavolcanic rock range from 35 to 55 percent gravel and 0 to 25 percent cobbles.  The hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.   It is gravelly loam or very gravelly loam with 10 to 20 percent clay.  It has 15 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly loam, or very gravelly silt loam with 18 to 27 percent clay.  It has 35 to 55 percent gravel and 0 to 25 percent cobbles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Vermisa soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks.  The climate is characterized by cool moist to wet winters and hot and dry summers. Mean January temperature is 40 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 67 degrees F., the mean annual temperature is 45 to 57 degrees F. The frost-free period season is 100 to 235 days.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches but may range to 100 inches in areas of high winter rainfall of Curry County, Oregon."
