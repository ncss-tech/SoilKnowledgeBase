  "OVERVIEW": "The Vallegold series consists of shallow to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granitoid. The Vallegold soils are on rock pediments. Slopes range from 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 225 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C.",
