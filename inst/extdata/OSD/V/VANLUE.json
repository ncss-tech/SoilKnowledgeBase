Centerburg soils have rock fragments dominantly of sandstone and shale lithology. Cygnet and Houcktown soils have a densic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Jenera soils do not have iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less on faces of peds in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Jugtown soils have rock fragments of sandstone, chert, and shale lithology. Nicely, Scattersville, and Swampoodle soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 127 cm (50 inches). Reaville soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Tuscola soils do not have rock fragments within the series control section.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Vanlue soils are on lake plains and in shallow lacustrine areas on till plains of late Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Vanlue soils formed in stratified loamy and silty glaciolacustrine material 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) thick and in the underlying till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 914 mm (27 to 36 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 165 days. Elevation is 213 to 244 meters (700 to 800 feet) above mean sea level."

The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and glaciolacustrine substratum, and moderately low in the till substratum. Permeability is moderate in the glaciolacustrine material, moderately slow in the lower part of the solum and in the glaciolacustrine substratum, and moderately slow or slow in the till substratum."
