  "STATES": "OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Vinita series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed from shales interbedded with thin layers of sandstone of Pennsylvanian age.  These soils are on ridges and side slopes on uplands in the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).  Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 1016 millimeters (40 inches) and mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).",
