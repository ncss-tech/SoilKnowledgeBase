  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vinita soils are on very gently sloping to steep ridges and side slopes of uplands in the Cherokee Prairies.  They formed in shales interbedded with thin layers of sandstone of Pennsylvanian age.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  The climate is humid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1092 millimeters (37 to 43 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 14 to 17 degrees C (57 to 62 degrees F).  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices is 64 to 80.  Frost free period is 200 to 220 days. Elevation is 190 to 320 meters (623 to 1050 feet) above mean sea level."

Bates, Collinsville, and Dennis soils have more than 50 percent base saturation throughout by the ammonium acetate method.  In addition, Bates soils have a fine-loamy control section. Collinsville soils lack argillic horizons, have a lithic contact within 20 inches, and have a loamy control section.  Dennis soils have a solum more than 60 inches thick."

Depth to the top of a perched water table is at a depth of 30 to 60 centimeters (12 to 24 inches) from November throught April. Potential for surface runoff is medium to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (4 to 14 micrometers per second) in the surface horizon and moderately low (0.4 to 1.4 micrometers per second in the subsoil. Permeability is slow."
