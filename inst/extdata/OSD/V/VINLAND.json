  "OVERVIEW": "The Vinland series consists of shallow over shale, somewhat excessively drained upland soils formed in residuum weathered from interbedded sandy and silty shales. Slopes range from 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 89 centimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
