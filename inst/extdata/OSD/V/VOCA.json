    "content": "REMARKS:\nThe Voca series type location was redescribed and sampled for characterization in 2009.  It was previously described with a paralithic contact within 150 cm (60 in). The series concept was changed to very deep with no bedrock based on a pit at the type location and other observations.  The activity class was changed to active based on NSSL data.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in) (A1 and A2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 23 to 203 cm (9 to 80 in) (Bt1, Bt2, and BCt horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory on pedon number 87TX299001 (samples 87P02410 to 87P02415) from Llano County, TX; Properties and Reconstruction of Pedon 584TX-299-01, Larry T. West, 1984; and Type location in McCulloch County, TX pedon number S09TX307001 (samples 09N02898-09N02903).\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 11th Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
