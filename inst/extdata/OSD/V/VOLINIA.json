  "STATES": "IN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Volinia series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy outwash and the underlying sandy and gravelly outwash on outwash plains. They are deep or very deep to stratified, calcareous sandy and gravelly material. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
