Reaction ranges from extremely to medium acid except for surface layers that have been limed.\nThe Ap or A1 horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8.  The A and E horizons are fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The Bt horizon is typically fine sandy loam or sandy loam; however, some pedons have a thin layer of sandy clay loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.  The 2Eb and 2E'b horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is sand or fine sand.\nThe 2Bhb horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sand or fine sand."

Other less competing series are Autryville, Cainhoy, Centenary, Chislom, and Conetoe.  Autryville soils are Paleudults and lack 2Bhb horizons.  Baymeade soils contain irregular intermittent Bh bodies over Bt horizons.  Baymeade, Chipola, Garcon, Kenansville, and Uchee soils lack underlying Bh horizons.  Also Garcon soils are dominantly gray in the lower Bt horizon.  Blaney soils have slightly cemented, brittle B horizons. Cainhoy and Centenary soils are Spodosols.  Conetoe, Chislom, and Coosaw soils have mixed mineralogy.  Gomery soils have gray mottles in the argillic horizon and do not have buried spodic horizons.  Tenaha soils have more clayey Bt horizons and are underlain with sandstone bedrock at depths of 35 to 60 inches.  Tomahawk soils are somewhat poorly drained or moderately well drained."

The sandy loam Bt horizon is more significant than the darker colored (2Bhb) sandy horizon beneath it.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 21 to 40 inches.\nSpodic horizons - the zones from 60 to 70 inches and from 75 to 90 inches.\nThe lower sequum (40 to 99 inches) is believed to be a buried soil; therefore, the classification of this soil is based on the upper sequum.\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nNC0149 VALHALLA    0-  6   60- 70  210-280  45- 55    10- 100\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nNC0149 NONE          4.0-4.0  APPARENT NOV-MAR  60-60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nNC0149  0-21  LFS LS                  0-  0 100-100  2- 8   1-  3\nNC0149  0-21  FS S                    0-  0  95-100  2- 8   1-  3\nNC0149 21-30  FSL SL SCL              0-  0  95-100 10-20   2-  4\nNC0149 30-99  FS S                    0-  0  95-100  2- 8   0-  2\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
