    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 60 percent in the control section. Gravel content ranges from 5 to 40 percent, cobbles range from 5 to 30 percent, and stones and boulders range from 1 to 30 percent throughout the pedon.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The A and E horizons are the very cobbly or very stony analogues of silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the solum and strongly acid or moderately acid in the substratum.\nThe Bs horizons have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Textures are similar to the A and E horizons. The control section averages from 5 to 15 percent clay.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the solum and strongly acid or moderately acid in the substratum\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 3. The C horizon is very cobbly, very stony, or very gravelly analoguesof fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the solum and strongly acid or moderately acid in the substratum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vanriper soils are on disintegration moraines and bedrock controlled moraines of Wisconsinan Age.  These soils formed in silty or loamy eolian deposits over very cobbly loamy till. Slopes are dominantly 8 to 45 percent, but range from 1 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 34 inches and mean annual temperature is about 40 to 42 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from 95 to 115 days."

Michigamme soils are underlain by bedrock.  Keewaydin and Sundog soils contain fewer rock fragments."
