Bogart, Thackery and Haney soils average more than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Centerburg, Cygnet, Houcktown, Jenera, Nicely, Vanlue and Williamstown soils have more than 10 percent clay and glacial till in the lower part of the series control section. Jugtown soils formed in alluvium with rock fragments of sandstone, chert, and shale. Reaville soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Scattersville soils formed in colluvium from mixed basic and acidic rock materials and typically contain mica flakes. Swampoodle soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from greenstone schist, biotite schist, and basic gneiss and are strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout the soil profile. Tuscola soils do not have rock fragments in the soil profile and formed in stratified loamy and silty lacustrine sediments."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/sec) in the solum and high or very high (42.34 to 141.14 micrometers/sec) in the substratum. Permeability is moderate (0.6 to 2 inches per hour) in the solum and rapid (6 to 20 inches per hour) in the substratum. In drained areas, the depth to the top of the apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 feet from December to April in normal years. These soils are subject to occasional or frequent periods of annual flooding."
