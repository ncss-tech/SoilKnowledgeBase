    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alden, Blakeslee, Cambridge, Chenango, Chippewa, Darien, Frenchtown, Gageville, Manlius, Mill, Nassau, Pierpont, Platea and Red Hook and Wallpack soils on nearby landscapes. The Alden, Chippewa, Manlius, Nassau, and Wallpack soils are typically associated in the extreme southern portions of MLRA 144A. The very poorly drained Alden soils are in upland depressions and lack a fragipan. The moderately well drained Cambridge soils and the poorly drained Frenchtown and Mill soils are in a topo sequence with Venango soils. The well and somewhat excessively drained Chenango soils, moderately well drained Blakeslee soils and somewhat poorly drained Red Hook soils are on nearby outwash terraces. The poorly and very poorly drained Chippewa soils are in upland depressions. The moderately well drained Gageville and somewhat poorly drained Darien soils do not have a fragipan and are on similar nearby till plains. Moderately well drained Pierpont soils and somewhat poorly drained Platea soils are on similar nearby till plains with less sand and more silt. The Manlius and Nassau soils are better drained on nearby uplands and are 20 to 40 in and 10 to 20 in to bedrock, respectively. The well drained Wallpack soils are higher on the landscape and have less than 18 percent clay in the subsoil."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: A large part of this soil is used for cropland. Other uses are pasture, hayland and woodland. Many areas of abandoned cropland are reverting to trees and brush. Crops include wheat, oats, timothy, clover, corn, buckwheat, birdsfoot trefoil, and some alfalfa and soybeans. Native vegetation was deciduous forest with beech, sugar maple, wild cherry, and red maple being the main species."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in) (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - from a depth of 23 to 53 cm (9 to 21 in) (E, Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\n3. Fragipan - from a depth of 53 to 117 cm (21 to 46 in) (Btx1 and Btx2 horizons).\n4. Aquic conditions- beginning at a depth of 23 cm (9 in).\nThe typifying pedon was revisited and described using current terminology during the modernization of the Soil Survey of Ashtabula County, Ohio, published 1973, and its location description was updated.\nIt is anticipated that soils mapped as Venango on slopes greater than 12 percent will be correlated as other series during future MLRA update activities. A future MLRA project has been established in NASIS to investigate and address this.\nFuture MLRA projects have also been established in NASIS to investigate the stoniness phases of Venango, and also to investigate the extent of the Venango series as it occurs outside of its primary area in MLRA 139.\nThe Venango silt loam, sandstone substratum phase mapped in the Soil Survey of Ashtabula County, Ohio, published 1973, was correlated as the Mitiwanga series during the modernization of that survey.\nReferencing the 12th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2014), the Venango series meets criteria for the Alfisol order because it has a fragipan with clay films 1mm or more thick in some part. These thick clay films on prism faces were observed in an archived copy of the Venango OSD dated 6/11/73.  Mention of clay films more than 1mm thick were also observed on prism faces in another archived copy of the Venango OSD dated 11/30/72.  However, a quantitative reevaluation of lab data (AB-S11) does not confirm that the clay increase is sufficient to meet criteria of an argillic horizon in the fragipan.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for the Venango series can be found at the NCSS Soil Characterization Database.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
