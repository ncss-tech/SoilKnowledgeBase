  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Soils in similar families include the Bromer, Fincastle, Hoosierville, and Lieber series. Bromer soils are Aeric Fragic Epiaqualfs and have a paleosol formed in residuum in the lower part of the series control section. Fincastle soils are Aeric Epiaqualfs and formed in loess and till of Wisconsinan age. Hoosierville soils are Typic Epiaqualfs and do not have chroma of 3 or 4 in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Lieber soils are Aeric Epiaqualfs and do not have a glossic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Vigo soils are on broad summits of till plains. Slope gradients are dominantly 0 to 2 percent, but range to 4 percent. The soils formed in loess and in the underlying paleosol in loamy till. The lower part of the loess has a higher sand content and is locally called \"gritty loess\". The till is considered to be of Illinoian age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 12 to 13 degrees C (53 to 56 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 170 to 200 days. Elevation ranges from 107 to 305 meters (350 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

The well drained Hickory soils are on backslopes. The moderately well drained Shakamak soils are on summits and shoulders."

In drained areas, the depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. Permeability is slow."
