  "OVERVIEW": "The Venlo series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are in low, basins and swales on delta, outwash and lake plains and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 20 inches.",

Some pedons have Ab horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or less.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, 5GY, or is neutral, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  Some pedons have chroma of 3.  Those with chroma of 2 or 3 have common or many low chroma redoximorphic depletions.  The Cg horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have Cg horizons with low chroma and distinct or prominent redoximorphic concentrations with chroma of 3 or higher.  The Cg horizon is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sand, or sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Garborg, Hamar, Hangaard, Isan and Isanti series and the Medano series as previously classified.  Garborg soils are somewhat poorly drained and do not have a water table within 1.5 feet of the soils surface during the period of November through July.  Hamar soils are poorly drained.  Hangaard soils are dominantly coarse sand and have 10 to 35 percent rock fragments.  Isan and Isanti soils are acid throughout.  Medano soils are calcareous in the upper part of the control section and noncalcareous in the lower part."

The soils formed in glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine deposits.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 36 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 15 to 24 inches.  Frost-free period ranges from 105 to 140 days.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 650 to 2350 feet."

Garborg soils are on slightly higher positions on the landscape.  Fossum, Arveson and Hamar soils occupy similar or slightly higher positions on the landscape.  Arveson soils are coarse-loamy.  Fossum soils are calcareous throughout.  Hecla, Maddock and Serden soils are on nearby higher lying level to hilly areas.  They are moderately well to excessively drained and do not have an aquic moisture regime.  Stirum soils are calcareous throughout and have a natric horizon."
