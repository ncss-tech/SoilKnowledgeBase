  "OVERVIEW": "The Viterbo series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. These nearly level soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits derived from the Beaumont Formation. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (degrees 69 F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1397 mm (55 in).",
