  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Vaucluse soils have a Bt horizon more than 6 inches thick that is compact, dense, and brittle in 30 to 60 percent of the mass. The brittleness is thought to be due to masses of oxidized iron. This horizon commonly has weak or moderate, medium or coarse subangular blocky structure but in some pedons it appears to be massive. It contains fine roots but medium and coarse roots are not usually present in the brittle part. Since establishment, the series has been classified as: Typic Hapludults, Fragic Paleudults, Typic Fragiudults, Typic Kanhapludults, and (2005) Fragic Kanhapludults.  Further study of the soil is needed to accurately determine the dominant diagnostic characteristics.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 15 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic and kandic horizon--the zone between a depth of 15 and 58 inches (Bt and Btx horizons).\nFragic soil properties--the zone from 29 to 58 inches (Btx horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5   Soil Name     Slope      Airtemp  FrFr/Seas  Precip  Elevation\nSC0008  VAUCLUSE      2-25       57-70    190-245    35-55   100-450\nSC0111  VAUCLUSE      2-25       57-70    190-245    35-55   100-450\nSOI-5   FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nSC0008  NONE          >6.0       -      -       >80     -\nSC0111  NONE          >6.0       -      -       >80     -\nSOI-5   Depth  Texture       3-Inch  No-10   Clay%   -CEC-\nSC0008   0-15  LS S LCOS     0-5     90-100   2-10   1-2\nSC0008   0-15  FSL SL        0-5     90-100  10-20   1-2\nSC0008   0-15  SCL           0-5     90-100  20-28   1-3\nSC0008  15-29  SCL SL        0-5     90-100  18-35   1-3\nSC0008  29-58  SCL SL SC     0-5     92-100  18-45   1-4\nSC0008  58-72  SL SCL LS     0-2     95-100   5-30   1-3\nSC0111   0-15  GR-LS GR-S    2-5     55-80    0-10   1-2\nSC0111   0-15  GR-SL         2-5     55-80   10-20   1-2\nSC0111   0-15  GRV-LS GRV-SL 2-10    35-60    5-15   1-2\nSC0111  15-29  SCL SL        0-5     90-100  18-35   1-3\nSC0111  29-65  SCL SL SC     0-5     92-100  18-45   1-4\nSC0111  65-80  SL SCL SC     0-5     95-100   5-30   1-3\nSOI-5   Depth    -pH-     O.M.
