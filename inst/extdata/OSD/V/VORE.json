  "OVERVIEW": "The Vore series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in silty clay loam\nover sand or loamy sand derived from alluvium. Vore soils are on flood plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 711 millimeters. Mean annual temperature is about\n10 degrees C.",
