Goldstream soils have a thick O horizon and high permafrost tables. Toklat soils are in borders of depressions, and have a cemented spodic horizon."

Investigation to determine the prevailing temperature regime in Volkmar soils is needed for accurate classification. In the spring a water table is held up by seasonal frost.\nADDITIONAL DATA: National Soil Survey Laboratory data S06AK-240-00? from Southeast Fairbanks Borough, Alaska, samples by SSL Lincoln, NE, 07/2006\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
