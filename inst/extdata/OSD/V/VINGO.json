  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.\nDepth to secondary carbonates ranges from 37 to 80 inches.\nThe A horizon is light brown (7.5YR 6/4), brown (7.5YR 5/2, 5/4;\n10YR 5/3), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), light yellowish brown (10YR\n6/4), or yellowish brown (10YR 5/4).  It is loamy fine sand, fine\nsand, or fine sandy loam.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B21t horizon is yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), brown (7.5YR 5/4),\nreddish brown (5YR 5/4), or reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6; 5YR 6/6).\nIt is fine sandy loam.  The clay content ranges from 14 to 18\npercent.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B22t horizon is yellowish red (5YR 5/6, 5/8), strong brown\n(7.5YR 5/6), or reddish yellow (5YR 6/6; 7.5YR 6/6).  It is sandy\nclay loam or fine sandy loam and is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nIt ranges from noncalcareous to calcareous.  A Btca horizon is\npresent at depths greater than 48 inches in some pedons.\nCompeting Series:  These include the Brownfield, Dalhart, Dallam,\nParticia, Pratt, Springer, and Vona series.  Brownfield, Patricia,\nPratt, and Springer soils have mean annual soil temperatures\ngreater than 59 degrees F.  In addition, Brownfield and Patricia\nsoils have Bt horizons with more than 18 percent clay.  Dalhart\nsoils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the B2t horizon and a solum\nthickness ranging from 28 to 45 inches.  Dallam soils have 22 to\n35 percent clay in the B2t horizons.  Pratt soils have banded Bt\nhorizons.  Springer soils are more moist and receive more than 19\ninches of annual precipitation.  Vona soils are of a drier\nenvironment and are dry for longer periods of time."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vingo soils are on undulating or hummocky\nlandscapes.  Ridges are up to 10 feet high with sideslopes ranging\nup to 8 percent.  The soil formed in sandy materials of eolian\norigin although the lower Bt horizon may not be genetic to the\noverlying soil.  The climate is semiarid, and the mean annual\nprecipitation varies from 16 to 19 inches.  Thornthwaite annual\nP-E indices range from 24 to 32.  Mean annual air temperature\nvaries from 50 degrees to 57 degrees F."

Perico\nsoils are calcareous throughout and have more than 18 percent clay\nin the Bt horizons.  Valentine soils lack Bt horizons.\nDrainage and Permeability:  Well drained; very slow surface\nrunoff; moderately rapid permeability in the upper B2t horizon and\nmoderate in the lower part."
