  "STATES": "AZ,CO,NM,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Vessilla series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained, moderately rapid permeable soils that formed in eolian and alluvial material weathered from sandstone. Vessilla soils are on narrow ridges, hills, breaks and mesas of bedrock controlled landscapes. Slopes are 1 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
