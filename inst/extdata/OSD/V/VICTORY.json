  "OVERVIEW": "The Victory series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on summits and side slopes of volcanic hills and mountains.  They formed in material fine-textured residuum from weathered extrusive volcanic bedrock.  Near the type location, the mean annual air temperature is about 80 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is bout 40 inches.  Slopes range from 2 to 70 percent.",
