The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts in the moisture control section for 15 to 30 consecutive days during the summer.  Depth to dense, compacted glacial till is 20 to 40 inches.  The upper part of the particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.60 to 1.0 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of more than 2.0 percent and 15-bar water retention of 12 to 15 percent for air dried samples.  the lower part of the particle-size control section is dense glacial till with an estimated moist bulk density of 1.65 to 1.85 g/cc.  Thickness of the spodic horizon ranges from 9 to 17 inches.\nThe E horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4, 5, or 6 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe Bs1 horizon has a hue of 5YR and 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3, 4 or 5 moist, chroma of 4 or 6 dry and moist.  It is gravelly fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bs2 horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5, 6 or 7 dry, 3, 4 or 5 moist, chroma of 3 to 6 dry and moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly loam, very cobbly sandy loam or very cobbly loam.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe BC & CB horizons have a hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR, value of 5, 6, or 7 dry, 3, 4, or 5 moist, and chroma of 3, to 6 dry and moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, extremely cobbly sandy loam, extremely stony coarse sandy loam, or extremely gravelly sandy loam.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vabus soils are on mountainsides and in valleys and have 0 to 70 percent slopes.  They formed in glacial till with an admixture of volcanic ash.  Elevations are 2,500 to 4,800 feet.  They are in marine influenced climate with relatively cool, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation is 60 to 90 inches.   The mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F and the mean July temperature is about 59 degrees F.  The mean annual air temperature is 39 to 43 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F is 110 to 170 days."
