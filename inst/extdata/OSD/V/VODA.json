  "STATES": "KS",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Voda series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on flood plains.  These soils formed in clayey alluvium over loamy sediments in areas of lake beds formerly covered by water.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 58 centimeters (23 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C. (54 degrees F.) at the type location.",
