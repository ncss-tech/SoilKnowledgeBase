  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the cambic horizon and free carbonates ranges from 11 to 28 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F.  Where irrigated, summer temperatures may range down to 57 degrees F.  The particle size control section is complex with the cambic horizon being coarse-loamy and the majority of the Bk and C horizons being sandy.  When averaged, the control section is sandy.  EC is 2 mmhos or less throughout.  Depth to bedrock exceeds 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is sandy loam with 7 to 14 percent clay.  This horizon is noncalcareous throughout.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loamy sand, gravelly loamy sand, and sand with 2 to 7 percent clay and 0 to 20 percent fine rounded pebbles.  Carbonates range from 2 to 5 percent and are mostly disseminated with very thin powdery coatings on some pebbles.  Reaction is mildly alkaline (pH 7.8) through moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is loamy sand, gravelly loamy sand, or sand with 2 to 7 percent clay.  Carbonates are disseminated and range from 1 to 4 percent.  Reaction is mildly alkaline (pH 7.6) through moderately alkaline."

Slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  Elevation is 6,500 to 7,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 to 10 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 37 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to be about 60 to 90 days depending upon elevation, aspect, and air drainage."
