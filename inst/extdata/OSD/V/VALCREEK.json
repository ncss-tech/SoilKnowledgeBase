  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to weathered granitic rock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Some pedons have 10 to 30 percent of the surface covered with fine gravel.  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from mid July to mid October (about 85 to 95 days).  The soil temperature at 20 inches exceeds 41 degrees F from about mid April to late November (about 210 to 230 days), and exceeds 47 degrees F from early June to late October.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  Rock fragments average 35 to 65 percent in the particle-size control section.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 55 to 100 percent, with each pedon dominantly above 75 percent in the zone from 10 to 30 inches depth.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 6/3, 4/2, 5/3, 3/2, 4/1, 6/2, 5/1, 6/1 or 7/3. Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 2/1, or 3/1.  It is moderately or strongly acid.  The A horizon has 3 to 8 percent clay and 20 to 50 percent fine gravel.  It is less than 7 inches thick in pedons where colors meet Mollic epipedon requirements.\nThe C horizon is a mixture of the following colors; 10YR 8/3, 6/4, 6/3, 6/2, 7/2, 8/2, 7/3, 5/2, 5/1, 8/1 or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 5/4, 5/3, 2/2, 4/2, 3/2, 5/2, 6/4, 3/1, 4/1, 4/4, 6/3, 6/2, 8/1 or 7/3.  It is gravelly loamy coarse sand, very gravelly loamy coarse sand, extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, or extremely gravelly coarse sand.  The C horizon has 25 to 65 percent fine gravel, and 2 to 6 percent clay.  It is moderately to very strongly acid."
