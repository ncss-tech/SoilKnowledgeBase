Shale bedrock is below depths of about 102 centimeters (40 inches).  Gravel content ranges from 35 to 70 percent by volume in the control section.  The upper 13 centimeters (5 inches) of the control section in some pedons may contain less than 15 percent gravel by volume.  Some pedons have an AC horizon.\nA Horizon:\nHue:  10YR or 2.5Y\nValue:  4 to 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist\nChroma:  2 to 4\nSome pedons have a value of 3 moist and chroma of 2 in the upper 10 centimeters (4 inches).\nTexture:  gravelly loam or gravelly clay loam, some pedons can be very gravelly clay loam\nReaction:  neutral or slightly alkaline\nC Horizon:\nHue:  10YR or 2.5Y\nValue:  5 to 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist\nChroma:  2 to 4\nTexture:  very gravelly loam, very gravelly clay loam, very gravelly fine sandy loam or extremely gravelly loam\nReaction:  slightly or moderately alkaline\n2 Cr Horizon:\nThe horizon is made up of shale from the Pierre Shale Formation.  The shale beds increase in thickness with depth.  There are few to many gypsum accumulations between the bedding planes.  It is weakly cemented and slightly or moderately alkaline."
