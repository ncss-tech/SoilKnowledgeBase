The soils are usually moist, but are dry  in all parts in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days during summer and fall.  The upper 7 to 13 inches of the pedon has more than 60 percent volcanic ash in the fine earth fraction.  Depth to paralithic contact ranges from 30 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to slightly acid.  The control section averages 40 to 65 percent sand, 5 to 15 percent clay and 5 to 15 percent mica by weight in the fine earth fraction.\nThe A horizon has a value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  It averages 5 to 10 percent hard quartz pebbles and 5 to 15 percent weathered phyllite and schist fragments.\nThe Bw horizon has a value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It averages 5 to 20 percent hard quartz pebbles and 30 to 50 percent weathered phyllite and schist fragments.  It is loam, gravelly sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, chroma of 2 through 4 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist.  It averages 5 to 25 percent hard quartz pebbles, 0 to 5 percent hard quartz cobbles and 30 to 60 percent weathered phyllite and schist fragments.  It is gravelly loam, sandy loam, or gravelly sandy loam."

Elevations are 2,200 to 4,100 feet.  The soils are in a continental climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters,  The average annual precipitation is 30 to 50 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees is 145 to 170 days."
