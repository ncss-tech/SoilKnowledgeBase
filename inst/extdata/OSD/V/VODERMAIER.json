The 10 to 40 inch control section averages 8 to 15 percent clay and more than 70 percent fine sand or coarser.  It has 20 to 35 percent pebbles by volume and less than 5 percent cobbles.  The soil has a base saturation of 50 to 75 percent in some part above depth of 30 inches.  The soil is medium acid to neutral.  The mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 44 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is 61 to 66 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe C1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe C2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.
