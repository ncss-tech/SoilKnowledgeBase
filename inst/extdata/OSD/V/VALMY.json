They formed in a thin mantle of loess high in volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 1,070 to 1,895 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
