    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F.  The soil temperature is above 41 degrees  for about 210 to 230 days.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent clay in the fine earth fraction  and 40 to 80 percent basalt fragments by volume.  The clay fraction is greater than 50% montmorillonite.  Depth to a lithic contact ranges from 11 to 20 inches.   These soils are dry more than half of the time in the moisture control section when the soil temperature at the lithic contact is above 40 degrees F. Base saturation throughout the profile is assumed to be more than 75 percent.  A thin (1/8 to 1/2 inch thick) 1980 Mount St. Helens ash mantle is on some pedons.\nThe A horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.\nThe BAt horizon is a very cobbly clay loam, very gravelly loam or very cobbly loam.\nThe Bt and Btq horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  They are extremely cobbly clay, very cobbly clay or extremely gravelly clay.  Structure ranges from moderate to strong subangular blocky to prismatic."

In addition, Flatron soils have a mollic epipedon that includes all of the argillic horizon.  Camaspatch, Gwinly, Laufer, and Waterbury soils are usually moist.  Longcreek soils have a soil temperature of more than 41 degrees F for 260 days and are dry for more than 140 days.  Loomer and Lorella soils have an A horizon 1 to 4 inches thick.  In addition, Lorella soils receive 12 to 16 inches of precipitation.  Pioche soils have an A horizon 1/2 to 3 inches thick and receive 12 to 14 inches of precipitation.  Ruckles soils have a C horizon with lime on the undersides of rock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vantage soils are on basalt plateaus, ridgetops, and hillslopes and have slopes of 0 to 45 percent.  They formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt and loess.  Elevations are 1,500 to 3,000 feet.  These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters. The average annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 12 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F; the mean July temperature is about 69 degrees F, and the average annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 130 to 170 days."
