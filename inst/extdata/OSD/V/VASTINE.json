  "OVERVIEW": "The Vastine series consists of very deep, poorly to somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium, and fine-loamy over sandy and gravelly alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and mica schist.  Vastine soils are on low stream terraces and floodplains with slopes 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
