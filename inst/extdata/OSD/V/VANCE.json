  "OVERVIEW": "The Vance series consists of well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from acid crystalline rocks in the Piedmont.  They are moderately deep to saprolite and very deep to bedrock.  The soils are on ridges and side slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 44 inches and mean annual temperature is 61 degrees F. near the type location.",

The soil is moderately acid to very strongly acid in the A horizon, unless limed.  The B and C horizons are strongly or very strongly acid.  Content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to about 35 percent by volume in the A and E horizons and 0 to l0 percent by volume in the B horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam or their gravelly analogues.  Eroded phases are sandy clay loam or clay loam and chroma can range to 8.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam or their gravelly analogues.\nThe BA or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles in shades of red, brown, and yellow are present in most pedons.  Texture is clay loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles in shades of red, brown, and yellow are present in most pedons.  The lower part may contain some low chroma mottles.  Texture is clay, clay loam, or sandy clay with less than 30 percent silt.  Consistence is very firm and plastic.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles in shades of red, brown, and yellow are present in most pedons.  The lower part may contain some low chroma mottles.  Texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam, clay, sandy clay, or loam.\nThe C horizon is multicolored loamy saprolite weathered from felsic crystalline rock.  Texture is variable and but commonly is clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or sandy loam."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Series in the same family are Albertville, Badin, Bengal, Bonwier, Brockroad, Carnasaw, Catharpin, Cullen, Cunningham, Cuthbert, Enders, Endsaw, Fluvanna, Galilee, Gritney, Kirvin, Luverne, Masada, Mattaponi, Mayodan, McQueen, Nason, Remlap, Sweatman, Tatum, Totier, Townley, Urland, Uwharrie, and Williamsville soils.  Albertville, Badin, Carnasaw, Cunningham, Enders, Endsaw, Nason, Sweatman, and Townley soils contain sandstone, shale, or other fine-grained coarse fragments.  In addition, Badin, Bengal, and Townley soils have bedrock within 20 to 40 inches.  Bonwier and Urland soils have less total moisture during the growing season.  Brockroad and Catharpin soils have lithologic discontinuity within the series control section.  Cullen, Tatum, Totier, and Uwharrie soils have hue of 5YR or redder.  Cuthbert, Kirvin, and Williamsville soils contain ironstone coarse fragments.  Fluvanna soils lack mica flakes in the control section.  Galilee, Gritney, Luverne, Masada, Mattaponi, and Mayodan soils lack the very firm consistence.  In addition, Gritney, Luverne, and Mattaponi soils have formed in marine sediments and Masada soils have formed in old alluvium.  McQueen soils contain many mica flakes in the lower Bt horizon and substratum.  Remlap soils have thick sola and clay content in the series control section that ranges from 60 to 75 percent."

All these soils, except Helena, lack the very firm consistence of the Bt horizon.  Appling, Cecil, Pacolet, and Wedowee soils have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Helena soils are in small depressions, head of drainageways, and along intermittent drainageways.  Louisburg, Rion, and Wilkes soils have mixed mineralogy and less than 35 percent clay.
