Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent in subhorizons.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 76 to 80 degrees F.\nThe A horizons have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  They are loam or sandy loam and have weak granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe B horizons have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are loam or very fine sandy loam to sandy loam.\nThe C horizons have hues of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, values of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are stratified loam or very fine sandy loam to coarse sand."

Cornhill and Vives soils have ustic moisture regimes.  Dique soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections.  Limani soils have base saturation of less than 50 percent.  Maraquez, Morado, and Plata soils have regular decrease in organic matter with depth."

Coloso, Maunabo, and Talante soils are somewhat poorly drained or poorly drained and have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control sections.  Mayo soils have base saturation of less than 50 percent and are on terraces or alluvial fans above the flood plain.  Pandura soils are shallow soils on uplands."
