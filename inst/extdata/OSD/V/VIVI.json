Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent in subhorizons.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 76 to 80 degrees F.\nThe A horizons have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  They are loam or sandy loam and have weak granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe B horizons have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are loam or very fine sandy loam to sandy loam.\nThe C horizons have hues of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, values of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are stratified loam or very fine sandy loam to coarse sand."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other known series in the same family.\nThe Cornhill, Dique, Limani, Maraquez, Morado, Plata, and Vives series are similar soils in related families.  Cornhill and Vives soils have ustic moisture regimes.  Dique soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections.  Limani soils have base saturation of less than 50 percent.  Maraquez, Morado, and Plata soils have regular decrease in organic matter with depth."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Vivi soils are nearly level on river flood plains.  Slope gradients are 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in coarse to medium textured stratified sediments from plutonic rocks.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual rainfall ranges from 80 to 90 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 77 to 80 degrees F."

Coloso, Maunabo, and Talante soils are somewhat poorly drained or poorly drained and have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control sections.  Mayo soils have base saturation of less than 50 percent and are on terraces or alluvial fans above the flood plain.  Pandura soils are shallow soils on uplands."
