  "OVERVIEW": "The Visa series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils. The soils formed in sandy, wind-altered eolian deposits of Holocene age. These soils are on very gently sloping to moderately sloping dunes and interdunes. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 406mm (16 in). and the mean annual air temperature is 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

The major tallgrass species are sand bluestem, giant sandreed, little bluestem, and taller dropseed species. The midgrasses are sideoats grama, sand lovegrass, sand paspalum, sand dropseed, blue grama, and perennial threeawns. A large variety of forbs exist but the amount varies greatly from year to year. Woody shrubs consist of sand sagebrush, skunkbush sumac, yucca, and the occasional sand plum thickets. This is a fragile site and is subject to severe wind erosion if not protected by cover. This soil has been correlated to the Sand Hills (R077BY020TX) ecological site in MLRA-77B, 12-17\" PZ."
