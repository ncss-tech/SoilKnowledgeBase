These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.65 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic ash content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples, and 5 to 30 percent pumice paragravel.  The solum is over 80 inches thick and lacks hard rock fragments throughout this thickness.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizons have value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. They are ashy sandy loam, ashy coarse sandy loam, or paragravelly ashy coarse sandy loam."

These soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice mixed with outwash and some till. Elevations range from 2,300 to 5,000 feet. Precipitation is 18 to 25 inches. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The average January temperature ranges from 22 to 26 degrees F, the average July temperature ranges from 62 to 67 degrees F, and the average annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 85 to 120 days."
