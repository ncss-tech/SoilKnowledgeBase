  "OVERVIEW": "The Vyckyl series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from quartz monzonite.  The Vyckyl soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
