  "OVERVIEW": "The Ves series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy, calcareous, friable till. These soils are on convex knolls and side slopes on ground moraines and till plains.  Slope ranges from 3 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 685 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
