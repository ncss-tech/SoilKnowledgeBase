Thunderbird soils are moderately deep and deep with a fine-textured argillic horizon."

Vegetation consists of oakbrush, deerbrush, squawbrush, a few juniper and mountain laurel with an understory of sideoats grama, June grass, blue grama, three-awns, squirreltail, bear grass, snakeweed and annuals. At the lower range in elevation there is less brush and the grasses are dominant."
