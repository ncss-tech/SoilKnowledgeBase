  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Venezia soils are on gently sloping to steep ridges and hills. Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent. These soils are formed on basalt bedrock and closely related materials. They are in a semiarid continental climate with an average annual precipitation of 12 to 18 inches and at an elevation of 4000 to 5500 feet. The mean annual temperature ranges from 52 degrees to 57 degrees F."

Cross soils have fine-textured argillic and Cca horizons. Springerville soils are fine-textured, moderately deep and deep and crack widely and deeply on drying. Thunderbird soils are moderately deep and deep with a fine-textured argillic horizon."

Vegetation consists of oakbrush, deerbrush, squawbrush, a few juniper and mountain laurel with an understory of sideoats grama, June grass, blue grama, three-awns, squirreltail, bear grass, snakeweed and annuals. At the lower range in elevation there is less brush and the grasses are dominant."
