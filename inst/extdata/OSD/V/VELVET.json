    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness ranges from 20 to greater than 60 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 15 to 25 inches.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the solum.  Gravel content ranges from 15 to 35 percent in the solum and cobble and stone content ranges from 10 to 50 percent.  Gravel content in the 2C horizon ranges from 10 to 25 percent, and cobble and stone content ranges from 5 to 30 percent.\nSome pedons have a 2 to 5 inch A horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A and E horizons are gravelly, cobbly, stony, very gravelly, very cobbly, or very stony analogues of loamy sand, sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bs1 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is a gravelly, cobbly, stony, very gravelly, very cobbly, or very stony analogues of loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bs2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 5 or 6.  It has textures similar to that of the Bs1.\nThe E part of the (E/B)x horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The B part of the (E/B)x horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The (E/B)x horizon is gravelly, cobbly, very gravelly, or very cobbly analogues of loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have Ex horizons.  The fragipan horizons are very hard or extremely hard when dry and very firm to extremely firm when moist.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is a gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly, or very cobbly analogues of fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  It is slightly acid or neutral in reaction."
