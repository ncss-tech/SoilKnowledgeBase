    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 60 inches or more.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 15 to 50 percent throughout the B horizon.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown (10YR 5/2), brown (10YR 5/3), dark brown (10YR 4/3, 3/3), or dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam.\nThe E part of the B/E horizon is light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), or gray (10YR 5/1, 6/1) silt loam.  Tongues of the horizon 1 to 10 cm wide extend into the upper 4 to 10 inches of the B horizon.  The A and E horizons range from medium acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe upper 4 to 10 inches of the Bt horizon is brown (10YR 4/3, 5/3), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), dark gray (10YR 4/1), or grayish brown (10YR 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2), silty clay loam with mottles in shades of brown, yellow, or red.  Peds are coated with thick dark gray (10YR 4/1) very dark gray (10YR 3/1), or very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay films.  Prisms are surrounded by tongues and interfingers of silt loam.  At depths of 4 to 10 inches below its upper boundary the B horizon and the BC horizon are yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), brown (10YR 5/3, 4/3), dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4), olive brown (2.5Y 4/4), or light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4, 5/6) silty clay loam or silt loam.  Mottles are in shades of brown and gray.  Some peds have thin discontinuous silt coats.  The Btn and Bcn horizons typically are neutral to moderately alkaline throughout, but reaction ranges to medium acid in some pedons. Carbonate concretions are few or common or many in most pedons.\nThe Cn horizon is in shades of brown in 10YR or 2.5Y hue.  Grayish mottles are present in some pedons.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Carbonate concretions are present in most pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bonn series in the same family and the Brimstone, Deerford, Foley, Grubbs, Hillemann, Lafe, McCrory, and Rosella series. Bonn soils have dominant chromas of 2 or less throughout the B horizon. Brimstone, Deerford, and Foley soils have upper Bt horizons with less than 15 percent exchangeable sodium and Foley soils are dominantly 1 or 2 chroma in the B horizon.  Grubbs soils have more than 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the B horizon.  Hillemann soils have red, acid, silty clay upper B horizons.  Lafe soils have strongly acid through slightly acid A horizons and the calcium-magnesium ratio of the B horizons is less than 1.  McCrory soils have dominantly gray sandy clay loam B horizons.  Rosella soils have more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon."
