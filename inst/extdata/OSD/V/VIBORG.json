  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free calcium carbonate ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon typically is 20 to 28 inches, but ranges from 20 to 36 inches and extends into the Bw horizon.  The series control section is silty clay loam or silt loam averaging between 22 and 35 percent clay.  Depth to firm clay loam glacial till or loamy drift ranges from 30 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is silty clay loam, but some pedons are silt loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  When present the BA horizon has colors and textures of the A horizons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Faint mottles are in the lower Bw horizon of most pedons are are few or common.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk and 2Bk horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  The Bk horizon typically is silty clay loam or silt loam.  The 2Bk horizon is clay loam or loam.  There are common or many, fine and medium accumulations of calcium carbonate in the Bk and 2Bk horizons.  They are mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline. The 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Mottles and stains (oxides) are common in the 2C horizon.  The Bk and 2Bk horizons are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Duroc, Eltree, Graceville, Trent, and Yankton series.  Similar soils are the Alcester, Bon, Bonilla, Chancellor, Davis, Egan, and Wentworth series.  Duroc soils have a drier climate, and formed in sediments weathered from sedimentary rocks.  Eltree and Yankton soils have free carbonate within depths of 20 inches.   Graceville soils have sand and gravel at a depth between 20 and 60 inches.  Trent soils do not have glacial sediments above a depth of 40 inches.  Alcester and Bon soils have an irregular decrease in organic matter with depth.  In addition, Bon soils are fine-loamy. Bonilla and Davis soils are fine-loamy.  Chancellor soils are fine textured and are wetter.  Egan and Wentworth soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Viborg soils are level or gently sloping and are in slight depressions, swales, and heads of drains.  Surfaces are concave or plane and slope gradients typically are less than 3 percent, but range to 6 percent.  These soils formed in silty materials over clay loam glacial till or loamy drift.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 26 inches."

The somewhat poorly drained and poorly drained Chancellor, Whitewood, and Worthing soils are in deeper swales and depressions.  Worthing soils are fine textured."
