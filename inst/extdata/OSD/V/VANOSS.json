  "OVERVIEW": "The Vanoss series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age. These soils occur on treads of stream terraces in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 15 degrees C (60 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 920 mm (36 in).",
