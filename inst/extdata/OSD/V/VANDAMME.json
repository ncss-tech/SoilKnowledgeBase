The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 3 to 6 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 6 to 19 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to August 15 and is dry in some part from September 1 to October 1 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages from 35 to 45 percent clay.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe A horizon is 10YR  6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6, 7/3, 7/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3 4/6.  It is loam or sandy loam with 10 to 27 percent clay.  Organic carbon content ranges from 2 to 5 percent.  Base saturation (sum) ranges from 25 to 45 percent.  Reaction is strongly or medium acid.\nAn E horizon is present at the surface in some pedons.  It is 10YR 7/1, 7/2 or 8/1.  Moist color is 10YR 6/1, 6/2 or 7/2.  It is sandy loam with 10 to 20 percent clay.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 6/8; 7.5YR 5/6, 6/4, 6/6, 6/8, 7/6, 7/8; 5YR 5/6, 6/6.

Bullgulch, Wadecreek and Winchuck soils are very deep and have an umbric epipedon, in addition Winchuck soils have gravelly or very gravelly C horizons.  Hunterscove and Macklyn soils are 20 to 40 inches to paralithic contact.  Loeb soils have an umbric epipedon and have more rock fragments in the control section.  Quinliven soils are very deep."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Vandamme soils occur on broad ridges and upper sideslopes of hills.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 80 to 1000 feet.  The soils formed in material weathered from soft sandstone. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong marine influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 70 inches. Mean January temperature is about 50 degrees F.; mean July temperature is about 55 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 290 to 365 days."

Dehaven and Hotel soils formed from hard sandstone and have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections. Irmulco and Tramway soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections.  Threechop soils occur in similar landscape positions as Vandamme but are farther from the ocean and have an ustic soil moisture regime."
