The moisture control section is moist in some or all parts in March through June.  The average annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value 4 or 5 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a Bw horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam with 10 to 18 percent clay.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have Btk horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is commonly sandy loam or fine sandy loam and less commonly loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  It has 1 to 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a C horizon with properties similar to the Bk horizon.  However, it is neutral or slightly alkaline and has a calciium carbonate equivalent of 0 to 3 percent.  It is loam or sandy clay loam below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons."
