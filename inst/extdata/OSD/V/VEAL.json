A few woody species such as hackberry, cholla, and yucca occur with a light to moderate over story of mesquite.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This series includes soils, formerly included in the Mansker series, that have an A horizon that are either too thin or too light-colored for the current concept of the Mansker series.  Classification changed from fine-loamy to coarse-loamy particle-size control section 5/2007 based on lab data.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in). (A horizon)\nCalcic horizon: 20 to 150 cm (8 to 59 in). (Bk and Bkk horizons)\nCarbonate engulfed horizon: 33 to 203 cm (13 to 80 in). (Bkk horizons)\nCarbonatic mineralogy:  the control section from 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in) has more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent of the materials less than 2 cm in diameter.  High calcium carbonate causes many plants to have iron chlorosis.  Because of the position on the landscape, a percentage of carbonatic coarse fragments are colluvial contributors and functions as a soil with carbonatic soil mineralogy, even though they did not form in situ.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL - S97TX-303-001 (Lubbock Co., TX)  Three partial data by NSSL - 71L465 - 71L466, 71L467 - 71L468, 71L469 - 71L470.\nTaxonomic Version:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
