McGilvery soils are organic and less than 10 inches deep over bedrock. Sitka soils are deeper than 40 inches over bedrock. Partofshikof soils are somewhat poorly drained, are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock and are generally on less steep slopes than Verstovia soils. Sukoi soils are poorly drained and very deep."
