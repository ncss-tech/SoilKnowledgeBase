Depth to bedrock ranges from 14 to 20 inches. Phosphorous retention is greater than 85 percent. Bulk density is less than 0.90 g/cc. Moist 15 bar water content ranges from 30 to 100 percent. Reaction increases with depth, ranging from extremely acid to slightly acid. Coarse fragment content in the control section ranges from 0 to 30 percent with 0 to 15 percent gravel size pumice and 0 to 30 percent cobble.\nAn Oi or Oa horizon is present in some pedons. Combined thickness of the O horizons ranges from 2 to 8 inches.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value from 3 to 5 and chroma from 0 to 3. Texture is commonly silt loam but ranges to include loam or sandy loam.
