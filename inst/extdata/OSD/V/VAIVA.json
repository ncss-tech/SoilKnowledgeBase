  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  these are the Gachado (AZ) and Whipple (CA) series.  Gachado soils do not have common quartzic and felsic minerals in addition to Cr horizons.   Also they are derived from fine grained basic igneous bedrock. Whipple soils are drier in the summer and occur in the Northern Colorado Desert of southeastern California (MLRA 31)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Vaiva soils are on hills and mountains with slopes of 1 to 65 percent.  They formed in slope alluvium from granite and gneiss.  Elevations are 800 to 3500 feet.  The climate is hot, arid continental.  Mean annual precipitation is 2 to 10 inches, of which, about one-half falls during July, August and September.  Mean annual air temperature is 69 to 78 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 240 to 325 days."
