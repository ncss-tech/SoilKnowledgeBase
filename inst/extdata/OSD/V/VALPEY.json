  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Valpey series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over mixed colluvium from basalt, rhyolite and tudd on mountain sideslopes. Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
