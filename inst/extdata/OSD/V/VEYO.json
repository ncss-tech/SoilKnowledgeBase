  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 65 to 75 degrees F. The soils are usually dry during the period the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. They are moist in some parts of the moisture control section for 30 to 40 days during the summer months and are dry for 70 to 85 days during the 120 days following the winter solstice. The soil moisture regime is aridic bordering on ustic.\nDepth to the petrocalcic horizon ranges from 15 to 20 inches. About 30 to 50 percent of the soil surface is covered with gravel and cobbles or stones.  The soil is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is cobbly sandy loam, cobbly loam, or extremely stony sandy loam and contains 35 to 50 percent rock fragments.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 4 through 6. It is dominantly very cobbly clay but ranges to very stony clay loam, or stony sandy clay. The horizon has weak to strong, prismatic or subangular blocky structure. In most pedons a thin Bk horizon occurs just above the indurated carbonate cemented hardpan."
