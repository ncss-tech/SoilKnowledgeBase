  "OVERVIEW": "The Valby series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess mixed with some ash.  Valby soils are on uplands and have slopes of 1 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry throughout between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 80 to 90 days following the summer solstice.  They are moist in some part above a depth of 12 inches for at least half of the time that the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 to 53 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches thick.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 30 inches and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The control section is silt loam with 18 to 24 percent clay, less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand and less than 5 percent coarse fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  It has weak or moderate structure.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is moderately or strongly calcareous and has segregated lime.  Rock fragments range from none to 10 percent."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in loess with an appreciable component of volcanic ash, overlying basalt.  The climate is semiarid with cool moist winters and dry summers.  The mean winter temperature is 31 to 35 degrees F, mean summer temperature is 62 to 66 degrees F, mean annual temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  The average frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."
