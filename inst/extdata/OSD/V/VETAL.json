    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Typically the profile lacks carbonates throughout, but some pedons contain carbonates below depths of 30 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 50 inches and extends into the AC horizon of most pedons.  The control section is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or sandy loam averaging between 12 and 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is fine sandy loam but is very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, loamy very fine sand, and loamy fine sand in some pedons.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is fine sandy loam or sandy loam but ranges from loam to sand.  Fragments of sandstone are in the C horizon in some pedons.  Some pedons have buried horizons below depths of 30 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Surfaces are concave or plane, and slope gradients range from 0 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in local sandy and loamy alluvium on aeolian sediments.  Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 55 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 12 to 20 inches."
