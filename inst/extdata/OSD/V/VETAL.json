  "OVERVIEW": "The Vetal series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sandy and loamy alluvium and eolian sediments in swales of hills, stream terraces and alluvial fans. Permeability is moderately rapid.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 50 inches and extends into the AC horizon of most pedons.  The control section is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or sandy loam averaging between 12 and 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is fine sandy loam but is very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, loamy very fine sand, and loamy fine sand in some pedons.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is fine sandy loam or sandy loam but ranges from loam to sand.  Fragments of sandstone are in the C horizon in some pedons.  Some pedons have buried horizons below depths of 30 inches."
