The soil moisture control section between depths of 8 to 25 inches (20 to 64 cm) is dry in all parts from June 1 to November 1 (120 days).  The particle-size control section (10 to 40 inches, 25 to 102 cm) averages 12 to 18 percent clay and 15 to 25 percent fine sand or coarser material. Reaction is slightly acid or slightly alkaline.  Organic carbon decreases regularly to 50 inches or more and remains higher than .3 percent.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 48 inches in thickness.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/2, 4/3, 5/3 and 4/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.  Surface textural phases mapped are fine sandy loamand loam.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 4/3, 5/2, 5/3 or 6/3.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/3, 4/3 and 4/2.

The soils developed in  alluvium predominantly derived from volcanic rocks.  The climate is Mediterranean with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 23 to 33 inches (580 to 830 mm).  Mean annual temperature is 60 to 62 degrees F (15.5 to 16.7 degrees C).  The frost-free period is 225 to 280 days."

Use of Vina in Butte County is limited only to alluvial fans, not alluvial fans and floodplains that the series concept presently allows. -SS\nUndated remarks: Laboratory data by University of California, Davis.  (Change in classification is coarse-loamy family instead of fine-loamy).  Soils previously mapped as fine-loamy would now be a different series.  The concept of this soil is limited to the fine end of the coarse-loamy family.  The Molinos series if mapped will be the coarser counterpart containing more than 25 percent fine sand or coarser.  The Molinos series is presently inactivated.  The Vina now borders the fine-loamy and coarse-silty families.\nUpdates from SDJR projects not including taxadjuncts that are fine-loamy or Cumulic subgroups that occur on Holocene flood plains. - AEC\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 36 inches (0 to 91 cm) (A1,A2).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
