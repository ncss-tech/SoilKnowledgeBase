Yaxing soils formed in material weathered from sandstone mixed with loess in the upper part. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers, and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 18 inches. The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F. and mean July temperature is about 68 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F The frost-free season is 110 to 150 days."
