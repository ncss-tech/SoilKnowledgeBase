  "OVERVIEW": "The Yeaton series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils. These nearly level soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Beaumont Formation. These soils have been leveled for rice irrigation. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 20.5 degrees C (69 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1397 mm (55 in).",
