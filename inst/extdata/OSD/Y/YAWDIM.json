  "OVERVIEW": "The Yawdim series consists of shallow, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed alluvium or colluvium over residuum or weathered from calcareous siltstone or shale.  These soils are on sedimentary upland hills and ridges and have slopes ranging from 2 to 70 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 14 inches.",
