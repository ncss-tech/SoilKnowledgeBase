Luning soils do not have buried B horizons in the particle-size control section with texture of sandy loam or finer and have subhorizons with more than 35 percent rock fragments. Soda Lake soils are derived primarily from pyroclastic materials and have appreciable amounts of volcanic glass in the particle-size control section. Soolake soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 9 to 12 degrees C."

Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,280 to 1,585 meters. The climate is cool-arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
