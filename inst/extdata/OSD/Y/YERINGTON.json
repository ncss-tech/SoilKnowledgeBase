  "OVERVIEW": "The Yerington series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian sand and alluvium derived from mixed rocks or granitic rocks. Yerington soils are on sand sheets, plains, and fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",

Luning soils do not have buried B horizons in the particle-size control section with texture of sandy loam or finer and have subhorizons with more than 35 percent rock fragments. Soda Lake soils are derived primarily from pyroclastic materials and have appreciable amounts of volcanic glass in the particle-size control section. Soolake soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 9 to 12 degrees C."
