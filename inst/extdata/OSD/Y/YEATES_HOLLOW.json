  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yeates Hollow soils are on gently sloping to steep fan remnants, hills,  and very steep mountain slopes at elevations of 5,000 to 8,400 feet.  Slope gradients are 2 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium,  colluvium and residuum from conglomerate, sandstone and quartzite.  The climate is moist subhumid, with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The average precipitation is 14 to 25 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 36 to 45 degrees F., and mean summer temperature is 59 to 65 degrees F.  Freeze-free period is 60 to 110 days."
