  "BYREV": "Rev. VLM/DLT/MJD",
  "REVDATE": "05/2001",
  "STATES": "ID,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Yeates Hollow series consists of deep, well drained and moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium and residuum from conglomerate, sandstone and quartzite.  These soils are on fan remnants, hills, and mountain slopes and have slopes of 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches.",
