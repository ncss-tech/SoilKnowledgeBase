  "OVERVIEW": "The Yohalem series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from limestone and shale over residuum weathered from shale.  Yohalem soils are on backslopes of hills.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
