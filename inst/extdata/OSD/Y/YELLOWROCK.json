  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are slightly to strongly effervescent below a depth of 1 inch and moderately to very strongly alkaline.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from approximately 59 to 70 degrees F.  Clay averages 5 to 10 percent and rock fragments average 15 to 35 percent in the particle size control section.  Some thin lenses between the depths of 10 and 40 inches contain 35 to 60 percent gravel but average less than 35 percent.  These soils are dry in all parts from May through November. The soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  from March to December and is moist in some part from mid-March to May when the soil temperature is above 47 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 7/1, 7/2, 7/3, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4 or 7/3; 2.5Y 7/2 or 7/3 and moist colors of 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 5/2, 5/3 or 4/3; 2.5Y 6/2, 5/2 or 5/4.  It is gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly loamy sand, very bouldery loamy sand, loamy fine sand, loamy sand or sand. Rock fragments consist of 0 to 50 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 20 percent stone and boulders. E.C.  range from 0 to 16 and ESP ranges from 0 to 30.\nThe C horizon is similar in color and texture to the A horizon. E.C.  ranges from 0 to 16 and ESP ranges from 0 to 100.  Some pedons have 1 to 60 ppm of boron.  Differences between layers indicate frequent deposition.  The organic matter content is very low and does not vary appreciably with depth.  The 10 to 40 inch zone is sand or loamy sand.  The C horizon tends to be stratified with lenses of sand, gravelly sand and loamy sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yellowrock soils are on alluvial fans fan terraces and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed from alluvium of mixed sources and in some aresa granitic sources.  Elevations are 1,200 to 4,500 feet. The climate is arid with very hot, dry summers with infrequent thunder showers of short duration and mild slightly moist winters. The average annual precipitation is 4 to 6 inches.  The mean annual temperature varies from 55 to 65 degrees F.; the mean January temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.; and the mean July temperature is 80 to 90 degrees F.  The frost free season varies from 150 to 300 days."
