  "OVERVIEW": "The Yarts series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from sandstone, quartzite, and shale. Yarts soils are on structural benches, terraces, hills, alluvial flats and fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
