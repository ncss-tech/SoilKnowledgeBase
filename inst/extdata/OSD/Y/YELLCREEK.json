  "OVERVIEW": "The Yellcreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and some till from sedimentary and volcanic rock sources with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  These soils are on backslopes of mountains.  Slopes are 35 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Reaction is slightly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has values of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.
