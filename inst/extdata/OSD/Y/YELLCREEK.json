These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The mollic epipedon thickness is 7 to 15 inches.  The upper 7 to 20 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.00 to 1.20 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section has 50 to 80 percent rock fragments and 5 to 15 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has values of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yellcreek soils are on backslopes of mountains.  Elevations range from 2,300 to 4,700 feet.  Slopes are 35 to 65 percent.   These soils formed in colluvium and some till from sedimentary and volcanic rock sources with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 24 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 22 to 26 degrees F.; the average July temperature ranges from 62 to 67 degrees F.; and the average annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
