  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the dredge spoil soil material ranges from 20 to more than 80 inches.  Shrinkage cracks open at the surface range from 15 to 35 inches apart and are from 2 to 4 inches wide ranging up to 6 or 8 inches in some places, about 30 inches deep, they are commonly filled with fine sand.  Reaction range from very strongly acid to medium acid in the surface layer except where limed and from strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the C horizon.  Shells and shell fragments range from 0 to 20 percent in individual horizons.  The grey color is not indicative of the present drainage but of the condition of the original sediments.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.  The A horizon is fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, and silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5G or 5B, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 8.  The C horizon is sandy clay, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  The 10-to 40-inch control section averages from 35 to 60 percent clay and from 35 to 65 percent silt.  The underlying buried horizon is variable in colors and textures."
