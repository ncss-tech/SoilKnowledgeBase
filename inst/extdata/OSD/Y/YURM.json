These soils formed in alluvium primarily from quartzite and limestone.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 2,400 to 4,200 feet.  The climate is arid with hot summers and mild winters, typic of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is between 3 and 6 inches; mean annual temperature is 63 to 68 degrees F.; and the frost-free season is 200 to 220 days."
