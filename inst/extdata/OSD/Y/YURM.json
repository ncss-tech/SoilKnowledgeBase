  "OVERVIEW": "The Yurm series consists of shallow to a lime-cemented hardpan, well drained soils that are on ballenas and fan piedmonts.  Yurm soils formed in alluvium primarily from quartzite and limestone.   Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
