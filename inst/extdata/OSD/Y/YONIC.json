  "OVERVIEW": "The Yonic series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in eolian material and/or alluvium derived from sandstone, shale, limestone and quartzite.  Yonic soils are on fan remnants or alluvial flats.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
