  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to texture of loamy fine sand or coarser ranges from 61 to 102 cm. These soils typically are calcareous, slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent in all parts of the series control section. However, a few pedons have a noncalcareous, slightly alkaline A or Ap horizon. A calcic horizon occurs below a depth of 41 cm. The upper mantle contains 0 to 10 percent rock fragments and the 2C horizon has 0 to 20 percent. The mollic epipedon is 41 to 61 cm thick. The sand size fraction in the particle-size control section is of mixed lithology.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. It is slightly or moderately alkaline. Some pedons have an AB horizon.\nThe Bk horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, but in some pedons is 3 in the upper part and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Some pedons have a thin 2B horizon with texture of loamy sand, loamy find sand, fine sand, or sand.\nA Bw horizon is present in some pedons having similar characteristics of the Bk horizon.\nThe 2Bkhorizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is coarse sand, sand, fine sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand or their gravelly analogues. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Some have reddish or brownish colored bands. It is coarse sand, sand, fine sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand or their gravelly analogues. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

They formed in 61 to 102 cm of coarse-loamy sediments over sandy sediments, both glacial outwash or lacustrine origin. These sediments are Late Wisconsin in age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 9 degrees C and mean annual precipitation ranges from 610 to 711 mm. Frost-free days range from 130 to 160. Elevation above sea level ranges from 274 m to 488 m."
