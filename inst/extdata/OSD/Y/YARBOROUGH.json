  "OVERVIEW": "The Yarborough series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in sandy and loamy sediments dredged from submerged areas.  These nearly level soils are on flats within and along the margins of spoil pile areas.  These soils are subject to frequent flooding by high storm surge from strong tropical storms.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in), and Mean annual air temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F).",
