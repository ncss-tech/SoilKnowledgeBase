  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ypsilon series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and till derived from granitic rocks, gneiss, and schist.  Ypsilon soils are on glaciated mountain slopes and moraines.  Slopes range from 20 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
