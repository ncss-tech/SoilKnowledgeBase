  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the O horizon ranges from 4 to 10 inches.  Some pedons are covered with a few inches of fresh silty alluvium; others have thin lenses of organic matter in the profile.  Texture in the subsoil range from silt loam to fine sand.  Most pedons are underlain by coarse sand and gravel at depths of 40 inches or more, but in places gravel occurs within 30 inches.  Sandier texture, fewer mottles, and greater depth to calcareous material indicate an intergrade to the Takotna soils."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Kualina series of the same family, the Easley series of the same subgroup, the Tanana and Bradway series of the same great group, and the Takotna series.  The Kuslina soils are not calcareous.  The Easley soils are not stratified and have very shallow permafrost tables.  The Tanana and Bradway soils are micaceous, noncalcareous, and generally have thinner O horizons.  The Takotna soils are generally coarser have fewer mottles, and lack permafrost."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The Charley soils have streaked grayish and brownish colors.  The Rampart soils have brown B horizons.  Both are silty and calcareous."
