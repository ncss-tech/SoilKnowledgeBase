  "OVERVIEW": "The Yacreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or lacustrine deposits over alluvium.  These soils occur on fan remnants and lake beds.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
