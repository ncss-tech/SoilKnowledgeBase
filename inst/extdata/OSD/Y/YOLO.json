  "OVERVIEW": "The Yolo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rocks. Yolo soils are on alluvial fans and flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent, but are typically 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches (505 mm), and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F (16 degrees C).",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean soil temperature ranges from about 60 degrees to 64 degrees F. and the soil temperature is continuously above 47 degrees F. Some or all parts of the 4 to 12-inch section become moist sometime in November and remain moist until sometime in May. The soils remain dry, unless irrigated, the rest of the year. Little or no gravel is present. The 10 to 40inch section averages 20 to 35 percent clay and averages less than 15 percent material coarser than very fine sand.  The A horizon is grayish brown, dark grayish brown and brown in hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and 2, 3, or 4 moist. The upper part of the A horizon ranges from loam or silt loam to silty clay loam and includes sandy loam. It is slightly acid or neutral. Organic matter is approximately 1.5 to 3 percent. The surface is massive or platy and is hard or very hard. The C horizon is pale brown, light yellowish brown, brown, dark grayish brown and grayish brown in 10YR or 2.5Y hue and has value of 4, 5, or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and 3 or 4 moist. It is usually silt loam or silty clay loam and has thin strata of loam, very fine sandy loam and fine sandy loam in some pedons. This horizon is dominantly slightly acid to mildly alkaline but some portions in some pedons include medium acid and moderately alkaline. Free lime is below depth of 40 inches in some pedons. A few thin clay films are present in some pedons. There is no significant weathering of primary minerals into clay size minerals."

The soils formed in  alluvium derived from sedimentary, metamorphic and volcanic rocks. They are at elevations of near sea level to 2400 feet in a dry subhumid, mesothermal climate having a mean annual rainfall of 12 to 40 inches with hot dry summers ant cool moist winters.  The average January temperature is about 45 degrees F., average July temperature is about 75 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees to 63 degrees F. The average freeze-free season is about 220 to 300 days."

Reiff and Sorrento soils have less than 18 percent clay in the 10- to 40-inch section. Zamora soils have an argillic horizon. Arbuckle and Pleasanton soils are on older landscapes and have gravelly argillic horizons. Brentwood soils are fine-textured and have cambic horizons. Capay soils are fine-textured and have intersecting slickensides. Cole soils have thick mollic epipedons and fine argillic horizons. Soboba soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments. Sycamore soils have mottles due to poor drainage within 20 inches of the surface."
