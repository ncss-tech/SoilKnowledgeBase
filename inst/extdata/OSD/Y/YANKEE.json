  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yankee soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping valley fill and fans on basalt capped mesas.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  Elevation ranges from 7,500 to 9,000 feet.  The soils formed in fine textured material weathered from basalt and other volcanic debris with some influence from eolian materials.  The climate is continental with mean annual temperature ranging from 40 to 45 degrees F. and a summer temperature of about 58 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 to 20 inches. Frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
