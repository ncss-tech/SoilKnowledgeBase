  "OVERVIEW": "The Yankee series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that formed in fine textured material weathered from from basalt and other volcanic debris with some influence from eolian sediments.  Slopes are 0 to 9 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 17 inches and average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
