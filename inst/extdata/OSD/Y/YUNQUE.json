The poorly drained Ciales soils are on similar positions, have fine-loamy control sections, and do not have Oxic horizons.  The poorly drained Guayabota soils are on lower sideslope positions and are shallow to bedrock.  The somewhat poorly drained Los Guineos soils occur are on lower sideslope positions and have mixed mineralogy.  The somewhat poorly drained Picacho soils are on upper sideslopes of lower positions and have fine-loamy control sections.  The well drained Utuado soils are on sideslopes of lower positions and have fine-loamy control sections."
