  "OVERVIEW": "The Yunque Series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils on ridgetops and upper sideslopes of strongly dissected uplands.  They formed in a mix of colluvium and residuum that weathered from andesitic to basaltic, marine deposited, volcanic and volcanoclastic sandstone and mudstone.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 185 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 69 degrees F.  Slopes range from 10 to 90 percent.",
