Grovecity soils have 3 to 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section and do not have stratification there. Hoopeston soils do not have free carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).  Plumbrook soils have 5 to 30 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.

These soils formed in  stratified silty, loamy, and fine or very fine sandy lacustrine deposits.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 610 to 889 mm (24 to 35 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.2 to 11.1 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F)."

Darroch, and Kibbie soils are in similar positions as Yahara soils where there is more clay and less silt in the soil. Shiocton soils are in similar positions where there is more silt and less clay in the soil. Salter and and Sisson soils are on slightly higher positions in the landscape and are better drained.  Colwood and Keowns soils are on lower lying poorly drained positions."
