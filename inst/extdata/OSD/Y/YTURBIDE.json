  "OVERVIEW": "The Yturbide series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvial sediments derived from mixed rocks.  Yturbide soils are on alluvial fans along arroyos and in aggraded stream channels in broad valley floors.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

These horizons are typically stratified loamy sand, gravelly loamy sand, sand, or gravelly sand.  The lime content is usually less than 5 percent and the lime is segretared or disseminated."

The fans have complex slopes of 1 to 8 percent.  The aggraded stream channels have a general overall gradient of about 1 percent with convex sideslopes of 1 to 8 percent.  Yturbide soils are at elevations of 2,900 to 6,000 feet.  The soils formed in poorly sorted, gravelly coarse textured alluvial sediments derived from mixed rocks.  These sediments are valley filling materials between hills and mountains.  The mean annual rainfall is about 10 to 12 inches with a summer maximum.  The mean annual air temperature is about 60 to 68 degrees F."
