There is a perched water table above the densic layer from January to April; (oxyaquic).\nThe A and AB horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  This horizon has granular or subangular blocky structure.  It is slightly acid or strongly acid.  It has bulk density moist of 0.80 to 1.00 g/cc.  Acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron is 1.0 to 2.5 percent.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4.
