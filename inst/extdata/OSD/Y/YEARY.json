  "OVERVIEW": "The Yeary series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in reworked marine sediments over dense, very compact glacial till.  These soils are on glaciated uplands and have slopes of 0 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
