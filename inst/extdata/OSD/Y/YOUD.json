  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a duripan ranges from 8 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 64 degrees to 65 degrees F.  The soil between depths of 8 inches and the duripan is dry in all parts from April 1 until December 1 and is usually not moist in some or all parts for as long as 90 consecutive days.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 5Y 7/2, 7/3, 6/2; 2.5Y 7/2, 6/2; 10YR 7/3 or 7/4 and moist color of 5Y 5/2, 5/3; 2.5Y 5/2, 4/2; 10YR 5/3 or 5/4.  It is fine sandy loam or loam and averages 12 to 18 percent clay.  It is moderately acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe duripan has dry color of 5Y 7/3, 7/2, 7/1; 10YR 6/4, 7/2, 7/4 and moist color of 5Y 6/2, 5/2, 5/3; 10YR 4/4, 4/6; 2.5Y 4/4.  Relict redoximorphic masses of iron accumulations are few or common and have moist color of 10YR 5/4, 4/3 or 7.5YR 3/2.\nThe C or B horizon, below the duripan, has dry color of 2.5Y 7/2, 7/4, 6/2, 6/4 or 10YR 7/4 and moist color of 2.5Y 6/2, 5/2, 4/4 or 10YR 5/4. Relict redoximorphic masses of iron accumulations are few or common and have moist color of 10YR 5/6 or 7.5YR 5/6, and are lacking in some pedons. Textures range from sand to silt loam.  In some pedons carbonates are disseminated and/or segregated as filaments or soft masses.  In some pedons there is weak silica cementation in part or all of the layers underlying the duripan. Reaction ranges from neutral to strongly alkaline.  The C or B below the duripan horizon is saline-sodic in some pedons."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Youd soils are on flood plains and terraces at elevations of 220 to 300 feet.  They formed in alluvium weathered dominantly from granitic sources with some influence from sedimentary rock sources.  The climate is arid, and has hot, dry summers and cool, somewhat moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 8 inches.  The mean January temperature is 45 degrees F.  Mean July temperature is 81 degrees F.; and mean annual temperature is 62 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 250 to 275 days."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained, drainage is altered due to the presence of dams and reservoirs in the Sierra Nevada, the filling and leveling of sloughs in the vicinity, and upstream canals and levees; low or medium runoff; moderately slow permeability above the duripan and slow or very slow in the duripan.  The frequency of flooding is rare and the duration of flooding is 2 to 7 days, or is none in areas that are completely protected by upstream diversions of water by dams, canals and levees."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The moderately acid pH on the Ap horizon may be partially due to large applications of sulfur and gypsum over a period of years.  These soils are not dry for 3/4 of the time and do not have indurated laminar plates or caps. Type location symbol for the Youd series, located on the Remnoy Quadrangle in the Kings County Soil Survey, should be closer to the Intersection of Flint and 4th Avenues.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 10 inches (Ap horizon).\nDuripan - layer from 10 to 26 inches (Bqm horizon).\nParticle-size control section - 0 to 10 inches (Ap horizon).\nEntic feature - duripan not indurated in any part (Bqm horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
