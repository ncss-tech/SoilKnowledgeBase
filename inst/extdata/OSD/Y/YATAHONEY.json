    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yatahoney soils occur on nearly level to sloping tableland summits and fan terraces at elevations of 5,200 to 6,150 feet.   Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation is 330 to 410 mm, and the average annual temperature is 5.0 to 7.2 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 70 to 90 days."

Blackleg soils have a Mollic epipedon and more than 35 percent rock fragments in the texture control section.  Boulder Lake soils have deep wide cracks at some time of the year.  Deunah, Lostvalley, Nicholflat, and Thacker soils have an abrupt texture change.   Northcastle soils have a Mollic epipedon and less than 35 percent clay in the textural control section.  Wickahoney soils lack a duripan."
