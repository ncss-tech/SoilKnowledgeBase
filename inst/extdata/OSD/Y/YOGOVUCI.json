  "OVERVIEW": "The Yogovuci series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits derived from sandstone overlying old alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Yogovuci soils are on fan remnants and paleoterraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
