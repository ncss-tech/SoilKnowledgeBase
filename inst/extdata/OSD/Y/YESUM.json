Astrobee soils are formed in nearly level, stabilized parabolic interdunes. Bracken soils have less than 30 percent selenite crystals in the PSCS, are deep to a paralithic contact and are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30). Mamtrack soils have gleyed hues within the PSCS and are found on relict shorelines. Peligro soils are formed in strongly sloping relict playa dunes. Shot soils have hues of 5YR and 7.5YR and have less than 60 percent gypsum in the PSCS. Whitebasin soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact and are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30). Wulie soils have less than 35 percent selenite crystals in the PSCS and have a lacustrine horizon at the bottom of the PSCS."

The soils formed in medium to coarse textured alluvial and eolian gypsiferous deposits.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 11 inches with a summer maximum.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days."
