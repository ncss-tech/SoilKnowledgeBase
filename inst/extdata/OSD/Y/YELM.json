Yelm soils are in a marine climate with cool, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1,067 to 1,219 mm. Mean January temperature is 2 degrees C; mean July temperature is 24 degrees C. Mean annual air temperature is about 9.4 degrees C. The frost-free season is 170 to 240 days."
