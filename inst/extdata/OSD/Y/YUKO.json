Chill soils have 18 to 27 percent clay and 45 to 65 percent sand in the particle-size control section and have paralithic materials of weathered granite.  Corral soils have less than 40 percent silt and average 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Genaw soils have paralithic contacts between 36 and 50 cm.  Ulida soils have mean annual soil temperature of 13 to 15 degrees C. and have paralithic materials of weathered granitic rocks."

Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,375 to 2,135 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
