The soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sediments weathered mainly from diatomite, tuff and basalt, over alluvium derived from ash and mixed sediments, over alluvium derived from mixed sediments.  The climate is characterized by cold moist winters and cool dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches.  The mean January temperature is 27 to 30 degrees F; the mean July temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is 42 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."
