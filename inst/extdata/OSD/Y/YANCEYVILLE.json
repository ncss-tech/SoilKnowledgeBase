Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 35 percent throughout, but individual subhorizons range up to 60 percent. Rock fragments consist of gravel, cobbles, stones and boulders. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid. Flakes of mica range from none to common in all horizons.\nThe A horizon is has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles range from none to common and are in shades of red, brown, and yellow. Texture is dominantly sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons may have thin subhorizons of sandy clay loam.\nThe BC, where present, has colors and textures similar to the Bt, but may include loamy sand.\nThe C horizon is highly weathered saprolite from felsic igneous and metamorphic rock, primarily granite and granite gneiss.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, is weathered felsic igneous and metamorphic rock, primarily granite and granite gneiss.\nThe R horizon, where present, is hard felsic igneous and metamorphic rock, primarily granite and granite gneiss."
