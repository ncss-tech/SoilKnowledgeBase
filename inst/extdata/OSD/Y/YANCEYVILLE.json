  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The solum is underlain by saprolite. Depth to bedrock, both hard and weathered, is more than 5 feet. Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 35 percent throughout, but individual subhorizons range up to 60 percent. Rock fragments consist of gravel, cobbles, stones and boulders. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid. Flakes of mica range from none to common in all horizons.\nThe A horizon is has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles range from none to common and are in shades of red, brown, and yellow. Texture is dominantly sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons may have thin subhorizons of sandy clay loam.\nThe BC, where present, has colors and textures similar to the Bt, but may include loamy sand.\nThe C horizon is highly weathered saprolite from felsic igneous and metamorphic rock, primarily granite and granite gneiss.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, is weathered felsic igneous and metamorphic rock, primarily granite and granite gneiss.\nThe R horizon, where present, is hard felsic igneous and metamorphic rock, primarily granite and granite gneiss."

The April 1997 relocation of the mesic/thermic line in North Carolina and Virginia necessitated the establishment of the Yanceyville series as a mesic counterpart to the Louisburg series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 12 inches (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 12 to 37 inches below the surface (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nMLRA=136(mesic part)\nDatabase Information:\nData Mapunit ID--To be completed\nUser Pedon ID-2015NC033740\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
