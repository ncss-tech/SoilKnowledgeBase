  "STATES": "OK,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Yomont series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy alluvial sediments of Permian age redbeds. These soils are on nearly level flood plains of the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C). Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm (24 in) and Mean annual air temperature is about 16.7 degrees C (62 degrees F).",
