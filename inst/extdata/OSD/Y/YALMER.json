  "OVERVIEW": "The Yalmer series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy outwash over loamy till on ground and end moraines.  Permeability is rapid in the upper part of the subsoil, very slow in the fragipan, and moderate in the underlying material. Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent, but are dominantly less than 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
