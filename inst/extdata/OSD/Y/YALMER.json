    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 36 to greater than 80 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent and volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 4 percent throughout the pedon.  The solum is extremely acid to moderately acid and the substratum is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 5 to 7; and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A and E horizons are dominantly loamy sand, but the range includes sand and fine sand.\nThe Bh or Bhs horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  Ortstein content ranges from 0 to 45 percent.  The Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 4 to 6.  The B horizons are fine sand, sand, or loamy sand.\nThe E part of the 2(E/B)x and 2(B/E)x horizons and the 2E horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loamy sand, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or fine sandy loam. The B part of the 2(E/B)x, 2(B/E)x,  has hue of 10R, 2.5YR, or 5YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.

It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10R, 2.5YR, or 5YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Sand or loamy sand lenses are below 50 inches in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are none.  Closely related soils are the Keweenaw, Menominee, and Munising series.  Keweenaw soils do not have fragipans and have coarser textured substrata.  Menominee soils do not have fragipans and are underlain by calcareous loam till.  Munising soils have dominantly loamy textures in the particle size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent, but are dominantly less than 25 percent.These soils formed in 20 to 40 inches of sandy outwash overlying loamy till.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 27 to 35 inches, and mean annual temperature is estimated to range from 40 to 45 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Yalmer soils are associated with the Tokiahok, Munising, Kalkaska, Assinins, Skanee, and Gay soils.  The well drained Tokiahok soils are on slightly higher landscape positions.  Munising soils are on similar landscape positions but do not have a thick sandy cap. Kalkaska soils are on similar landscape positions where there is more than 60 inches of sand.  The somewhat poorly drained Assinins and Skanee Soils and poorly drained Gay soils are in nearby depressions and drainageways."
