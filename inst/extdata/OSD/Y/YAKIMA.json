    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 56 degrees F. The soils are usually dry. They are dry for one-half to three-fourths of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches in thickness. The upper part of the particle-size control section averages 5 to 10 percent clay and 0 to 35 percent coarse fragments. The lower part of the particle-size control section is sand or loamy sand and averages 50 to 75 percent rock fragments. Depth to the 2C horizon is 20 to 40 inches. Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1, 2, or 3 dry or moist. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, sandy loam,  silt loam or very fine sandy loam with 0 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe 2C horizon is sand, coarse sand or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction and is very gravelly or extremely gravelly.\nSome pedons have a weak B horizon or a C1 horizon."

These soils formed in alluvium derived from loess and basalt and overlie material that is mostly basaltic gravel and sand. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 14 inches. The average January temperature is 33 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 74 degrees F.. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 55 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 195 days."

Esquatzel, Farrell, and Simcoe soils lack strongly contrasting textures in the particle-size control section. Kuhl soils have bedrock at a depth of 10 to 20 inches. Ritzville soils are coarse-silty. Roloff soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Stanfield soils have a duripan at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Umapine soils are very strongly alkaline and calcareous throughout. Logy soils are loamy-skeletal and have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick."
