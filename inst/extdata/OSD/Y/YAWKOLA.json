    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days within the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to sedimentary bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick and includes all or part of the argillic horizon.  The particle-size control section averages 40 to 50 percent clay and 45 to 70 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and  chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 10 to 20 percent clay and contains 25 to 40 percent gravel and 5 to 15 percent cobbles.  It has an estimated 10 to 30 percent volcanic glass and 0.4 to 1.0 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay or clay with 40 to 50 percent clay.  It contains 35 to 50 percent gravel and 10 to 25 percent cobbles.\nThe 3Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or loam with 20 to 27 percent clay. It contains 20 to 30 percent gravel."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yawkola soils are on gently sloping to very steep side slopes of mountains.  The soil formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rock with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  Slopes are 2 to 55 percent.  Elevations are 2600 to 3500 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

Boardflower soils are fine and are on adjacent north-facing side slopes.  Bodell soils are loamy-skeletal, shallow to bedrock, and are on south-facing side slopes of mountains. Fawnspring soils are fine, deep to bedrock and are on adjacent north-facing side slopes.  Jorn soils are fine, moderately deep to bedrock, and are on concave side slopes of mountains.  Littlefawn soils are fine, moderately deep to bedrock, and are on adjacent north-facing side slopes.  Logsprings soils are fine-loamy over clayey, moderately well drained, and are on concave areas of adjacent benches."
