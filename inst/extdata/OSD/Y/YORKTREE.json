  "OVERVIEW": "The Yorktree series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from graywacke, shale, siltstone or sandstone. Yorktree soils are deep to lithic material with spacing between cracks less than 10 centimeters apart. Yorktree soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1065 millimeters (42 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C (57 degrees F).",
