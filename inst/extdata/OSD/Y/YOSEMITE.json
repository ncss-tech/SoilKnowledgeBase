  "STATES": "KY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Yosemite series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils with moderately rapid permeability.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium and are on narrow flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 51 inches.",
