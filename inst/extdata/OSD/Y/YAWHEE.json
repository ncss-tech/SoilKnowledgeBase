The mollic epipedon extend to depths of 10 to 19 inches thick. The ash mantle is 14 to 35 inches thick and it has 60 to 70 percent pumiceous ash and other pyroclastics. It is estimated to have a phosphate retention of 25 to 50 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, 15-bar moisture of less than 10 percent, and moist bulk density of 0.70 to 1.00 grams per cubic centimeter. Hue is 10YR to 5YR moist, and 10YR or 7.5YR dry throughout the profile. The soil is slightly acid or neutral throughout. The gravel, cobbles, and stones are hard lava fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry. Some of the coarse and very coarse sand grains have value of 4 moist and 6 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and 4 dry. This horizon has 10 to 30 percent gravel and 15 to 30 percent cobbles and stones.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist. Coarse and very coarse sand grains have value of 4 moist and 6 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and and 4 dry. This horizon has 15 to 30 percent gravel and 20 to 35 percent cobbles and stones.\nThe 2Ab horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist. It is loam or fine sandy loam and has 15 to 35 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles and stones. It is absent in some pedons.\nThe 2Btb horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and 2 or 3 dry. It is loam or clay loam and has 20 to 30 percent clay, 45 to 55 percent gravel and 5 to 20 percent cobbles and stones."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Yawhee soils are on volcanic cones, escarpments, and backslopes of cuestas at elevations of 5,000 to 6,500 feet. The soils formed in thin mantles of slightly mixed, very cobbly dacitic ash over buried soils of mixed mineralogy. The climate is characterized by cold moist winters and cool dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 25 inches. The mean January temperature is 25 to 27 degrees F; the mean July temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."

Ponina soils have ochric epipedons, clay Bt horizons and have duripans at depths of 12 to 20 inches. Royst soils have very gravelly clay loam and gravelly clay argillic horizons and have bedrock at depths of 25 to 40 inches. Woodcock soils are medial-skeletal."
