The soil between depths of 8 and 24 inches is usually moist in some part from sometime in November or December until May and is dry all the rest of the year. The A1 horizon is pinkish gray, brown or light brownish gray in 7.5YR or 10YR hue; moist value is 4 or more. This horizon is gravelly or cobbly and has 10 to 25 percent rock fragments by volume. It has weak subangular blocky structure or is massive. It is slightly or medium acid. A thin A2 horizon is present in some pedons and lacking in other pedons.\nThe Bt horizon is brown, dark brown, yellowish red, red or reddish brown is 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5 YR hue. If hue is 2.5YR, dry value is more than one unit higher than moist value. This horizon is sandy clay loam or clay loam and has 35 to 65 percent rock fragments by volume. It has angular or subangular blocky structure and is medium acid to moderately alkaline."

Agua Dulce and Keefers soils have, throughout the upper 4 inches, moist value of less than 3.5 and more than 0.7 percent organic carbon. Keefers soils also have 35 percent or more clay in the fine earth fraction of the argillic horizon. Arbuckle, Newville, and Soper soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon. Also, Newville soils have 35 percent or more clay in the argillic horizon and Soper soils have a mollic epipedon. Olivenhain soils have an argillic horizon that has kaolinitic mineralogy, base saturation less than 75 percent in some part, and 35 percent or more clay in the fine earth fraction."

The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with cool moist winters and somewhat foggy dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 20 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.
