  "STATES": "KS,OK,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Yahola series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in calcareous loamy alluvium of Permian and Pleistocene age. These soils are on nearly level flood plains of major streams in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 790 mm (31 in).",
