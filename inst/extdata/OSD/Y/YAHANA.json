  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yahana soils are on broad, flat flood plains adjacent to major drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  Elevations range from 940 to 1400 feet.  They formed in Holocene stream alluvium that historically was subject to a fluctuating water table.  High water tables have been recently eliminated as a result of ground water pumping and upstream dams.  The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 10 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 69 to 75 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 240 to 325 days."
