  "OVERVIEW": "The Yancopin series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in silty alluvium. These soils are on floodplains of major streams in the Western Lowlands of the Lower Mississippi River Valley; MLRA 131. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation is about 51 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 45 to more than 60 inches. The 10 to 40 inch control section contains less than 10 percent sand, 25 to 35 percent clay and 55 to 65 percent silt. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the A, B, and BC horizons and moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3. Redox accumulations and depletions range from none to common in shades of brown or gray. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2. Redox accumulations and depletions are in shades of brown or gray. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe BC or BCg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. Redox accumulations and depletions are in shades of brown or gray. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam or loam.\nSome pedons have C or Cg horizons that have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. Redox accumulations and depletions are in shades of gray or brown. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loamy very fine sand."

These soils formed in Holocene aged alluvium, high in silt. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from about 60 to 65 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation ranges from about 48 to 54 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include: Kobel, Taylorbay, Tipp soils. Kobel soils are on slightly lower positions on the floodplain. They are poorly drained and in a fine particle-size class. Taylorbay soils are on higher positions on the floodplain. They are well drained and have a thick mollic epipedon. Tipp soils are on slightly higher positions on the floodplain. They are moderately well drained and have a thick mollic epipedon."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; Negligible to low runoff and moderately slowly permeable. Most areas of this soil commonly flood a few times each year, for brief to very long periods, usually during winter and early spring. Levees protect some areas. A seasonally high water table is within 1 to 2 feet of the soil surface from December through April, most years."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the surface to a depth of 4 inches (Ap horizon).\nCambic horizon - The zone from 4 to 76 inches which includes the Bg1, Bg2 and BC horizons.\nThese soils were formerly classified Aeric Fluvaqents because they contain more than .2 percent organic carbon at 125 cm below the soil surface. The organic carbon criteria was dropped in the 1998 Keys To Soil Taxonomy. As a result of this change, the classification of Yancopin was changed to Typic Endoaquepts.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization of the type location by the University of Arkansas Soil Characterization Laboratory. Pedon No. S91AR-147-06. Additional data on pedons S92AR-145-01 and S92AR-147-01.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
