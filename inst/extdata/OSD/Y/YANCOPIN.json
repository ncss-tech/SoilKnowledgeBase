  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Yancopin soils occur on level to undulating floodplains of the Cache River, White River, St. Francis River and other major streams in the Western Lowlands and St. Francis Basin of the Lower Mississippi River Valley. These soils formed in Holocene aged alluvium, high in silt. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from about 60 to 65 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation ranges from about 48 to 54 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include: Kobel, Taylorbay, Tipp soils. Kobel soils are on slightly lower positions on the floodplain. They are poorly drained and in a fine particle-size class. Taylorbay soils are on higher positions on the floodplain. They are well drained and have a thick mollic epipedon. Tipp soils are on slightly higher positions on the floodplain. They are moderately well drained and have a thick mollic epipedon."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; Negligible to low runoff and moderately slowly permeable. Most areas of this soil commonly flood a few times each year, for brief to very long periods, usually during winter and early spring. Levees protect some areas. A seasonally high water table is within 1 to 2 feet of the soil surface from December through April, most years."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the surface to a depth of 4 inches (Ap horizon).\nCambic horizon - The zone from 4 to 76 inches which includes the Bg1, Bg2 and BC horizons.\nThese soils were formerly classified Aeric Fluvaqents because they contain more than .2 percent organic carbon at 125 cm below the soil surface. The organic carbon criteria was dropped in the 1998 Keys To Soil Taxonomy. As a result of this change, the classification of Yancopin was changed to Typic Endoaquepts.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization of the type location by the University of Arkansas Soil Characterization Laboratory. Pedon No. S91AR-147-06. Additional data on pedons S92AR-145-01 and S92AR-147-01.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
