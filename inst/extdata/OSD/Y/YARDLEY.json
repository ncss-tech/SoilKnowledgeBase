Harkers soils have gravelly or cobbly B2t horizons, and they have montmorillonitic mineralogy Manila soils have a solum that is over 50 inches thick and have montmorillonitic mineralogy. Maple Mountain soils have less than 35 percent clay in the B2t horizons and have 20 to 40 percent cobbles. Rob Roy soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy and are 20 to 40 inches deep over bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING: Yardley soils are on gently sloping to sloping alluvial fans and mountain valleys, and steep mountain slopes with gradients commonly of 1 to 6 percent, but ranging from 1 to 30 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,700 to 7,700 feet. The soils formed in deep alluvial soil material from acid and intermediate igneous rocks. The climate is moist subhumid. Mean annual temperature is 39 to 40 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 60 to 62 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 18 to 20 inches. The frost-free period is 65 to 85 days."
