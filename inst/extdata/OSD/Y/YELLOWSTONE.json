  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist but is dry for a short period of less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 to 12 inches in the four month period following the summer solstice in most years. The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is less than 47 degrees F. with an O horizon present. The particle-size control section has moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cubic centimeter. It has greater than 85 percent phosphate retention, 2.0 to 4.0 percent acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, 2.0 to 15 cmol/kg of KCL-extractable aluminum, and 15 to 30 percent 15-bar moisture (air dried). It is weakly or moderately smeary. Depth to a lithic contact is 10 to 20 inches. The soils have 10 to 20 percent clay content by field estimate, and 40 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. The umbric epipedon extends to the bedrock in some pedons. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid. Hue is 10YR to 5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Fine-earth texture is medial loam or medial sandy loam with 10 to 20 percent clay content by field estimate. It has 10 to 25 percent gravel, 5 to 20 percent cobbles and 10 to 25 percent stones.\nThe AC and C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. Fine-earth texture is medial sandy loam, or medial loam with 10 to 20 percent clay content by field estimate. It has 10 to 30 percent gravel, 25 to 50 percent cobbles, and 15 to 50 percent stones.\nThe Bw horizon, when present, has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. Fine-earth texture is medial loam or medial sandy loam with 10 to 20 percent clay content by field estimate and 35 to 70 percent rock fragments."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Buckman, Bungalow, Constance, Graves, and Weatherwax series. Buckman and Bungalow soils are very shallow to bedrock and have less than 2 cmol/kg of aluminum. Constance soils have an ochric epipedon and less than 2 cmol/kg of aluminum. Graves soils are very shallow to bedrock and have high amounts of organic matter and qualify for Fulvi greatgroup. Weatherwax soils are perudic, very shallow to bedrock, and qualify for Fulvi greatgroup."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Yellowstone soils occur on summits and shoulder slopes of mountains. Elevations are 2,000 to 5,000 feet. Where these soils are mapped in the Oregon Coast Range elevations are 2,000 to 4,100 feet. Where these soils are mapped in the Oregon Cascade Range elevations are 2,600 to 5,000 feet. Slopes are 3 to 90 percent. The soils formed in loamy colluvium and residuum derived from basalt and other igneous and volcanic rock types. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 200 inches. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. The average January air temperature is 31 degrees F. and the average July air temperature is 57 degrees F. The frost-free period is 30 to 100 days."

Crabtree and Winberry soils have an ochric epipedon and are more than 20 inches to bedrock. Cruiser and Keel soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments and are more than 20 inches to bedrock. Henline and Lurnick soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. Lurnick and Luckiamute soils are derived from sandstone and siltstone parent materials and have andic properties but do not meet the thickness requirements for Andisols. Maryspeak soils are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock and are sandy-skeletal. Mulkey soils have an umbric epipedon greater than 20 inches thick, have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, and are greater than 20 inches to bedrock."
