  "OVERVIEW": "The Yata series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rocks.  Yata soils are on cuestas and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 50 to 80 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 3.9 degrees C., and the mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm.",
