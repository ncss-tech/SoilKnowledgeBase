    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture: Usually wet in winter and early spring for about 3 months, dry the remainder of the year; aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.\nMean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.\nDepth to base of cambic horizon and upper boundary of horizons with pararock fragments: 33 to 66 cm.\nDepth to root-limiting layer: 50 to 90 cm to a paralithic contact.  The paralithic materials below the contact are weakly cemented silty lacustrine deposits that are assumed to be high in diatoms and volcanic glass.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 18 to 27 percent.\nFine sand or coarser content: 15 to 35 percent.\nVolcanic glass content: 30 to 90 percent in coarse silt through very coarse sand fractions.\nA horizon\nValue: 5 or 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nBw horizons\nValue: 6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.\nChroma: 1 or 2 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nTexture: Ashy silt loam, ashy silty clay loam, or ashy loam.\nReaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nEffervescence: Slightly effervescent to violently effervescent.\n2C horizon\nTexture: Very paragravelly ashy silt loam or extremely paragravelly ashy silt loam.\nPararock fragments: 35 to 80 percent paragravel.\nReaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nOther features: Pararock fragments consist of weakly cemented silty lacustrine deposits that are fractured.  The majority of these fragments are water-stable and will not slake after air-drying and soaking in water for at least one hour."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Youtlkue soils are on depressions on lakebeds.  These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived mainly from volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,345 meters.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Abert, Horning, Morehouse, and Tonor soils.  Abert and Tonor soils are ashy, very deep, have cambic horizons, and are on summit positions of lake terraces.  Horning and Morehouse soils are ashy, very deep, have ashy sandy textures in the particle-size control section, and occur on stable dunes."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; medium surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Episaturation is present with perched free water between the soil surface and the paralithic contact (very shallow free water occurrence class) between February and April in most years.  Cumulative annual duration class is Transitory.  Some small areas of these soils are susceptible to rare ponding for brief duration in wet years from January through March with water a few cm deep.  Most areas of these soils do not pond water in normal years."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A horizon and part of the Bw1 horizon).\nCambic horizon - The zone from 13 to 56 cm (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\nVitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 76 cm (A, Bw1, and Bw2 horizons and part of the 2C horizon).\nEpisaturation feature - The condition of perched ground water with an upper boundary between the soil surface and the underlying bedrock at certain times during normal years (parts of the A, Bw1, Bw2, and 2C horizons).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 81 cm to underlying weakly cemented lacustrine deposits (2Cr layer).\nParticle-size control section and ashy substitute class with glassy mineralogy - The zone from 25 to 89 cm (Bw2 and 2C horizons and part of the Bw1 horizon).\nThe revision of August 2004 updated the taxonomic class from Ashy, glassy, frigid Vitrixerandic Haplocambids and recognized the presence of episaturation.  A prior revision in April 2001 updated the taxonomic class from Fine-silty, mixed, frigid Xeric Haplocambids.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The Bw2 horizon of the typical pedon at the series type location was reference sampled for the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S94OR-037-005 (pedon # 95P0061).  Selected data for particle-size, chemical properties, and optical mineralogy are available for this horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
