  "OVERVIEW": "The Youtlkue series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic ash.  Youtlkue soils are on depressions on lakebeds.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

Episaturation is present with perched free water between the soil surface and the paralithic contact (very shallow free water occurrence class) between February and April in most years.  Cumulative annual duration class is Transitory.  Some small areas of these soils are susceptible to rare ponding for brief duration in wet years from January through March with water a few cm deep.  Most areas of these soils do not pond water in normal years."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A horizon and part of the Bw1 horizon).\nCambic horizon - The zone from 13 to 56 cm (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\nVitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 76 cm (A, Bw1, and Bw2 horizons and part of the 2C horizon).\nEpisaturation feature - The condition of perched ground water with an upper boundary between the soil surface and the underlying bedrock at certain times during normal years (parts of the A, Bw1, Bw2, and 2C horizons).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 81 cm to underlying weakly cemented lacustrine deposits (2Cr layer).\nParticle-size control section and ashy substitute class with glassy mineralogy - The zone from 25 to 89 cm (Bw2 and 2C horizons and part of the Bw1 horizon).\nThe revision of August 2004 updated the taxonomic class from Ashy, glassy, frigid Vitrixerandic Haplocambids and recognized the presence of episaturation.  A prior revision in April 2001 updated the taxonomic class from Fine-silty, mixed, frigid Xeric Haplocambids.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The Bw2 horizon of the typical pedon at the series type location was reference sampled for the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S94OR-037-005 (pedon # 95P0061).  Selected data for particle-size, chemical properties, and optical mineralogy are available for this horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
