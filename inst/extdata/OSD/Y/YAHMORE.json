  "OVERVIEW": "The Yahmore series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, shale, and basalt on toeslopes and footslopes. Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
