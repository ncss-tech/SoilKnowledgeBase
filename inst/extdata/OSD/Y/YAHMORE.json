Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 7,400 to 8,600 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches with more than 50 percent falling as snow from winter storms. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

Kunz and Tunitcha soils are fine-loamy, lack mollic epipedons and occur on adjacent knolls, footslopes and backslopes.  Sandark soils are sandy and occur in more heavily wooded areas.  Tuntsa soils lack argillic horizons and occur on adjacent non-wooded areas."
