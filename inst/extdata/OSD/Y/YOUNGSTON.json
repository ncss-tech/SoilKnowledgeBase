  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are typically calcareous throughout but are leached a few inches in some pedons.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 4 to 15 percent throughout the control section.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 47 to 52 degrees F.  The stratified particle size control section averages loam or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 but less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  The strata are quite variable; but very fine sandy loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, and sandy clay loam are most common.  Most pedons are free of rock fragments, but fine or very fine angular or rounded pebbles range from 0 to 15 percent.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  EC ranges from 0 to 4 on the dry sites and 2 to 16 on the flooded and wet sites.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline on dry sites and range to strongly alkaline on flooded and wet areas.\nThe AC horizon, when present, has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  EC ranges from 2 to 16 mmhos with the higher EC's on the wet or flooded sites.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  EC ranges from 2 to 16 mmhos, with the higher EC on the wet and flooded sites."

Battlerock soils have average annual soil temperature of 55 to 57 degrees F. The Binton and Boysen soils have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium throughout.  Clayhole soils have horizons of gypsum accumulation. The Jocity soils have hue of 5YR or redder.  Lostwells soils have more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the particle size control section.  The Toddler soils have from 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent throughout the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Youngston soils are on alluvial fans, fan aprons, and alluvial terraces.  These soils formed in stratified, calcareous alluvium from mixed sources.  When irrigated, water tables are common due to ditch and tailwater seepage.  The water is oxygenated and low chroma mottles are uncommon.  Flooding occurs on low, poorly entrenched bottoms and along major streams.  Slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  Elevations are 3,600 to 6,300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and ranges from 5 to 10 inches of which about half falls as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 44 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 110 to 140 days depending upon elevation, aspect, or air drainage."

Apron soils have a regular decrease in organic carbon and have less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Effington and Stutzman soils have over 35 percent clay and have a regular decrease in organic carbon.  Effington soils also have over 15 percent exchangeable sodium.  Persayo soils have bedrock at 20 inches or less."
