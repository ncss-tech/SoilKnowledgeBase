  "OVERVIEW": "The Yankton series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in silty sediments underlain by glacial till on uplands. Permeability is moderate in the solum and slow or moderately slow in the underlying material. Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum typically is 30 to 40 inches but ranges from 25 to 45 inches. Depth to glacial till typically is 30 to 36 inches but ranges from 25 to 40 inches. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches, and it extends into the B horizon in most pedons. Depth to carbonates ranges from 10 to 20 inches. The control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay.\nThe Ap and A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3. It ranges from slightly acid in the upper part to slightly alkaline in the lower part. In most pedons, the upper A horizon averages 15 to 18 percent clay and the lower part contains more than 18 percent clay and has a stronger grade of structure.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe BCk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It has few to many, fine or medium accumulations of carbonates. Some pedons lack carbonates in the BC horizon. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. A 2BC horizon is in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. It typically is clay loam but is loam in some pedons. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Accumulations of carbonates range from few to many. Some pedons have mottles."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Duroc, Eltree, Graceville, Trent, and Viborg soils in the same family and the Eakin and Egan series. The Duroc, Eltree, and Graceville soils do not have glacial till between depths of 20 and 40 inches. In addition, Duroc soils receive less rainfall, and Graceville soils typically contain more clay and are leached of carbonates to greater depths. Trent and Viborg soils contain more clay and are leached of carbonates to greater depths. In addition, Viborg soils have mottles above 40 inches. The Eakin soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick and have an argillic horizon. Egan soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Yankton soils are nearly level to moderately sloping on uplands. Surfaces are plane or convex, and slope gradients range from 0 to 9 percent but typically are less than 6 percent. Yankton soils formed in calcareous silty sediments underlain by loamy glacial till. The thickness of these silty sediments ranges from about 2 to 3.5 feet. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 24 inches."

Eltree soils typically are on gentle slopes below the Yankton soils. Alcester soils are leached of carbonates to greater depths and are in swales. Clarno and Ethan soils are fine-loamy and are on crests of knolls and ridges. Roxbury soils are stratified and on the flood plains."
