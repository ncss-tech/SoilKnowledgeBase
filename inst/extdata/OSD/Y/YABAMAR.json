  "OVERVIEW": "The Yabamar series consists of shallow to weathered bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from calc-silicate hornfels and similar calcium rich metamorphic rocks.  Yabamar soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 60 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
