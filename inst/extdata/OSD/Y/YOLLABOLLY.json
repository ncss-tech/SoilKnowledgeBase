  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a lithic contact is 10 to 20 inches.  Changes in depth occur erratically over a span of less than 2 feet.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 44 degrees to 47 degrees F.  Soil just above the bedrock is usually moist all the time from October until June or mid-July and is usually dry all the rest of the year.  Angular and subangular rock fragments of various sizes and amounts form a surface layer.  On the average, rock fragments make up 35 to 75 percent of the soil profile.  The soils are sandy loam or loam throughout.\nThe A horizon is 10YR or 2.5 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/4, 7/4, or 7/2 or 7.5YR 6/4..  Reaction is moderately to very strongly acid.\nThe C horizon is similar to the A horizon and differs mostly by being lighter color in all pedons.  It is 10YR or 2.5Y 5/6, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6, 7/3, 7/4.  Moist colors in the A horizon and C horizon are 1 or 2 units darker.  Except for mica or silt coats, horizon features such as clay films are lacking.  Soil structure is lacking in most pedons or is weak where present.  The C horizon is strongly or very strongly acid.  No pedons are very strongly acid throughout."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in the same family.  Similar series are the Goulding, Maymen, Sheetiron, Waca, and Weitchpec in other families.  Goulding and Maymen soils have a mean annual soil temperature above 47 degrees F. Sheetiron and Waca soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Waca soils also have umbric epipedons.  Weitchpec soils have magnesic mineralogy."

They formed in  material weathered from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks.  The climate is subhumid with cold wet winters and cool dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 40 to 70 inches, with a cover of snow from about November to March.  The average annual temperature is about 43 to 48 degrees F, the average July temperature is about 62 degrees F, the average January temperature is about 30 degrees F. The frost-free season is about 80 to 130 days."

    "content": "REMARKS: As formerly mapped the series contained pedons thought to have cambic horizons.  The horizon was usually absent and recognition questionable.  As now defined, the series excludes soils with cambic horizons. Tyson series in the Mendocino National Forest Interim Report is a taxadjunct.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: Ochric epipedon - 0 to 4 inches.\nLithic contact - 0 to 10 inches.\nParticle-size control section - the entire soil.\nAcid class: pH(1:1 water) is 5.5 or less.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
