  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Yarbam soils are on pediments, hill and mountain side slopes and shoulders at elevations of 4,000 to 6,800 feet.  Slopes range from 6 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in slope alluvium, colluvium and residuum from calcareous sedimentary rocks that include limestone, marble and calcareous sandstone.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 23 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December to February.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 210 days."
