The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nADDITIONAL DATA: See S90NM-13-1 for characterization data, NSSL, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
