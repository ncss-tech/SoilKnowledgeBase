  "OVERVIEW": "The Yucca series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sandy sediments of eolian or alluvial origin derived dominantly from mixed sources.  Yucca soils are on basin floors and fan piedmonts with slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
