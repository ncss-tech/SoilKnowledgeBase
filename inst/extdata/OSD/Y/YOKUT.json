It is not below 41 degrees F\nat any time.  The soil between 10 and 30 inches is moist in all\nparts from January 1 to May 1 and dry in all parts from July 1 to October 31.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent in the A horizon, from 20 to 30 percent in the 2BA horizon, and from 60 to\n80 percent in the 2Bt horizon.  Some pedons do not have a 2BA horizon.  Organic matter is less than 1 percent in the A horizon.\nThe A and Ap horizons are 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 5/6; 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/4, 6/3 or 6/4.  Moist colors are 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4; 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4,\n4/3 or 4/4.  Some pedons are hard and massive when dry.  Reaction\nis medium acid to neutral.  It is sandy loam or loam in the upper part and loam or sandy clay loam in the lower part.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were mapped as Mocho and Pleasonton in the\nLos Banos Area, Series 1939 report.  They are being differentiated\nby having an argillic horizon, which is not typical of the Mocho series and by having less than 0.7 percent organic carbon in the upper 4 inches of the surface horizon which is not typical of the Pleasonton series.  pH determined by colormetric method using\nThymol Blue and Hellige-Truog Triplex indicators.  Texture\ndetermined by hydrometer method.  Organic matter estimated from adjacent soils where Walkley-Black digestion method was used.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 8 inches.\nArgillic horizon - 21 to 68 inches(2Bt1, 2Bt2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
