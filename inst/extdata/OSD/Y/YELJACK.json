  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 32 inches thick. The depth to the upper boundary of the B2t horizon is 24 to 39 inches. The combined thickness of the Al, Bl and B2t horizons ranges from 45 to more than 60 inches thick. Some pedons are underlain by sandstone or conglomerate at depths of 55 to more than 60 inches. The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 41 to 43 degrees F. The mean summer temperature ranges from 54 to 59 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days during the late summer. Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent in the Al horizon, 0 to 15 percent in the Bl horizon, and 0 to 20 percent in the B2t horizon.\nThe Al horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist. It is medium acid to neutral and is 20 to 32 inches thick.\nThe Bl horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR; value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 6 moist. It is loam or very fine sandy loam. This horizon is slightly acid or neutral .\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist. It ranges from clay loam, silty clay loam or sandy clay loam to cobbly clay loam in the lower portion. Structure ranges from weak medium prismatic or weak to strong, fine through coarse subangular blocky. Clay films are few through many thin through moderately thick. This horizon is noncalcareous to moderately calcareous, medium acid through neutral and is 10 to 30 inches or more thick.\nIn some pedons a C horizon occurs at depths of 45 to more than 60 inches below the mineral soil surface. It has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 8 dry and moist.\nThe C horizon where present ranges from loam or light clay loam. It is noncalcareous to strongly calcareous and slightly acid to moderately alkaline."
