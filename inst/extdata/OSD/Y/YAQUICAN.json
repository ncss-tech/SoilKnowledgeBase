Faraway soils are neutral to moderately acid. Oro Grande soils are neutral to moderately alkaline. Seralin soils are derived from limestone and are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30) and receive most of their precipitation in the winter. Rotagilla soils receive less than 16 inches of precipitation."

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from dacitic tuff.  The mean annual precipitation is 23 to 25 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December to February.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 56 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 180 days."
