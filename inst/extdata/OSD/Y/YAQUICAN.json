  "OVERVIEW": "The Yaquican series consists of shallow and very shallow to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from dacite tuff.  Yaquican soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 55 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

Faraway soils are neutral to moderately acid. Oro Grande soils are neutral to moderately alkaline. Seralin soils are derived from limestone and are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30) and receive most of their precipitation in the winter. Rotagilla soils receive less than 16 inches of precipitation."

The mean annual precipitation is 23 to 25 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December to February.
