    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to the soft limestone ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction is moderately alkaline throughout.  Amount of fine limestone fragments in the solum ranges from few to common, but never exceeds 15 percent by volume.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 3 or less.  Texture is loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4; or there is no dominant color and is multicolored in shades of yellow and brown.  Texture is dominantly silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 6 to 8, and value of 1 to 4.  Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam; or their channery or cobbly analogues. Percent by volume of soft chalk fragments ranges from 5 to 15 percent. Content of nodules, concretions, and/or soft masses of calcium carbonate ranges from common to many.\nThe Cr horizon is level-bedded chalk or soft limestone with platy rock structure. It can be easily excavated with hand tools, and is rippable by mechanized equipment."
