  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. GRB",
  "REVDATE": "09/2002",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Yauco series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on rounded hills and foot slopes of uplands.  They formed in calcareous sediments overlying soft limestone bedrock.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F., and the mean annual rainfall is about 25 inches.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.",

Amount of fine limestone fragments in the solum ranges from few to common, but never exceeds 15 percent by volume.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 3 or less.  Texture is loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4; or there is no dominant color and is multicolored in shades of yellow and brown.  Texture is dominantly silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 6 to 8, and value of 1 to 4.  Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam; or their channery or cobbly analogues. Percent by volume of soft chalk fragments ranges from 5 to 15 percent. Content of nodules, concretions, and/or soft masses of calcium carbonate ranges from common to many.\nThe Cr horizon is level-bedded chalk or soft limestone with platy rock structure. It can be easily excavated with hand tools, and is rippable by mechanized equipment."
