    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to carbonates range from 20 to 40 inches within the soil, or the underlying bedrock is effervescent. Rock fragments range from 5 to 20 percent in the solum, and from 15 to 35 percent in the substratum if present. There are few to many redoximorphic accumulations in all of or in parts of the Bt horizon.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR. Values of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture ranges from silt loam to silty clay loam. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is slit loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizons have hues of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, values of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture ranges from silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C or 2C horizon, where present, has hues of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, values of 3 through 6 and and chroma of 3 or 4. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

The Wassaic soils do not have redoximorphic accumulations within the Bt.\nCanandaigua, Lakemont, and Fonda soils are in related families. These soils all have aquic conditions within 50 cm of the soil surface."

It is pronounced you.nen.yeti (you as in the person spoken to, nen rhyming with men, and yeti rhyming with the last two syllables of confetti).\nActual Lat/Long of profile not printed on the OSD by agreement with the Tuscarora Nation.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1) Glossic subgroup-meets the requirements for the glossic 5 percent of Bt/E horizon.\n2) Argillic Horizon---the zone from 12 to 22 inches.\n3) Endoaqualfs great group---redoximorphic features in all layers between 25 and 40 cm, and 50 percent redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less on the faces of peds and redox concentrations in the top 12.5 cm of the argillic horizon. Endosaturation, and does not meet any of the stipulative criteria of any of the other great groups of Aqualfs.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
