  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Ysidora soils resemble those of the Arlington, Arbuckle, Buren, Hillgate, Jalama, Perkins, and Redding series.  The Arlington soils have sandy loam argillic horizons and duripans with less than 15 percent coarse fragments, and are developed in alluvium predominantly from granitic rocks.  The Arbuckle soils lack duripans immediately below the argillic horizon.  The Buren soils have argillic horizons and duripans with less than 15 percent coarse fragments, and are developed in alluvium predominantly from basic igneous rocks.  The Hillgate soils have argillic horizons with less than 15 percent coarse fragments, and lack duripans immediately below the argillic horizon.  The Jalama soils have dark gray to dark grayish brown, medium to strongly acid argillic horizons.  The Perkins soils have fine textured argillic horizons, and lack duripans immediately below the argillic horizon.  The Redding soils are medium to strongly acid, and have strongly indurated very gravelly duripans."

The climate is one of long, dry summers and mild, moist winters, with an average annual rainfall of 10 to 15 inches.  The average January temperature is 52 degrees F., the average July temperature 75 degrees F., and the average annual temperature 63 degrees F."

The Cortina soils are developed in moderately coarse, very gravelly recent alluvium, and lack diagnostic subsurface horizons.  The Lodo soils are underlain by hard metamorphic rock at less than 20 inches."
