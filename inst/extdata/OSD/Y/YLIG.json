  "OVERVIEW": "The Ylig series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils with moderately slow permeability. They are in seep areas on concave hillsides and in drainageways, and formed in alluvium derived from weathered tuff and tuff breccia. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 90 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F.",
