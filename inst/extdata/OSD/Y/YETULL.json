  "REVDATE": "06/2003",
  "STATES": "MT,ND,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Yetull series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium or eolian deposits or glacial lakeshore sediments.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, dunes, till plains, hills and escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
