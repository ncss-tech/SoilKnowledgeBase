    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 69 to 72 degrees F.\nThe 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section averages fine sand, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or sand.  Electrical conductivity of the saturation extract is 0 to 8 millimhos/cm in the control section.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 3 to 15 percent throughout.\nThe A and C horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  Reaction is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.   Exchangeable sodium generally increases with depth and is estimated to range from 15 to 30 percent in the upper 12 inches and from 20 to 50 percent from 12 to 60 inches."

Als and Razito soils have less than 15 percent exchangeable sodium.  Ecklund soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock. Hawsley and Isolde soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 53 to 59 degrees F., and in addition, Isolde soils are noncalcareous throughout. Kewake soils have an exchangeable sodium percentage less than 15 percent in the A horizon and upper part of the C horizon and, in addition, have 5 to 30 percent sand sized pumice.  Hawsley, Stumble and Tipperary soils have Bk or Ck horizons.  Kawich, Sundown, and Tipperary soils have significant influence from pyroclastic materials.  Sheppard soils have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR in the particle-size control section. Sundown soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 55 to 59 degrees F.  Tipper soils have paralithic contact between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  Tricera soils are noncalcareous above a depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Yenrab soils are at elevations of 4,200 to 5,000 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  These soils occur on gently to strongly sloping fan terraces, lake terraces, basin floors, lake plains, and beach bars, and are usually on stabilized dunes that occur on these landforms.  The climate is arid.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F, the mean summer temperature is 70 to 73 degrees F, and the freeze-free period is 115 to 160 days.  The average annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches."
