  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Unless artificially drained, the soil is continually saturated with water most of the year.  The soil is over 60 inches thick, but rooting depth is limited by a water during the winter months below a depth of 24 inches and is saturated to the surface for brief periods during storm periods.  The soil is over 60 inches deep to bedrock but rooting depth is limited by the water table.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The solum commonly is underlain by many feet of variegated sand, but in some places it is underlain by buried soils formed in finer textured marine sediments or organic or mineral soil material at a depth greater than 40 inches.\nThe E horizon has value of up through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy fine sand or fine sand.  The thickness varies considerably within a horizontal distance of only a few yards.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5Y to 5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Redox features are faint or distinct with hue of 2.5Y and 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6 moist.  Firm or very firm reddish colored weakly cemented nodules and thin very firm lenses are common throughout.\nThe BC horizon, when present, has color similar to the Bs horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  The Blacklock and Netarts soils are similar.  Blacklock soils are poorly drained, contain higher organic matter and have ortstein in the B horizon.  Netarts soils are well drained and lack redox features."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yaquina soils are on terraces and low interdune positions along the Oregon and Washington coastline at elevations ranging from 0 to 130 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in beach and dune sands that have been nearly leveled by wind and water action.  The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and cool, moist summers with fog. The average annual precipitation is 60 to 120 inches. The average January temperature is 41 degrees F., the average July temperature is 61 degrees F., and the average annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 300 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Depoe, Gearhart, Heceta, Nelscott, Netarts, Waldport, Warrenton and Westport soils.  Depoe soils are fine-loamy and have ortstein.  Netarts, Gearhart, Waldport and Westport soils are well or excessively drained on stabilized dunes.  Heceta and Warrenton soils are poorly drained, and lack E and Bs horizons.  Nelscott soils are moderately well drained, are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, and have a Bsm horizon."
