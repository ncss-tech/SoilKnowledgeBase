  "OVERVIEW": "The Yohn series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a mantle of interbedded sandy and silty eolian material overlying friable to firm glacial till.  Yohn soils are on till plains and hillslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches.",
