The weighted average of the control section has more than 15 percent fine sands or coarser and less than 18 percent clay.  Coarse fragment content of the lower part of the control section ranges from 35 to 50 percent.  Depth to gravelly material ranges from 16 to 37 inches.  MAST ranges from 33 to 36 degrees F.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum and is moderately acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe E horizon has moist hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, moist value of 4 or 5 and moist chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Bs horizons have moist hue from 2.5YR through 7.5YR, moist value from 3 through 5 and moist chroma from 4 through 6.  Textures include silt, silt loam, fine sand, fine sandy loam and very fine sandy loam and occur as pockets and discontinuous strata.\nThe BC and C horizons have moist value of 3 or 4 and moist chroma from 3 through 6.  Textures include silt, silt loam, fine sand, fine sandy loam and very fine sandy loam and occur as pockets and discontinuous strata.  Coarse fragments are absent in the upper part but increase to 0 to 5 percent cobble and 0 to 5 percent gravel in the lower part of these horizons.\nThe 2C horizons have moist hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, moist value of 3 or 4 and moist chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sandy loam or loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 20 percent cobble and 25 to 40 percent gravel."
