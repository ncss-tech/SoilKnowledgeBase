    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The soil is dry in all parts between depths of 6 to 19 inches from May to October.  It is moist in all parts from December to April.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 64 degrees F.  The mineralogy is mixed with high amounts of chlorite, vermiculite, and mica.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 50 percent clay and 10 to 20 percent coarse fragments.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/2, 4/3, 4/2, 4/1, 3/3, 3/2; 2.5Y 5/2, 4/2 or 3/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/3, 3/2, 3/1, 2/2, 2/1; or 2.5Y 3.2.  Particle size is loam or clay loam and averages 20 to 32 percent clay.  Reaction is moderately acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/2, 5/1, 4/3, 4/2, 4/1, 3/2; 2.5Y 6/4, 6/2, 5/4, 5/2, 4/4, 4/2; N 6/0, 5/0, 4/0; 5Y 6/3, 6/1, 5/1 or 4/4 and moist color of 10YR 5/6, 5/4, 4/1, 3/4, 3/2, 3/1, 2/1; 2.5Y 4/2, 3/2; N 4/0; 5Y 4/3, 4/2, 4/1 or 3/2.  Particle size is clay loam or clay and averages 35 to 50 percent clay and about 9 to 20 percent more clay than the A horizon.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.  In the lower part of the Bt horizon there are common faint and few distinct 10YR 6/4/or 7.5YR 6/6 mottles.  Also some pedons have a few secondary lime concretions.\nThe 2BCt horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3,5/2,4/3,4/2; 2.5Y 6/2,5/4, 5/2, 4/2; N 6/0, 4/0; 5Y 6/3, 6/1, 5/l or 4/1 and moist color of 10YR 5/4,4/2, 3/2; 2.5 Y 4/2, 3/2; N 4/0; 5Y 4/3, 4/2, 4/1 or 3/2.  Particle size is clay loam or clay and ranges from 27 to 45 percent clay and has 10 to 30 percent gravel. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a C horizon with similar colors and textures as the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Yorkville soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent, are unstable, complex, and are characterized by slips, slides, hummocky relief, sag ponds seeps and springs.  The soils formed in material weathered from chloritic schist intermixed with other sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  The underlying material is commonly altered from occurring in fault zones and is locally know as \"gouge material\".  Elevations are from 50 to 4,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 70 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 44 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 72 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 53 degrees to 59 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 125 to 270 days."

Hopland soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section and are 20 to 40 inches deep.  Squawrock soils are 20 to 40 inches deep.  Henneke and Squawrock soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the subsoil.
