  "OVERVIEW": "The Yakobi series consists of shallow, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in glacial till overlying dense compact till.  Yakobi soils are on mountainslopes, hillslopes, and till plains.  Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent   Mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F., and the mean annual percipitation is in excess of 60 inches.",

Reaction increases with depth, ranging from extremely acid to slightly acid.  Coarse fragment content in the control section ranges from 0 to 30 percent gravel. An Oe horizon is present in some pedons.  The combined thickness of the O horizons ranges from 2 to 8 inches.\nAn E horizon up to 3 inches thick may be present in 50 percent opr more of each pedon.   Hue is 7.5YR or 10YR; value ranges from 5 to 8; and chroma is 1 or 2. Texture is commonly silt loam but ranges to include sandy loam.  The coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 30 percent.  The Bh horizon has hue from 2.5YR to 10YR; value of 2.5 or 2 and chroma of 0 or 1.  Texture is commonly sandy loam but the range includes loam or silt loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 35 percent gravel.\nA Bhs horizon up to 14 inches thick is present in some pedons.  The Bhs horizon has hue from 2.5YR to 10YR; value from 2 to 3; and chroma from 1 to 3.  Texture is commonly silt loam but ranges to include sandy loam or loam.

Mottles may be present in the lower part of the Bs horizon.  Texture is commonly silt loam but ranges to include sandy loam or loam.  The coarse fragment content ranghes from 0 to 35 percent gravel.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value from 3 to 5 and chroma from 2 to 4.  Texture is commonly sandy loam but ranges to include loam or silt loam.  The coarse fragment content ranges from 15 to 35 percent gravel.
