  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Karheen and Stirfry soils. Karheen soils are on uplifted beaches and are underlain by beach gravel and have very gravelly and extremely gravelly textures below 10 inches. Stirfry soils are in drainageways, formed in mossy organic material and do not have layers of diatomaceous or coprogenous earth in the subsurface tiers."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Yamsay soils occur on slightly concave marshlands on lake beds, valley floors, channels, sag ponds and in depressional areas of lava plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. The regolith is very deep and consists of organic layers with thin layers of diatomaceous or copragenous earth overlying pumice flow materials. Elevation is 4,000 to 5,000 feet (1,220 to 1,524 meters). The climate is subhumid with 18 to 30 inches (457 to 762 millimeters) mean annual precipitation. The range in mean annual air temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F (4.4 to 7.2 degrees C), with a mean January temperature of 25 to 26 degrees F (-3.9 to -3.3 degrees C), and a mean July temperature of 57 to 59 degrees F (13.9 to 15 degrees C). The frost-free period is 10 to 25 days."

Chinchallo soils have a diatomaceous layer 14 to 40 inches thick over ashy-pumiceous material. Wocus soils are dominantly hemic material, with diatomaceous earth layers below 55 inches."
