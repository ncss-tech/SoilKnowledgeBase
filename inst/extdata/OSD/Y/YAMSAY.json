  "OVERVIEW": "The Yamsay series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in herbaceous organic material on lake beds, channels, valley floors, sag ponds and depressional areas of lava plateaus. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches/635 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F/5.6 degrees C.",

Karheen soils are on uplifted beaches and are underlain by beach gravel and have very gravelly and extremely gravelly textures below 10 inches. Stirfry soils are in drainageways, formed in mossy organic material and do not have layers of diatomaceous or coprogenous earth in the subsurface tiers."

Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. The regolith is very deep and consists of organic layers with thin layers of diatomaceous or copragenous earth overlying pumice flow materials. Elevation is 4,000 to 5,000 feet (1,220 to 1,524 meters). The climate is subhumid with 18 to 30 inches (457 to 762 millimeters) mean annual precipitation. The range in mean annual air temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F (4.4 to 7.2 degrees C), with a mean January temperature of 25 to 26 degrees F (-3.9 to -3.3 degrees C), and a mean July temperature of 57 to 59 degrees F (13.9 to 15 degrees C). The frost-free period is 10 to 25 days."
