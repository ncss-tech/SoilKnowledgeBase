  "OVERVIEW": "The Yainax series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered mainly from diatomite.  Yainax soils are on benches and pediments and have slopes of 1 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist and are dry 65 to 90 days in summer.  Depth to soft bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The solum is slightly acid or neutral.  Hard lava rock fragments average 5 to 35 percent in the argillic horizon.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  Where value is 5 dry the horizon thickness is less than 4 inches.  The A horizon has about 5 to 20 percent pebbles.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry.  Values of 6 or 7 mainly are bleached silt coatings on faces of peds and interiors.  This horizon averages 27 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.  It has 0 to 30 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles of unweathered hard lava."

Bancas, Blakeport, Bull Trail, Duzell, Hilt, Mary, Morical and Steinbeck soils have a soil temperature warmer than 47 degrees F.  Bullnell soils have hue of 10YR, 5YR or 2.5YR in the B2t horizon and are mildly to strongly alkaline and moderately or strongly calcareous in the lower part.  Delleker soils lack moist value darker than 3.5 in the upper 4 inches and are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock.  Kilfoil soils have weakly to strongly calcareous and mildly to strongly alkaline B2t horizons.  Neuske soils have bisequum profiles and are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock."

The mean January temperature is 27 degrees F., the mean July temperature is 62 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."
