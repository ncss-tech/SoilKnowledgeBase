  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Yelbrick series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in reworked alluviam derived from mixed rocks and lacustrine deposits.  The Yelbrick soils are on barrier beaches and longshore bars.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
