    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used primarily for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  This is a short and mid grass site with a good variety of forbs and a smaller woody plant component.  Major grass species are black grama, dropseed, western wheatgrass, alkali muhly, inland saltgrass, sideoats grama, and some buffalograss.  Forbs include dotted gayfeather, sensitive briar, and bush sunflower.  Cholla, prickly pear, and mesquite are the major woody species.  In extremely saline areas, vegetation is sparse.  This soil has been correlated to the Wet Saline (077CY689TX) range site in MLRA-77."
