  "OVERVIEW": "The Yellowlake series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, clayey lacustrine sediments of the Tahoka Formation of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on lake terraces 5 to 10 feet above the floors of salina basins.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 inches and mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F.",

Major grass species are black grama, dropseed, western wheatgrass, alkali muhly, inland saltgrass, sideoats grama, and some buffalograss.  Forbs include dotted gayfeather, sensitive briar, and bush sunflower.  Cholla, prickly pear, and mesquite are the major woody species.  In extremely saline areas, vegetation is sparse.
