  "OVERVIEW": "The Yaxon series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum from sandstone or schist mixed with loess in the surface. Yaxon soils are on broad summits, shoulders, hillsides, and toeslopes and have slopes of 8 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Average annual soil temperature at 20 inches depth ranges from 49 to 52 degrees F.  These soils are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 100 days following the summer solstice.  The control section averages 0 to 15 percent coarse fragments and 20 to 35 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 32 inches thick and although dark colors occur below this depth, the organic carbon content is less than 1 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.  It has weak or moderate structure.  Below 8 inches it is loam or silt loam.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist or dry.  Texture is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  Structure is moderate or strong subangular blocky.\nSome pedons have a Bk or BC horizon directly underlying the Bt.  It is loam or sandy loam and is gravelly in some pedons.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist.  Texture is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.  This horizon is absent in some pedons."

Banning soils have few to common mottles with chroma of 3 or more in the lower part of the A horizon and the upper part of the B horizon and are somewhat poorly drained.  Blockhouse soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days and have few distinct mottles in the lower part of the argillic horizon and are moderately well drained.  Coolbrith soils are dry from June 15 to November 15 and are above 41 degrees F. year around and above 47 degrees F.\nf.om April 1 to November 1.  Dotta soils are slightly acid or neutral in the upper horizons and mildly acid or moderately acid in lower horizons.   Drews soils are dry for 100 to 115 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Gorman soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 57 degrees F. and are not usually below 47 degrees F. until January.  Harriman soils have diatomaceous material in the particle-size control section.  Pumphouse soils are dry in the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Robinette soils have discontinuities in the series control section and are neutral in the argillic horizon.  Van Dusen soils have significant mica sand grains and lack hard nodules in the argillic horizon.  Waha soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Wapinitia soils are dry for 60 to 90 consecutive days and have solum thickness of 20 to 36 inches. Wockum soils are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice."
