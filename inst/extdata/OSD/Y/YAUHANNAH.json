  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  The soil is very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A horizon and very strongly acid to medium acid throughout the rest of the profile.  Flakes of mica range from few to common in the lower part of the profile of some pedons.  Mineralogy of the clay fraction is mixed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Where the value is 3, the thickness of the A or Ap horizon is less than 6 inches.  The E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The A and E horizons are loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles of chroma 2 or less are near the top of the Bt horizon and increase with depth.  Most pedons have mottles of redder hue.  In some pedons the lower part of the Bt horizon is mottled in shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray.  The Bt horizon is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy loam.  Content of silt in the particle-size control section is less than 30 percent.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 6, commonly with mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray.  In some pedons the horizon is mottled in shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon has colors similar to the BC horizon.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sand, or\nsand.  Some pedons are stratified and some pedons have pockets or strata of loamy or clayey material."

Columbus and Mollicy soils have more than 25 percent silt in the particle-size control section and are on low stream terraces subject to flooding.  Eunola soils have clay mineralogy dominated by kaolinite.  Mazarn soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Pelion soils have 10 to 60 percent brittleness in some subhorizon of the B and have clay mineralogy dominated by kaolinite.  Slagle soils have moderately slow to slow permeability in the lower part of the B horizon and have a perched high water table.  Whitwell soils have more silt in the series control section and are on low stream terraces.  Altavista, Bertie, and Tetotum soils have mixed mineralogy.  Johns soils have a thinner solum and contrasting particle-size textures.  Yemassee soils have grayer colors in the E and upper part of the B horizon."
