  "REVDATE": "04/1999",
  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Yellowbank series consists of very shallow to moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in a mantle of alluvial sediments over granite and gneiss bedrock.  These soils are on flats and side slopes on bedrock controlled terraces.  The permeability is moderate or moderately rapid above the bedrock.  Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to a lithic contact is variable, ranging from less than 20 inches in 60 to 80 percent of the area, and from 20 to 30 inches deep in 20 to 40 percent of the area.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon and depth to bedrock is 8 to 30 inches.   Content of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  The series control section ranges from 5 to 27 percent noncarbonate clay, but typically averages about 20 percent and contains more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.  It typically does not have free calcium carbonate, but a small amount is in the lower part of some pedons.  Boulders are on the surface of some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, silt loam, or sandy loam.  The reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam, or sandy loam.  The reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline."

The well drained Fordville soils are on nearly level stream terraces.  The moderately well drained Svea soils are on flats and concave foot slopes.  The poorly drained Vallers soils are on flats and in drainageways.  The moderately well drained La Prairie soils are on nearly level flood plains.  The poorly drained Lamoure soils are on nearly level flood plains.  The very poorly drained Rauville soils are along stream channels."

The depth to bedrock is variable due to common fracturing and jointing in the upper part of the bedrock surface"
