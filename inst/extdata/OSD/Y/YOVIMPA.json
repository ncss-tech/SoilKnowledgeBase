  "OVERVIEW": "The Yovimpa series consists of shallow moderately well drained soils formed in material weathered from shale and slate bedrock.  These soils are on mountainsides and ridges.  Slopes range from 5 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",

Volume of coarse fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section and are dominantly 1/2 to 1-1/2 inches in diameter.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 40 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperatures range from 54 to 58 degrees F., at the paralithic contact.  The soil is typically noncalcareous to the bedrock but the lower part of the Bt may be calcareous.  Soil reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7, 3 through 5 moist, with chroma of 3 through 6.  Textures are clay loam or clay with 35 to 45 percent clay.\nThe C horizon, if present over bedrock, has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 7, 4 or 5 moist with chroma of 1 through 4."
