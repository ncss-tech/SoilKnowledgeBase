These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with an admixture of loess.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 1,100 to 1,590 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is l00 to l20 days."
