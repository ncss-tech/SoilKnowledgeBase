  "OVERVIEW": "The Yipor series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with admixture of loess.  These soils are on inset fans, fan skirts and lake plain terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
