    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Only the upper 4 to 9 inches of the soil have moist value less than 4 after mixing.  The upper boundary of the B2t horizon occurs at depths of 13 to 24 inches.  The combined thickness of the A1, B1t, B2t and B3t horizons ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more over bedrock.  The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 41 to 43 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 56 to 58 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist, but are dry for 30 to 45 days during the late summer.  Rock fragments consist of rounded quartzite gravel, cobble and stones, and range from 20 to 60 percent in the A1 horizon and 40 to 70 percent in the B2t horizon.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry, 2 through 4 moist.  It ranges from very stony loam on the surface to very gravelly loam, gravelly loam or very cobbly sandy loam, very cobbly loam or cobbly silt loam in the lower portion.  This horizon is slightly acid or neutral and is 8 to 15 inches thick.\nThe B1t horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 6 moist.  It is gravelly or cobbly, very gravelly or very cobbly loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Structure ranges from weak or moderate fine through coarse angular blocky or subangular blocky.  Clay stripping occurs in most pedons.  This horizon is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 3 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist.  It is cobbly, very cobbly, gravelly or very gravelly heavy clay loam or clay.  Structure ranges from weak through strong fine through coarse subangular blocky or angular blocky.  Clay stripping occurs in the upper part in most pedons.  Many or continuous thin to thick clay films occur on faces of peds.  This horizon is medium acid, slightly acid or neutral and ranges from 10 to 25 inches thick."

These soils formed in glacial till from conglomerate of sandstone and quartzite deposited over sandstone and in residuum from the underlying sandstone.  The climate is humid, and the average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 35 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 39 to 41 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 55 to 57 degrees F., and the frost-free period ranges from 60 to 65 days."
