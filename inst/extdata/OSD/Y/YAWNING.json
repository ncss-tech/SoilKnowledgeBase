Dinzer and Lastance soils are deep (100 to 150 centimeters) to a lithic contact and lack andic soil properties.  Mt. Hood soils are formed from glacial till derived from porphyritic andesitic and basaltic rocks.  Ypsilon soils are somewhat excessively drained, lack andic soil properties and range in elevation from 2950 to 3350 meters."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yawning soils are found on slopes of 0 to 65 percent on valley walls, debris aprons, and terraces of glaciated mountain landscapes at elevations from 700 to 1,350 meters.  They formed in volcanic ash overlying glacial drift and colluvium from glacial drift.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,450 to 2,200 millimeters and mean annual air temperature ranges from 3 to 7 degrees C. Frost free season is 30 to 60 days."

Chilliwack soils are medial over sandy or sandy-skeletal and have a mantle of andic soil materials 25 to 35 cm thick.  Spickard soils are ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and lack albic and spodic horizon morphology.  Chilliwack and Spickard soils are typically found on more stable and lower slope gradient landscape positions.  Tepeh soils are found on more active landscape positions, have a mantle of andic soil materials 25 to 35 cm thick, and lack albic and spodic horizon morphology."
