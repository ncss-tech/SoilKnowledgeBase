  "OVERVIEW": "The Yawning series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in thin volcanic ash mantles overlying glacial drift and colluvium.  Yawning soils are found on slopes of 0 to 65 percent on debris aprons, valley walls, and terraces of glaciated mountain landscapes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,900 millimeters.  The mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
