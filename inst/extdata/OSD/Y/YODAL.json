They are derived from limestone and have mollic epipedons over calcic horizons. Koffgo soils are on nearby mountain sideslopes and commonly support forested communities. They average greater than 35 percent rock fragments throughout the particle size control section. The fragmental Typic Cryochrepts are on nearby karst alpine mountain summits. They are derived from limestone and are less than 20 inches deep to fragmental material."
