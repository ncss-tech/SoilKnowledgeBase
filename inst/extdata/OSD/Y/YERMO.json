  "OVERVIEW": "The Yermo series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed, moderately coarse textured, calcareous, gravelly or cobbly alluvium.  Yermo soils are on long, smooth, alluvial fans or uplands and have slopes of 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F.  and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F.  at any time.  The soil between the depths of about 8 and 24 inches is dry all the time from mid-spring to early winter and is not continuously moist for as long as 60 days.\nThe A horizon is pale brown, light yellowish brown, brown or yellowish brown (10YR 6/3, 6/4, 5/3, 5/4). It is cobbly sandy\nloam or gravelly sandy loam and has 15 to 25 percent gravel and 5 to 15 percent cobbles.  Structure is weak to moderate, very fine and fine subangular blocky.  This horizon is strongly calcareous to very strongly calcareous with disseminated lime, and is moderately to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon is light gray or very pale brown (10YR 7/2, 7/3). It is gravelly sandy loam and has 15 to 25 percent gravel and up to 5 percent cobbles in the upper part.  It is moderately to strongly alkaline and is strongly effervescent.  The lower part of the horizon is similar to the upper part but has 40 to 60 percent gravel and up to 15 percent cobbles."

Slopes range from from 0 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in mixed, moderately coarse textured gravelly or cobbly alluvium.  The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and cool, somewhat moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 6 inches, most of which occurs as rain in the winter.  Some moisture falls occasionally as snow. The mean annual temperature\nis 57 to 64 degrees F.; the mean January temperature is 46 degree F.; and the mean July temperature is 84 degrees F.  The frost free season is 210 to 255 days."
