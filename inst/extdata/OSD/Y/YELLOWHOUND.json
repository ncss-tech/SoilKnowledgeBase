The difference between mean summer and mean winter temperature ranges from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soil between depths of 7 to 28 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to June 1 and is dry in some or all parts from July 1 to October 1 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 30 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is strongly through slightly acid.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3 or 7.5YR 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4; 7.5YR 3/2 or 4/4.  It is gravelly loam, very gravelly loam or loam.  Where mollic colors occur the layer is too thin to meet the requirements of a mollic epipedon.  Gravel content is 10 to 55 percent.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6, 7/3, 7/4, 7/6; 7.5YR 4/4, 6/4, 6/6 or 7/6.

It is very gravelly or extremely gravelly loam, clay loam, sandy loam or sandy clay loam with 15 to 30 percent clay.  Gravel content is 35 to 80 percent.  Cobble content is 0 to 10 percent.  Base saturation (sum) is 50 to 75 percent."

The soils formed in material weathered from sandstone or conglomerate.  The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A moderate coastal fog influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation varies from 50 to 70 inches.  Mean January temperature is 50 degrees F; mean July temperature is 60 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 220 to 320 days."
