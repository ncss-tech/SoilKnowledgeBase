  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 40 to more than 72 inches.   The A and E horizons are very strongly acid to mildly alkaline.  The upper part of the B horizon is strongly acid to moderately alkaline and the lower part of the B horizon is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Ap horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 0 to 2.  The A horizon, if present, has a hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2 and is as much as 5 inches thick.  The E horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 5 through 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It commonly has masses of iron accumulation with colors of higher chroma.  The A and E horizons are loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, or neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Few to many masses of iron accumulation in colors ranging to hue of 2.5YR and chroma of 6 are in most pedons.  The particle size control section has 18 to 35 percent clay.  The texture is dominantly sandy clay loam or clay loam but ranges from sandy loam to sandy clay.\nThe BCg horizon has colors similar to the B horizon.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nSome pedons have a C horizon with colors and reaction similar to the B horizon and with textures ranging from sandy to clayey."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Tuckerman series is the only known series in the same family.  Tuckerman soils are moderately acid to very strongly acid throughout the profile.  Argent, Cherokee, Clodine, Fork, Grifton, Gourdin, Lightning, Meggett, Okeetee, Sorter, and Wadmalaw series are similar series in other families.  Argent, Cherokee, and Meggett soils have an abrupt textural change between the A and B horizons and more than 35 percent clay in the Bt horizon. Clodine and Sorter soils have less than 18 percent clay in the Bt horizon.  Fork and Okeetee soils have dominant chroma of 3 or more between the A or Ap horizon and a depth of 30 inches.  Grifton and Gourdin soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Lightning soils have more than 35 percent clay in the Bt horizon.  Wadmalaw soils have an umbric epipedon."
