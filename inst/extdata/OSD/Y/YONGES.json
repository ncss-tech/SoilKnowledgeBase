The A horizon, if present, has a hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2 and is as much as 5 inches thick.  The E horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 5 through 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It commonly has masses of iron accumulation with colors of higher chroma.  The A and E horizons are loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, or neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Few to many masses of iron accumulation in colors ranging to hue of 2.5YR and chroma of 6 are in most pedons.  The particle size control section has 18 to 35 percent clay.  The texture is dominantly sandy clay loam or clay loam but ranges from sandy loam to sandy clay.\nThe BCg horizon has colors similar to the B horizon.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nSome pedons have a C horizon with colors and reaction similar to the B horizon and with textures ranging from sandy to clayey."
