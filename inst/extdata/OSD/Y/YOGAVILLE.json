  "OVERVIEW": "The Yogaville series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils with moderate permeability on flood plains.  They formed in loamy recent alluvium derived from limestones, sandstones, siltstones, phyllites, shales, gneiss, granites, schists, and greenstones. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 57 degrees F.",

Gravel and cobble size rock fragments commonly range from 0 to 15 percent throughout the soil, but some pedons range up to 80 percent in the Cg horizon below 40 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid through neutral.\nThe Ap and A horizons have hue of 10YR through 5Y, or it is neutral; value moist of 3, value dry of 4 or 5; and chroma of 2 or 3.  They are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, or it is neutral; value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 2.  Mottles in shades of yellow, brown, or red are in most pedons.  The Bg horizon commonly is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or clay loam, and less commonly silty clay loam.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR through 5Y, or it is neutral; value of 4 through 7; and chroma of 0 through 2.  Mottles in shades of yellow, brown, or red are in most pedons. The Cg horizon is sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction."
