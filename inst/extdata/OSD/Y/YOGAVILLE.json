  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches or more.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Gravel and cobble size rock fragments commonly range from 0 to 15 percent throughout the soil, but some pedons range up to 80 percent in the Cg horizon below 40 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid through neutral.\nThe Ap and A horizons have hue of 10YR through 5Y, or it is neutral; value moist of 3, value dry of 4 or 5; and chroma of 2 or 3.  They are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, or it is neutral; value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 2.  Mottles in shades of yellow, brown, or red are in most pedons.  The Bg horizon commonly is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or clay loam, and less commonly silty clay loam.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR through 5Y, or it is neutral; value of 4 through 7; and chroma of 0 through 2.  Mottles in shades of yellow, brown, or red are in most pedons. The Cg horizon is sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction."

They formed in recent alluvium derived from limestones, sandstones, siltstones, phyllites, shales, gneiss, granites, schists, and greenstones.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 62 degrees F.  Annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches."

These soils are on flood plains.  Gray mottles are lower in the profile in Batteau soils. Chewacla, Riverview, Toccoa, and Wehadkee soils do not have thick dark surface layers.  Galtsmill and Wingina soils do not have gray mottles within 20 inches of the soil surface."
