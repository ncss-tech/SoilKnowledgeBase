Azulugar, Birdcanyon, Brazito, Cajon, Copia, Koehn, Maynard Lake, Morongo, Toquop, and Yturbide soils are all very deep with greater than 150 centimeters of mixed alluvium in the soil profile and Bluepoint, Hembrillo, and Pintura soils are greater than 150 centimeters thick forming from eolian materials. Pintura soils are derived from sandstone with hues of 5YR or 2.5YR, while Hembrillo soils are formed from gypsiferous eolian deposits. Bigcanyon and Moapa soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact and Moapa soils are formed in eolian deposits over sandstone. Bluepoint, Brazito, Cajon, Koehn, Maynard Lake, Moapa, Toquop, and Yturbide soils are effervescent throughout the particle size control section. Birdcanyon and Koehn soils are not intermittently moist in some part of the control section for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September following summer convection storms. Brazito, Copia, and Yturbide soils are intermittently moist in the control section for more than 20 days from July to October. Birdcanyon, Maynard Lake and Pintura have a mean annual soil temperature of 15 to 19 degrees C (59 to 66 degrees F). Maynard Lake soils also contain more than 20 percent pumice and volcanic ash. Copia soils are red in color with hues 2.5YR to 7.5YR."
