McCumber soils have an umbric epipedon and are not influenced by coarse and very coarse sand-size pumiceous ash. Pipp soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days after the summer solstice, are moderately to strongly acid, and have estimated clay content of 10 to 18 percent. Silentcone soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Timberbutte soils have a mollic epipedon 20 to 30 inches thick, have a cambic horizon, and do not have texture of ashy loamy sand in the particle-size control section."
