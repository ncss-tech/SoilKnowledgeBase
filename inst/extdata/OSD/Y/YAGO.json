Birchcreek, Droem, Erakatak, Leevan, Ravenswood, Roostercomb, and Sharesnout series are moderately deep.  Derringer soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.  McIvey and Yeates Hollow soils lack accumulations of carbonates.  Threek soils have accumulations of silica below the argillic and have a lithologic discontinuity."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yago soils are on mountain slopes and fan terraces and have slopes of 4 to 40 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from quartzite and sandstone.  Average annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches.  Average annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 65 to 80 days.  Elevation ranges from 5,600 to 7,000 feet."

Bancroft soils are fine-silty and are on level to gently sloping broad fan terraces.  Broadhead soils are pachic and are generally on north and east-facing concave toeslopes and fan terraces in landscape positions similar to Yago.  Camelback soils are pachic and are on north and east-facing convex slopes.  Hades soils are fine-loamy and pachic and are in mound areas with Yago soils in intermound areas of patterned ground.  Manila soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments and are generally on south and west-facing slopes in slightly concave positions where associated with Yago.  Valmar soils are loamy-skeletal and are on the upper part of slightly convex slopes and on ridgetops."
