  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum is greater than 30 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. The fragipan horizon starts at a depth of 16 to 30 inches. Rock fragments, dominantly channers and flagstones, range from 5 to 35 percent by volume in the surface layer and upper part of the subsoil, from 15 to 40 percent in the lower part of the subsoil, and from 20 to 60 percent in the substratum. The average, by volume, is less than 35 percent in the control section.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 through 4. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. It has weak or moderate, fine or medium granular or subangular blocky structure and very friable or friable consistence. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid. Thickness of the A horizon ranges from 2 to 5 inches.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6. Depth to redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less and iron accumulations is 8 to 16 inches. Texture is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky or granular. Consistence is very friable or friable. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky or platy structure. Consistence is very friable or friable. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 5, with low and high chroma redoximorphic features. Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is prismatic and/or blocky. Some subhorizons have weak platy structure. Consistence is firm or very firm, and brittle or slightly brittle. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon that has color similar to the Btx horizon and texture similar to the C horizon. Structure is prismatic or platy, or the material is massive. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. Fine earth texture is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam. Some subhorizons are silty clay. The material is massive. Consistence is firm or very firm. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Yorkshire series is the only series in this family.\nSimilar series in related families are the Bath, Lewbath, Lewbeach, Mardin, Onoville, Willdin and Willowemoc series. Bath and Mardin soils lack argillic horizons and have mesic temperature regimes. Lewbath, Lewbeach, Willdin and Willowemoc soils do not have argillic horizons. Onoville soils have an argillic horizon above the fragipan and have lower base saturation in the argillic horizon. Onoville soils formed in colluvium derived from weathered residuum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Yorkshire soils are gently sloping to steep soils on upland hilltops, ridges and valley sides. Slope ranges from 3 to 35 percent. The soils formed in Illinoian or early Wisconsin age till derived from siltstone, shale and fine-grained sandstone. Mean annual temperature ranges from 41 to 46 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches, and the mean annual frost-free season ranges from 90 to 120 days. These soils are at elevations of 1800 to 2400 feet."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The Yorkshire soils are the moderately well drained member of a drainage sequence that includes the somewhat poorly drained Napoli soils. The Almond, Ischua, Mardin, Schuyler, Salamanca, and Volusia soils are on nearby landscapes. Almond and Salamanca soils are in areas that lack argillic and fragipan horizons. Ischua soils are present where bedrock is 20 to 40 inches below the soil surface. The competing Mardin, and Schuyler and Volusia soils are at lower elevation."

Abandoned idle land is in second growth hardwoods. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods of red and white oaks, sugar maple, black cherry, beech and eastern white pine."
