  "OVERVIEW": "The Yorkshire series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in till derived from siltstone, shale and sandstone. A dense fragipan is present starting at depths of 16 to 30 inches. Permeability is moderate in the surface layer and upper part of the subsoil, and moderately slow or slow in the fragipan and substratum. These soils are on glaciated uplands at elevations above 1800 feet. Slope ranges from 3 to 35 percent. Mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.",

Bath and Mardin soils lack argillic horizons and have mesic temperature regimes. Lewbath, Lewbeach, Willdin and Willowemoc soils do not have argillic horizons. Onoville soils have an argillic horizon above the fragipan and have lower base saturation in the argillic horizon. Onoville soils formed in colluvium derived from weathered residuum."
