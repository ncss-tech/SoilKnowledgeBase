  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  With irrigation most areas are wet or moist at all times.  Nonirrigated areas have cracks 1 to 5 centimeters in width and 30 to 40 inches in depth that open and close once each year and remain open for 60 consecutive days or more during more than 7 out of 10 years.  The clay content ranges from 50 to 65 percent in the 10 to 40 inch control section.  The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 47 to 55 degrees F.  The soil is mildly to moderately alkaline and noncalcareous to weakly calcareous.  The A horizon has a dry value of 4 or 5, moist value of 2 to 3.5, and chromas of 1 or less.  The thickness of the A horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The C horizon has a dry value of 4 through 6, and a moist value of 3 through 5, and chromas of 1 or less moist or dry."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Basnaw, Cove, Coker, and Pit soils.  Basnaw soils range from slightly acid to neutral, and have yellowish red and reddish yellow mottles below 6 inches.  Cove soils lack slickensides close enough to intersect, and also wedge shaped peds with their long axis tilted as much as 10 degrees from horizontal.  Coker soils lack chromas of 1.5 or less to a depth of 40 inches.  Pit soils lack chromas of 1.5 or less to a depth of 40 inches, and are neutral to slightly acid in the upper part of the A1 horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yost soils are on nearly level bottomlands or in basins within the alluvial floodplain at an elevation of about 800 feet above sea level.  These soils formed in alluvium or lake sediments.  The basin areas are ponded during winter months and all areas have a seasonally high water table at or near the surface.  They are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters and a mean annual precipitation of 6 to 9 inches.  The average January temperature is 29 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 73 degrees F.; and the average annual temperature is 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."
