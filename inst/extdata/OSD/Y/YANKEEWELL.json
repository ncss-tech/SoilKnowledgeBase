  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yankeewell soils are on plateaus and hills.  They typically occur on summit and shoulder positions.  These soils formed in loess derived from mixed rocks over residuum derived from basalt.  These soils occur downwind of a salty playa (Summer Lake) and frequently receive new deposits of loess high in sodium salts.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,850 meters feet, but are typically 1,495 to 1,590 meters.  The highest elevations are on Diablo Peak.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

Felcher soils are loamy-skeletal, moderately deep to lithic contacts, have cambic horizons, and a mesic temperature regime.  Noidee soils are clayey and shallow to lithic contacts."
