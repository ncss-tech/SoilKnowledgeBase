  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days during summer and fall.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 55 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 45 to 60 percent rock fragments by volume.  The upper part of the argillic horizon has more than 20 percent more clay absolute than the AE horizon.  Depth to the top of the argillic horizon ranges from l5 to 2l inches.  The upper 7 to ll inches of the soil is more than 60 percent volcanic ash in the fine earth fraction.  Base saturation is assumed to range from 55 to 70 percent. Reaction is slightly acid or medium acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has a value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.\nThe 2AE horizon has a value of 3 or 4 moist.  It is a very cobbly loam, very gravelly loam, or cobbly loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist.  It is very cobbly clay, very gravelly clay, or very gravelly clay loam.  It has many moderately thick to thick clay films on faces of peds.  It has moderate to strong, prismatic, angular blocky, or subangular blocky structure."

Loneridge soils are dry in all parts in the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days during summer and fall and lack a surface mantle with greater than 60 percent volcanic ash.  Keechelus soils are dry in all parts in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days during summer and fall and lack a surface mantle that is more than 60 percent volcanic ash."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yahne soils are on mountain sides and benches and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent.  They formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt, andesite and pyroclastic rocks and a mantle of volcanic ash.  Elevations are 2,400 to 4,600 feet.  These soils are in a continental climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The average annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F and the mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F is 145 to 170 days."
