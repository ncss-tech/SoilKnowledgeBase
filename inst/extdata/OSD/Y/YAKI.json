  "OVERVIEW": "The Yaki series consists of shallow to bedrock, well drained soils that were formed in residuum weathered from limestone and shale.  These soils are on mesas and upland slopes.  Slopes are 3 to 35 percent.  The mean air annual temperature is about 55 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 11 inches.",

Scrappy soils are in the Mojave Desert of southern Nevada (MLRA 30) and are usually dry, moist in late winter and early spring and intermittently moist in the upper part following summer convection storms. Splimo soils have mean annual soil temperatures that range from 47 to 51 degrees F. Winona series have some pedons with Bw horizons, include 5YR hue in the range, and allow channers and flagstone rock fragments."

The new placement as Lithic Ustic results in a significant overlap in soil properties with the Winona series.  Additional investigation is needed to determine if there is a significant difference in concept.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
