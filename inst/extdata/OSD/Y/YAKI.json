Scrappy soils are in the Mojave Desert of southern Nevada (MLRA 30) and are usually dry, moist in late winter and early spring and intermittently moist in the upper part following summer convection storms. Splimo soils have mean annual soil temperatures that range from 47 to 51 degrees F. Winona series have some pedons with Bw horizons, include 5YR hue in the range, and allow channers and flagstone rock fragments."

These soils formed in residuum weathered from limestone and shale. The mean annual temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 73 to 79 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches.  Frost-free period is 160 to 170 days."

The new placement as Lithic Ustic results in a significant overlap in soil properties with the Winona series.  Additional investigation is needed to determine if there is a significant difference in concept.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
