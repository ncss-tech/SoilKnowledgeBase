  "OVERVIEW": "The Yelives series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium, fan alluvium and stream alluvium derived dominantly from sandstone and shale. Yelives soils are on alluvial fans on valley sides and floodplains on valley floors. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
