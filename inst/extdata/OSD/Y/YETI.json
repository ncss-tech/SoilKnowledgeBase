  "OVERVIEW": "The Yeti series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and mudstone. Yeti soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 5 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is approximately 2030 millimeters (80 inches) and the mean annual temperature is approximately 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
