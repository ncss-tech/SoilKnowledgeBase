    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Yeti soils occur on broad ridges, hillslopes and upper, mountain slopes. Slopes are 5 to 30 percent. Elevations are 3 to 395 meters (5 to 1295 feet). The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and mudstone. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1650 to 2290 millimeters (65 to 90 inches). Mean winter temperature (December, January, and February) is approximately 9 degrees C; mean summer temperature (June, July, and August) is approximately 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is 250 to 300 days."
