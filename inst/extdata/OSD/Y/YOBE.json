  "OVERVIEW": "The Yobe series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Yobe soils are on alluvial flats and lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
