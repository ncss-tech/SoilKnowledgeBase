    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at lithic contact is 47 to 54 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 90 to 100 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 12 to 20 inches and includes all of the argillic horizon.  The upper 8 to 15 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid  oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 0.7 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 27 to 33 percent clay in the fine earth fraction, more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser and 5 to 20 percent rock fragments by volume.  Organic matter is estimated to range from 2 to 3 percent in the Ap horizon or A1 horizon if present.  Solum thickness and depth to lithic contact with basalt is 12 to 20 inches.\nThe AB horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.\nThe 2Bt horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.  The 2Bt2 is a clay loam or gravelly clay loam."

Borland and Jilson soils have mollic epipedon that are less than 10 inches thick with less than 5 percent volcanic glass.  Laric soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 5 to 12 inches.  Malinda soils have 35 to 80 percent rock fragments in the A horizon with less than 5 percent volcanic glass.  Marlic soils have more than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon and are dry in the moisture control section more than half the time when soil temperature at the lithic is above 40 degrees.  McQuarrie soils have secondary carbonates in the particle-size control section and are moderately alkaline.  Pass Canyon and Terca soils lack silica accumulation on surface of bedrock, have A horizons with less than 5 percent volcanic glass, and more than 15 percent rock fragments, and have a mollic epipedon 7 to 12 inches thick."

These soils formed in loess mixed with volcanic ash in the surface, slope alluvium and some residuum from basalt.  Elevations are 2,400 to 2,800 feet.  Summers are warm and dry, winters are cool and moist.  Average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches.  Average January temperature is about 25 degrees F. average July temperature is about 69 degrees F.  Average annual temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 120 to 140 days."
