  "OVERVIEW": "The Yellowhorse series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, residuum alluvium from volcanic rock.  Yellowhorse soils are on mesas and plateaus and have slopes of 1 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
