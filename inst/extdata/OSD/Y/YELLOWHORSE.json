These soils formed in colluvium and residuum alluvium derived dominantly from basalt and other volcanic rocks.  Elevations range from 5900 to 7200 feet.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 17 to 25 inches.  The frost-free period is 120 to 135 days."
