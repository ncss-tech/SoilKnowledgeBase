(Colors are for wet soil.)\nOa1--0 to 20 inches; black (5YR 2/1) and dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) muck; about 35 percent fiber, less than 5 percent rubbed; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine, medium and coarse roots; sodium pyrophosphate extract color is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2); slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.\nOa2--20 to 29 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 2/2) muck; about 25 percent fiber, less than 5 percent rubbed; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine, medium and coarse roots; sodium pyrophosphate extract color is dark brown (10YR 4/3); neutral; gradual wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Oa horizon is 16 to 45 inches.)\nAC--29 to 32 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) mucky sand; massive; slightly sticky; few medium and coarse roots; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (2 to 8 inches thick)\nCg1--32 to 41 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sand; single grained; loose; few medium and coarse roots; common coarse distinct very dark gray (10YR 3/1) mottles and gray (10YR 6/1) areas of iron depletions; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.\nCg2--41 to 80 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) sand; single grained; loose; moderately alkaline."

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Fiber content of the organic material ranges from 20 to 75 percent unrubbed and 5 to 15 percent rubbed.  Some organic layers contain large fragments of wood.  Sodium pyrophosphate extract color has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Some pedons are underlain by limestone bedrock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the Oa horizon and from neutral to moderately alkaline in the AC and Cg horizons.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 3 or less; or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 3 or less; or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or their mucky analogs.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 7.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  Thin strata of sandy loam or sandy clay loam are present in some pedons.\nSome pedons have an R horizon at a depth of more than 40 inches.  It is hard limestone that can be chipped but not dug with a spade.  Solution holes are present in some pedons.  They range from 6 to 18 inches in diameter and from 18 to 45 inches in depth.  They are filled with sapric material in the upper part and sand, masses on secondary calcium carbonates, or limestone fragments in the lower part.  A Cr horizon may be present above the R horizon in some pedons.  It is composed of soft limestone or accumulations of soft masses of calcium carbonate with hard limestone fragments."

The soils formed in moderately deep, well-decomposed deposits of organic remains of plants.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F., and the average annual rainfall ranges from 50 to 60 inches."
