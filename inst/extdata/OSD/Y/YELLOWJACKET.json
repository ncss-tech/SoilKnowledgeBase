  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Yellowjacket series consists of very poorly drained, deep and very deep soils on flood plains and in depressions on the lower coastal plain of Northern Peninsular Florida.  They formed in highly decomposed organic materials over sandy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual air temperature is about 68 degrees F., and the mean annual rainfall is about 55 inches.  Slopes are less than 1 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Fiber content of the organic material ranges from 20 to 75 percent unrubbed and 5 to 15 percent rubbed.  Some organic layers contain large fragments of wood.  Sodium pyrophosphate extract color has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Some pedons are underlain by limestone bedrock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the Oa horizon and from neutral to moderately alkaline in the AC and Cg horizons.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 3 or less; or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 3 or less; or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or their mucky analogs.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 7.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  Thin strata of sandy loam or sandy clay loam are present in some pedons.\nSome pedons have an R horizon at a depth of more than 40 inches.  It is hard limestone that can be chipped but not dug with a spade.  Solution holes are present in some pedons.  They range from 6 to 18 inches in diameter and from 18 to 45 inches in depth.  They are filled with sapric material in the upper part and sand, masses on secondary calcium carbonates, or limestone fragments in the lower part.  A Cr horizon may be present above the R horizon in some pedons.  It is composed of soft limestone or accumulations of soft masses of calcium carbonate with hard limestone fragments."
