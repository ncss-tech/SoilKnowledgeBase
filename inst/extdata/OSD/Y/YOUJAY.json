  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock and the paralithic contact ranges from 8 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 36 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 62 degrees F.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent throughout the soil and are small channers.  Soft shale chips occur in many pedons in the lower horizons but break down upon wetting or pretreatment.  EC ranges from 2 to 4 mmhos throughout.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have lag gravel on the surface.  Reaction is mildly through strongly alkaline.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is heavy clay loam, clay, silty clay, or heavy silty clay loam with 35 to 60 percent clay.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 15 to 30 percent.  Reaction is strongly or very strongly alkaline.\nThe Btnk horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is clay, heavy clay loam, silty clay, and heavy silty clay loam with 35 to 60 percent clay.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 15 to 30 percent.  Secondary carbonates are common in soft masses and seams and tend to coat the outside of peds in some places.  The interior of peds in some pedons lacks secondary carbonate.  Reaction is strongly or very strongly alkaline.\nA Bk or C horizon is present in some pedons and has the same basic ranges as the Btnk horizon in color and reaction.  Total clay may drop off in these horizons with loams or clay loams predominating.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 10 to 25 percent in these horizons.\nThe Cr horizon consists of olive or olive sodic shale.  These shale beds are calcareous and some contain thin lenses of gypsum or salts more soluble than gypsum between shale plates.  Siltstone lenses are common in some strata.  These beds are 10 to over 100 feet in thickness."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Youjay soils are on upland parts of hillslopes and ridges and rock-controlled pediments.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvial slopewash derived from sodic shale.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Elevation is 6,000 to 7,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 9 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 36 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 60 to 90 days depending upon aspect, elevation, and local air drainage but frost can occur in any month."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Debone, Fraddle, Haterton, and Kandaly soils.  Debone soils are deep and occur more in depressions and alluvial fill positions.  Fraddle soils have less clay and less than 15 percent exchangeable sodium and occur on contiguous nonsodic deposits.  Haterton soils do not have pedogenetic natric horizons and contain less than 35 percent clay.  They occur in contiguous areas of nonsodic shale.  Kandaly soils are psamments and occur as dunes scattered about."
