  "OVERVIEW": "The Yreka series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and till derived from mixed rock sources. These soils are on alluvial fans, ridges, mountains, hills, and moraines.  Slopes are 4 to 80 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.",
