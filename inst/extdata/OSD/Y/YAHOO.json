  "OVERVIEW": "The Yahoo series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in old alluvium from mixed sources.  The Yahoo soils are on old dissected terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Arritola soils are non-calcareous above the pan, and Chiara soils are non-calcareous above 7 inches.  Chiara, Crooked, Frohman, Minveno, Otoole, Plegomir, and Scoon soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Arritola, Crooked, Plegomir, and Scoon soils have more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand in the control section.  Nevoyer soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock.  Otoole soils are somewhat poorly drained, and are strongly or very strongly alkaline.  Peeko soils have 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments, and Scoon soils have up to 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Tenvorrd soils do not have durinodes described above the duripan.  The duripan is indurated throughout, and lacks textures of very fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam below the laminar cap."
