Brays, Deskamp, Kester, and Winblow soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Chelan soils are deep to duripans.  Dryhollow soils have 5 to 15 percent pumice paragravel and 5 to 15 percent medium to very coarse sand-sized pumiceous grains.  Emagert soils have mollic epipedons greater than 61 cm thick.  Surprise soils average 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and do not have horizons with durinodes.  Yotes soils average 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Weezweed soils average 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

Elevations range from 1600 to 1900 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
