  "OVERVIEW": "The Yellowhills series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from rocks high in volcanic ash.  Yellowhills soils are on inset fans.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

Brays, Deskamp, Kester, and Winblow soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Chelan soils are deep to duripans.  Dryhollow soils have 5 to 15 percent pumice paragravel and 5 to 15 percent medium to very coarse sand-sized pumiceous grains.  Emagert soils have mollic epipedons greater than 61 cm thick.  Surprise soils average 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and do not have horizons with durinodes.  Yotes soils average 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Weezweed soils average 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section."
