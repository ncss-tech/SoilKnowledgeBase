  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Yellowbay series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in glacial outwash or alluvium.  These soils are on outwash plains, dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces, escarpments, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
