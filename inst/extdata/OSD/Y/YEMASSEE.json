  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 40 to more than 70 inches.   The soil is extremely acid to slightly acid in the A horizon and extremely acid to strongly acid in the B and C horizons.  Few to common fine flakes of mica and fine black minerals are in the lower part of the B and C horizons of many pedons.  Some pedons have few to common concretions.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or it is neutral, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Where the value is less than 3.5, the A or Ap horizon is less than 10 inches thick.  The E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Iron depletions in shades of gray, and masses of iron accumulation in shades of yellow, brown, or red are in the E horizon of some pedons.  The A and E horizons are fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 8, commonly with iron depletions in shades of gray, and masses of iron accumulation in shades of yellow, brown, or red.  The Btg horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, or is neutral, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 0 to or 2, commonly with masses of iron accumulation in shades of yellow, brown, or red.  The Bt and Btg horizons commonly are sandy clay loam but range to clay loam or sandy loam in some pedons.  Some pedons have subhorizons less than 6 inches thick of sandy clay.  Silt content in the control section is less than 30 percent.\nThe BCg horizon, present in most pedons, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or is neutral, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2, commonly with iron depletions in shades of olive, and masses of iron accumulation in shades of yellow, brown, or red.  It dominantly is sandy loam or sandy clay loam but ranges to clay loam or sandy clay. Some pedons have strata or pockets of contrasting materials.\nThe Cg horizon has the same colors given for the BCg horizon, or it is a combination of iron depletions and accumulations in shades of gray, yellow, brown, or red. Texture is variable, ranging from sandy to clayey materials.  Some pedons are stratified and some pedons have pockets of contrasting materials."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other known series in this family.  Abell, Altavista, Augusta, Bertie, Eunola, Goldsboro, Lynchburg, Ogeechee, Rains, Summerfield, Tetotum, and Yauhannah series are similar soils in other families.  Abell, Altavista, Augusta, Bertie, Summerfield, and Tetotum soils have mixed mineralogy.  Eunola, Goldsboro, and Yauhannah soils are better drained and have a matrix of higher chroma in the control section.  Lynchburg soils do not have a clay decrease of as much as 20 percent of the maximum within a depth of 60 inches from the soil surface.  Ogeechee and Rains soils are gray in 60 percent or more of the matrix between the A or Ap horizon and a depth of 30 inches."
