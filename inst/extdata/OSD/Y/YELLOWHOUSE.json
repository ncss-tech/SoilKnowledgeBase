  "OVERVIEW": "The Yellowhouse series consists of moderately deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy colluvium derived from the\nOgallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age over residuum weathered from limestone, sandstone, and shale of Cretaceous age. These soils are on gently sloping to steep escarpments and valley sides. Slope ranges from 3 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 483 millimeters (19 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
