Colma soils are deep to very deep to consolidated marine sediments, and do not have Cr or R horizons. Currymountain soils have Bt horizons with 0 to 14 percent gravel, do not have R horizons, and usually have C horizons. Dragnot soils have BC horizons with 40 to 60 percent gravel and 5 to 15 percent clay, and do not have Cr horizons. Duzel soils have lower argillic horizons with very gravelly textural modifiers, are dry 90 to 100 days in the summer, and do not have R horizons. Elkheights soils are very deep with 3Cd horizons comprised of dense glacial till. Facey soils are deep, do not have Cr horizons and are dry for 90 days in the summer. Foehlin soils are very deep and dry 80 to 110 day days in the summer. Lobitos soils have C horizons with rock fragments of shale and sandstone with 2.5Y hues, and they do not have Cr horizons. Pittvile soils are very deep with Bq horizons cemented by silica. Sagaser soils are deep and have C horizons with gravels comprised of shale fragments and they do not have R horizons."
