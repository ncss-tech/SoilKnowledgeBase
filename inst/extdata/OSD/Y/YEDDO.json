  "OVERVIEW": "The Yeddo series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loess and are underlain by loamy till at a depth of greater than 152 cm (60 inches). Yeddo soils are on till plains and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.6 degrees C (51 degrees F).",

The series is of moderate extent.\nSOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS\nSERIES ESTABLISHED: Fountain County, Indiana, 1999.\nREMARKS: These soils were originally mapped as Reesville series. Results of field investigation indicate the till is not within the solum and is below a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). These properties are outside the concept for Reesville soils. Many other areas of Reesville soils in western Indiana will likely also be converted to Yeddo series. The underlying till material is outside the series control section. In addition to occurring on till plains and outwash plains in the area of the typical pedon, these soils will likely be mapped on lake plains in unglaciated areas in Indiana and in Illinois.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (Ap and E horizons).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 23 to 86 cm (Btg, Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nAquic conditions: redox depletions and/or redox concentrations in all horizons below a depth of 20 cm.\nRepresentative NASIS data mapunit for this pedon is DMU ID 153429 in MO 11."
