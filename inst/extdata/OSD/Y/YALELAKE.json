    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 53 degrees F.  These soils are dry in the moisture control section for less than 45 consecutive days.  Thickness of the solum is 35 to 45 inches.  The ashy mantle is 17 to 25 inches thick and contains more than 60 percent volcanic ash and pumice.  Coarse fragments in the control section is 0 to 30 percent.  The umbric epipedon ranges from 10 to 13 inches thick.\nThe A and AB horizons have value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 through 7 dry and chroma of 2 through through 6 moist and dry.  It is gravelly ashy loamy sand, ashy loamy sand, gravelly ashy sandy loam or ashy sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.  It has 10 to 12 percent (estimated) 15-bar moisture (dry).\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 4 through 8 dry and moist.  It is medial sandy loam, medial loam or gravelly medial sandy loam.   Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.  It has greater than 15 percent (estimated) 15-bar moisture (dry).\nThe C horizon has value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 4 through 8 dry and moist.  It is sandy loam or loam with thin strata of loamy sand, sand or weathered pumice.  Gravel is 10 to 25 percent and paragravel pumice fragments are  15 to 40 percent.   Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.  Some pedons have an extremely gravelly sand or weathered pumice substratum below 40 inches."

Yalelake soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice over older pyroclastic deposits.  The climate is marine with cool, wet winters and warm, moist summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 115 to 125 inches.   Mean January temperature is about 35 degrees F.; mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 100 to 135 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an umbric epipedon from the mineral surface to 11 inches, a cambic horizon from 20 to 39 inches, and a lithologic change from ashy to medial soil material at 20 inches.  Field test of NaF pH is 10.0 in the A1 horizon and greater than 11.0 throughout the rest of the profile.  The particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of less than 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of more than 1 percent.  Vitrands feature - 15-bar moisture (dry) throughout 83 percent of upper 60 cm of less than 12 percent.  More investigation is needed to confirm the medial classification of the \"B\" tephra set (2Bw).\nClassificaiton changed 6/98 based on revisions to mineralogy classes in Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
