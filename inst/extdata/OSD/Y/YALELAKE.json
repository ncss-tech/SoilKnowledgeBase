  "OVERVIEW": "The Yalelake series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and pumice over pyroclastic deposits.  Yalelake soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments.  Slopes are 2 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 120 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

It is gravelly ashy loamy sand, ashy loamy sand, gravelly ashy sandy loam or ashy sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.  It has 10 to 12 percent (estimated) 15-bar moisture (dry).\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 4 through 8 dry and moist.

Field test of NaF pH is 10.0 in the A1 horizon and greater than 11.0 throughout the rest of the profile.  The particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of less than 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of more than 1 percent.  Vitrands feature - 15-bar moisture (dry) throughout 83 percent of upper 60 cm of less than 12 percent.  More investigation is needed to confirm the medial classification of the \"B\" tephra set (2Bw).\nClassificaiton changed 6/98 based on revisions to mineralogy classes in Soil Taxonomy."
