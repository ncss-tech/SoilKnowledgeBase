  "STATES": "SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Yecross series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in sandy glacial outwash sediments on uplands.  Permeability is rapid.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates typically is 8 to 10 inches but ranges from 0 to 20 inches.  Colors with moist values of less than 3.5 extend below depths of 10 inches in some pedons but lack sufficient organic carbon to qualify for mollic epipedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or sandy loam and is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of l0YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist. The control section ranges from loamy sand to coarse sand, of which more than 50 percent of the sand is medium or coarse.  Coarse fragments range from 1 to 20 percent by volume.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Thin layers of contrasting finer-textured material are below depths of 24 inches in some pedons as are thin buried A horizons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Beisigl, Blanchard, Kenray, Seroco and Zilditloi soils.  Beisigl soils are moderately deep.  Blanchard and Seroco soils contain less than 50 percent medium and coarser sand in the control section.  In addition, Seroco soils do not have carbonates within depths of 30 inches.  Kenray and Zilditloi soils are very deep to carbonates."

They formed in sandy glacial outwash sediments.  Mean annual air temperature is 40 degrees to 45 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to l8 inches."

Lehr soils have mollic epipedons and are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Maddock soils have mollic epipedons.  Wabek soils are sandy-skeletal.  Tally soils are coarse-loamy and are on nearby landscapes.  Wyndmere soils have calcic horizons and are in swales."
