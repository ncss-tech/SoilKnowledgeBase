  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yuzarra soils are on narrow, beveled summits and shoulders of ridges and hills.  They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum weathered from Tertiary granitic sandstone and fanglomerate.  The parent rock formation from which the residuum is derived is weakly cemented by crystalline calcite and contains a significant amount of limestone fragments in addition to the dominant fragments of granite, gneiss, and schist.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,600 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."
