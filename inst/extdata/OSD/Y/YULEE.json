Base  saturation exceeds 50 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizons have colors in hues of N, 5YR or 10YR, value 1 or  2, chroma 2 or less.  Texture is clay, clay loam, or sandy clay.\nThe Bg horizons have colors in hues of 10YR and 5Y, value 3  through 5, chroma 1 or 2, with mottles of yellow, brown, and red.  Texture is sandy clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 21 to 35  percent; silt content of this horizon is 10 to 20 percent.\nThe C horizon has colors in hues of 5Y, 2.5Y, 5BG, and 5GY, value  4 through 7, chroma 3 or 4.

Anclote, Astor, Bluff, Chobee, and  Manatee soils have mean annual soil temperatures of more than 72  degrees F.  In addition, Anclote and Astor soils have siliceous  mineralogy.  Astor soils have a mollic epipedon more than 24  inches thick.  Chobee, Manatee, and Stono soils have an argillic  horizon."

Mascotte, Olustee, and Sapelo  soils have a spodic horizon and an argillic horizon.  Pelham and  Yonges soils have an argillic horizon; in addition, Pelham has low  base saturation.\nDrainage and Permeability:  Yulee soils are very poorly drained.  Permeability is very slow to slow in the A and Bg horizons and very slow to moderate in the C hjorizons. The depth of the water table is less than 10 inches or is above the surface for more than 6 months.  This soil is subject to frequent flooding for long duration."
