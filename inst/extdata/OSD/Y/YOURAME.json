  "OVERVIEW": "The Yourame series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till and colluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, moraines, hills, till plains, and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
