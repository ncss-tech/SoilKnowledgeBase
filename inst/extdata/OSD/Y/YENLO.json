  "OVERVIEW": "The Yenlo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from sandstone and shale.  Yenlo soils are in upland valleys and have slopes of 1 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to calcareous material ranges from 10 to 24 inches.  Thickness of the solum to the base of the BC ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  Organic carbon in the upper 15 inches averages about 0.7 to 0.8 percent, and ranges from 0.3 to 1.2 percent.  The moisture control section is dry for 15 consecutive days from May 15 to July 15 when the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.  It is not dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice to October 20, and for at least 90 cumulative days during that period.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1.5 through 4.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is typically sandy clay loam or clay loam, but contains 20 to 30 percent clay, 5 through 35 percent silt, 40 to 75 percent sand, and more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent and are dominantly of gravel size.  This horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline and has exchange capacity of 12 to 20 milli equivalents per 100 grams of soil.\nThe C and Ck horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y.  Reaction is slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline.  Typically there is about 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the strongest part and ranges from 8 to 20 percent.  If any horizon contains over 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, it is below 40 inches."

Bowbac, Cushman, Fattig, Flaco, Gaddes, Gapbutte, Hagerman, Pokeman, Progresso, Pugsley, Spangler, and Threetop soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Buckle soils have sola over 40 inches thick.  Cerrillos, Clovis, Scholle, Tapia, Toluca, and Tuweep soils have a calcic horizon.  Cambric soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days and at least 90 cumulative days from July 15 to October 25.  Fernando soils have 50 to 80 percent silt in the solum.  Harbord and Potts soils have less than 35 percent fine and coarser sand in the control section.  Forkwood soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 consecutive days or more from July 15 to October 25.  Los Alamos soils have significant amounts of pumice and ash in the control section.  Maysdorf and Penistaja soils typically have hue of 5YR or redder in the upper part of the B2t horizon.  Millett soils typically contain more than 15 percent gravel in the control section and have hue redder than 10YR in the C horizon.  Olney soils have a mean annual soil temperature greater than 52 degrees F., and are in a climatic setting that receives 3/4 of their precipitation between April and September and have a PE Index of about 20.  Oelop soils have a C horizon with hues redder than 7.5YR.  Palacid soils have less than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  Quagwa soils have mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 57 degrees F.  Redpen soils have hue of 5YR or redder.  Selpats soils have a skeletal lithologic discontinuity at 15 to 39 inches.  Sundance soils have lithic discontinuities formed from eolian sands on top of loess and the argillic horizon formed in part, in both materials.  Teckla soils have fragmental discontinuity below the Bt with over 35 percent rock fragments."
