    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock  ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.  The content of rock fragments, which consists mainly of sandstone channers ranges from 35 to 75 percent throughout the pedon.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR and value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1.  It is the very channery analogues of sand or loamy sand.\nThe Bw horizons have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4.  They are very channery sand or extremely channery sand."

The very deep, moderately well drained Munising soils are in higher landscape positions.  The moderately deep, excessively drained Deerton soils occur on similar positions in the landscape.  Areas of poorly drained Burt soils and very poorly drained Skandia soils are in lower landscape positions and depressions.  In some places the poorly drained Burt soils are in a complex pattern with Yellowdog soils."
