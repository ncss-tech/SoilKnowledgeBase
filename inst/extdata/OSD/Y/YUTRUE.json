  "OVERVIEW": "The Yutrue series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils on\nbasalt plains.  They formed in fine textured alluvium and residuum\nderived dominantly from basalt.  Permeability is very slow.  Slopes are\n0 to 12 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches\nand the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
