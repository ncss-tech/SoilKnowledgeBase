The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 76 to 79 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hues of 5YR and 7.5YR, values of 2 and 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay loam and fine shale fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume.\nThe B horizon has hues of 5YR and 7.5YR, values of 3 and 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It ranges from shaly clay loam to very shaly silty clay loam with 35 to 85 percent shale fragments."

Adjuntas, Amones, Mayo, Pellejas, and Santa Marta soils lack a paralithic contact within 20 inches of the soil surface.  Caguabo, Malaya, and Pandura soils have base saturation of more than 50 percent.  Cuchillas soils have isothermic temperature regimes and high content of organic matter.  Descalabrado, Diamond, Juana Diaz, Mariana ,and Southgate soils have ustic soil moisture regimes.  Parcelas soils have higher COLE values and crack when dry.  Sabana soils have volcanic rock within a depth of 20 inches of the soil surface."
