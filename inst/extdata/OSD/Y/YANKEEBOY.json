  "OVERVIEW": "The Yankeeboy series consist of shallow, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from shale.  These soils are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent.   Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
