  "OVERVIEW": "The Yoder series consists of deep to very gravelly loamy coarse sand, well to somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in thin sandy medium to moderately fine textured noncalcareous alluvium derived principally from granite bedrock and arkosic deposits.  These nearly level to sloping soils are on terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 36 centimeters (14 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F.) at the type location.",
