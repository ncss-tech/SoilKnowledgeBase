Ashmed soils are effervescent in the control section and have an argillic with a SAR of 13 to 35. Bitter soils are moderately to strongly alkaline and are effervescent throughout, and do not receive appreciable summer precipitation. Blind, Bluebird, Soledad and Topowa receive more than 200 millimeters (8 inches) of precipitation a year. In addition, Blind soils have an argillic that extends past 150 centimeters (60 inches). Bluebird soils also have visible secondary carbonates in the control section while Soledad soils have less than 19 percent clay throughout the argillic and have Bk horizons below the argillic with effervescence and visible secondary carbonates. Highland and Tiefort soils are formed from colluvium and residuum from volcanic bedrock and are moderately deep to bedrock with contacts at 75 to 100 centimeters and 50 to 75 centimeters, respectively. Nellake, Twobitter and Werewolf soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. In addition, Twobitter soils are formed under desert pavement, have a thinner argillic horizon, are underlain by horizons with sand or loamy sand textures at a depth of 25 to 76 centimeters, and have a layer within the argillic horizon with visible gypsum crystals. Khyber and Timosea soils have a Btk horizon underlying the Bt horizon with strong to violent effervescence, and in the Kyber soils it has a CEC of 1 to 15 percent and 1 to 5 percent visible secondary carbonates. Timosea soils also are dry in the moisture control section between July and September."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Yuccabutte soils are on ballenas and fan remnants.  Slopes range from 4 to 50 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from granitoid and/or gneissic rocks. Elevations are from 700 to 1,175 meters (2,296 to 3,854 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 175 millimeters (4 to 7 inches); mean annual air temperature is 17 to 20 degrees C. (62 to 68 degrees F.), and the frost-free season is 270 to 320 days."

Gocougs and Pinkcan are on fan aprons over fan remnants or fan remnants and have argillic horizons with fine-loamy particle-size control sections. In addition, Gocougs soils have a calcic horizon and Pinkcan have a duripan with an upper boundary between 100 and 150 centimeters from the soil surface. Grubstake and Stranger soils are on adjacent pediments and are shallow to bedrock. Werewolf soils are on fan remnants and have an argillic horizon with less than 18 percent clay."
