  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F.  Soils are usually moist but are dry about 75 to 90 days in the 4-month period following the summer solstice.  Depth to the duripan ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 moist and 1 or 2 dry.\nThe B2t horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist in the upper part and 3 or 4 in the lower part, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It has 35 to 50 percent clay and 20 to 40 percent sand.  This horizon averages 5 to 25 percent gravel.  Some pedons have up to 40 percent gravel in the lower part.\nDuripans range from 1 to more than 4 feet in thickness and have indurated opaline caps 1 millimeter to more than 1 centimeter thick."

Also, the Bieber soils are usually dry and the Hibbard, Oxbow and Salisbury soils have duripans at depths over 20 inches.  Espil soils are usually dry and have duripans at depths of 8 to 14 inches.  Powley soils are usually dry, have A2 horizons and have A&B horizons with uncoated sand grains on faces of peds.  Tanner soils have bedrock at depths less than 40 inches and a duripan immediately above bedrock but deeper than 20 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yancy soils are on old high terraces, tablelands and benches.  Elevations are 4,200 to 5,500 feet.  The soils formed in gravelly sediments weathered from basalt, tuff, and felsite.  The climate is subhumid with cool dry summers and cold moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches.  The mean January temperature is 27 degrees F., the mean July temperature is 63 degrees F., and the average annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 50 to 70 days."
