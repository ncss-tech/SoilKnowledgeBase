Buffstat soils are deep to paralithic contact.  Casville soils formed in residuum from felsic or intermediate igneous or metamorphic rock.  Clover soils formed in residuum from Triassic age materials. Danripple soils formed in old alluvium on stream terraces of the piedmont.  Diana Mills soils are deep to paralithic contact.  Littlejoe and Mount Rush (tentative) soils are moderately deep to paralithic contact.  Lodi soils form in residuum from limestone.  Penhook soils have a redder subsoil.  Strawfield soils are moderately deep to lithic contact.  Warminster soils are deep to paralithic contact and formed in residuum of Triasic red shale."
