  "OVERVIEW": "The Yellowbottom series consists of very deep, well-drained soils, with moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity, on uplands in the northern piedmont province. The soils formed in residuum of sericite schist, phyllonite, and metamonzagranite. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees f.",

Clover soils formed in residuum from Triassic age materials. Danripple soils formed in old alluvium on stream terraces of the piedmont.  Diana Mills soils are deep to paralithic contact.  Littlejoe and Mount Rush (tentative) soils are moderately deep to paralithic contact.  Lodi soils form in residuum from limestone.  Penhook soils have a redder subsoil.  Strawfield soils are moderately deep to lithic contact.  Warminster soils are deep to paralithic contact and formed in residuum of Triasic red shale."

C horizons may have subhorizons of silty clay or clay in some pedons.  The soil horizon depths were revised on 10/2021 to ensure the description began at the soil surface.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon - from the surface to 9 inches (O, Ap and E horizons)\n2) Argillic horizon - from 9 to 37 inches."
