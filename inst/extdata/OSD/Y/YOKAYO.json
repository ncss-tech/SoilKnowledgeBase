Base saturation is greater than 75 percent throughout the Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 6/2, 6/3, or 6/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/4, or 5/6.  It is sandy loam with 12 to 20 percent clay, 2 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles. It is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 7/3, 7/4, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6; 2.5Y 7/4 or 6/4.
