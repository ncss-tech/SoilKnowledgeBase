    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches.   Depth to siltstone ranges from 22 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 60 degrees to 65 degrees F.  The soil temperature is above 47 degrees F. the entire year.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 30 degrees to 33 degrees F.  The soil between depths of 6 and 18 inches is usually dry in all parts from June through October and is moist in some or all parts from November through May.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/3 or 6/4, and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3 or 3/4.  It is moderately acid to neutral.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 27 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 8/4, 6/4 or 5/6 and moist color of 7.5YR 4/3, 4/4; 5YR 4/6 or 3/3.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Clay content ranges from 40 to 60 percent.  The transition between the A and Bt horizon is abrupt with greater than 15 percent (absolute) more clay in the upper 1 inch of the Bt horizon than in an A horizon.\nThe duripan has dry color of 10YR 7/4, 7/6 or 4/4.  It is continuously indurated with a 1 to 5 mm laminar silica cap, and has laminar accumulations of CaC03 above it."
