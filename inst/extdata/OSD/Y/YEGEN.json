  "OVERVIEW": "The Yegen series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in thick alluvial or eolian deposits.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Bullflat soils have a discontinuity above 40 inches.  Cortyzack, Lairfield, Martinsdale, Trag, and Ulrant soils have a calcic horizon.  Empedrado and Livona soils are more than 20 inches deep to lime.  The Farnuf soils have less than 35 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  Lefor and Greenway soils have a discontinuity in the argillic horizon.  Hyalite soils have a skeletal discontinuity above 40 inches.  The Gurney, Maudlin, Moen, and Watrous soils have a lithic contact between depths of 20 to 40 inches.  The Beeno, Lifor, Lininger, Reeder, and Wemple soils have a paralithic contact between depths of 20 to 40 inches.
