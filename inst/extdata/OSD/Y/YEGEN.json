The Bielenberg soils do not have carbonates above 60 inches.  Bookcliff soils have hard sandstone between depths of 40 and 60 inches and the depth to carbonates is 20 inches or less.  Bullflat soils have a discontinuity above 40 inches.  Cortyzack, Lairfield, Martinsdale, Trag, and Ulrant soils have a calcic horizon.  Empedrado and Livona soils are more than 20 inches deep to lime.  The Farnuf soils have less than 35 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  Lefor and Greenway soils have a discontinuity in the argillic horizon.  Hyalite soils have a skeletal discontinuity above 40 inches.  The Gurney, Maudlin, Moen, and Watrous soils have a lithic contact between depths of 20 to 40 inches.  The Beeno, Lifor, Lininger, Reeder, and Wemple soils have a paralithic contact between depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Hangdo soils have hues redder than 10YR throughout the profile and are mildly or moderately alkaline.  Krem soils have a sandy epipedon 20 to 40 inches thick.  Sponseller soils have hues redder than 10YR throughout the soil and have less than 45 percent sand in the argillic horizon.  Tschicoma soils have rock fragments that are mainly stones to a depth of 40 inches and have argillic horizons that have hues of 7.5YR."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Yegen soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, and sedimentary plains.  Elevations are 1,900 to 4,500 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in thick alluvial or eolian deposits.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist spring; and warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 13 to 19 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 105 to 135 days."
