  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Yana soils are on nearly level to gently sloping alluvial fans and terraces.  The soils formed in moderately coarse to medium texture sediments of mixed mineralogy.  These soils rarely receive additional water from surrounding areas of higher elevation.  The climate is semiarid continental.  At the type location the annual temperature is 61 degrees F. and the annual precipitation is 10 inches with a summer maximum.  The Thornthwaite P-E Index is 13."
