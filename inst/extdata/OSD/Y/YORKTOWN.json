  "STATES": "AR,LA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Yorktown series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium. These level to depressional soils are in back swamps, sloughs and abandon oxbows of the Arkansas River, Red River and their tributaries; MLRA 131. Slopes range form 0 to 1 percent. These soils are typically ponded with water, 6 inches to 5 feet deep, for 10 or more months in a normal year.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 50 to 80 inches. Depth to the Bw horizon ranges from 40 to 60 inches but typically is 40 to 50 inches. The A and Bg horizons range from moderately acid to neutral. The Bw horizon is mildly or moderately alkaline. Some pedons have Bw horizons that are\ncalcareous and contain few to many, fine to coarse, carbonate concretions. The average clay content of the 10- to 40-inch control section is 60 to 85 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is Neutral, with value of 4 to 6. Masses of iron and /or manganese accumulation are in shades of red, brown or black. Texture is silty clay or clay.\nThe Bg1 and Bg2 horizons hve hue of 10YR or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1, or is Neutral with value of 4 to 6. Prominent masses of iron and/or manganese accumulation are in shades of red, brown or black. Texture is clay\nThe Bg3 horizon has hue of 10YR, 5Y, 5G, or 5BG, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1, or is Neutral, with value of 4 to 6. Prominent masses of iron and/or manganese accumulation are in shades of red, brown or black. Masses of iron-manganese accumulations decrease with depth.Texture is clay\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Prominent iron depletions are in shades of gray. The iron depletions generally decrease in number with depth. The Bw horizon has moderate or strong blocky structure with few to many, fine pressure faces.\nSome pedons may have a 2BC or 2C horizon with colors and textures similar to the Bw horizon."
