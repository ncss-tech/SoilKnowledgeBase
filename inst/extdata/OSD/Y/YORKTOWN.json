  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 50 to 80 inches. Depth to the Bw horizon ranges from 40 to 60 inches but typically is 40 to 50 inches. The A and Bg horizons range from moderately acid to neutral. The Bw horizon is mildly or moderately alkaline. Some pedons have Bw horizons that are\ncalcareous and contain few to many, fine to coarse, carbonate concretions. The average clay content of the 10- to 40-inch control section is 60 to 85 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is Neutral, with value of 4 to 6. Masses of iron and /or manganese accumulation are in shades of red, brown or black. Texture is silty clay or clay.\nThe Bg1 and Bg2 horizons hve hue of 10YR or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1, or is Neutral with value of 4 to 6. Prominent masses of iron and/or manganese accumulation are in shades of red, brown or black. Texture is clay\nThe Bg3 horizon has hue of 10YR, 5Y, 5G, or 5BG, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1, or is Neutral, with value of 4 to 6. Prominent masses of iron and/or manganese accumulation are in shades of red, brown or black. Masses of iron-manganese accumulations decrease with depth.Texture is clay\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Prominent iron depletions are in shades of gray. The iron depletions generally decrease in number with depth. The Bw horizon has moderate or strong blocky structure with few to many, fine pressure faces.\nSome pedons may have a 2BC or 2C horizon with colors and textures similar to the Bw horizon."

Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. These soils are ponded at least 10 months of most years with from 6 inches to 5 feet of water. Near the type\nlocation, the average annual temperature is 65 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is 51 inches."

    "content": "REMARKS: These soils have a very high shrink-swell potential but do not crack because they are wet most of the time. The Yorktown series was formerly considered as part of the water areas of shallow lakes and clayey swamps. The series would have been classified in the Alluvial great soil group\nADDITIONAL DATA: Organic carbon analysis by the University of Arkansas Soil Characterization Laboratory on one pedon is as follows:\n0-8 inches -- 2.15%\n8-24 inches -- 1.40%\n24-35 inches -- 1.45%\n35-42 inches -- 0.65%\n42-60 inches -- 0.55%\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
