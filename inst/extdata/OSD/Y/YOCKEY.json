  "OVERVIEW": "The Yockey series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in stratified, calcareous loamy alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.) and mean annual precipitation is about 43 centimeters (17 inches) at the type location.",
