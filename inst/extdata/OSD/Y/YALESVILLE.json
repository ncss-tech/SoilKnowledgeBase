  "OVERVIEW": "The Yalesville series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in a loamy till.  They are nearly level to moderately steep soils on hills and ridges.  Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent.  Saturated hydraulic conductivy is moderately high or high in the solum and high in the substratum.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 51 to 102 cm.  Mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C and mean annual precipitation is about 1194 mm.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 46 to 91 cm.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 51 to 102 cm.  Rock fragments range from 2 to 35 percent by volume in the solum and from 5 to 70 percent in the C horizon.  Typically, 60 percent or more of the rock fragments are subrounded gravel or channers.  Unless limed, the soil ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have O horizons.  In lieu texture ranges from slightly decomposed plant material to highly decomposed plant material.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Dry value is 6 or more.  Undisturbed pedons have a thin A horizon with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.  The A or Ap horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It has weak or moderate granular structure and is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10R, 2.5YR, or 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.  The Bw horizon commonly has weak or moderate subangular blocky or granular structure, or it is massive.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with similar properties to the Bw horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10R, 2.5YR, or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.  The horizon is massive and consistence is very friable to firm.\nSome pedons have a thin Cr horizon just above the bedrock."

Ashe, Buladean, Chestnut, Edneyville, Gallimore, Soco, and Stecoah, soils are from outside LRR R.\nAshe, Cardigan, and Lordstown soils have 7.5YR or yellower hue in the B horizon.  Brookfield, Charlton, Chestnut, Delaware, Dutchess, Edneyville, Foresthills (T), Gallimore, Greenbelt (T), Nantucket, Newport, Paxton, Pollux, Riverhead, and St. Albans soils are deeper than 40 inches to hard bedrock.  Buladean, Soco, and Stecoah soils have a paralithic contact with weathered bedrock at less than 60 inches depth.  Wakeman soils are sandy and loamy residuum over sandstone."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Yalesville soils are nearly level to moderately steep soils on bedrock controlled hills and ridges.  Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent, but commonly is 8 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in acid till derived mostly from red sandstone, shale, and conglomerate with some basalt.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 12 degrees C, mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1270 mm, and the growing season ranges from 130 to 185 days."

Well drained Cheshire and Wethersfield soils, moderately well drained Ludlow and Watchaug soils, poorly drained Wilbraham soils, and very poorly drained Menlo soils are on landscapes where the soil is deeper than 152 cm. Holyoke soils are on ridges where the underlying bedrock is between 25 and 51 cm deep.  Somewhat poorly drained Bash soils are on floodplains.  Berlin soils are fine-textured and are on glaciolacustrine terraces.  Branford, Ellington, Hartford, Manchester, and Penwood soils are terrace associates formed in stratified glaciofluvial deposits."
