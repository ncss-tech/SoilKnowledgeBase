  "OVERVIEW": "The Yochum series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from red bed sandstones and loamstones. These soils are on hills, ridges, and mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.",
