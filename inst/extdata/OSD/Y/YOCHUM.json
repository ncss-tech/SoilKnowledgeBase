  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 40 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is about 51 degrees F. A thin dark colored Al horizon is present in some pedons.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent in all subhorizons of the argillic horizon.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the top of the argillic horizon is less than 24 inches and depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 17 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 75 percent in a major part of the solum and any C horizon and are mainly 1/4 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A1 horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is variable in texture with the horizon consisting of lamellae of sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam or clay loam in a matrix of sandy loam.  If mixed proportionally to occurrence within the pedon the composite texture of the fine earth fraction is finer than loamy fine sand. This horizon ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon, if present above the bedrock, has hue of 5YR through 10R.   It is typically gravelly or very gravelly sandy loam.  This horizon ranges from medium acid to neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yochum soils are on gently to steeply sloping hills, ridges, and mountainsides.  Slopes typically range from about 2 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in moderately thin reddish brown gravelly sandy loam materials weathered from red bed sandstones and loamstones.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  Mean annual temperature is 36 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 52 degrees F."
