  "OVERVIEW": "The Ymark series consists of well drained soils that are deep to grus and hard granite bedrock.  These soils formed in colluvium derived from hard fine grained and coarse grained igneous rock deposited over hard granite bedrock.   They are on alluvial fans, ridges and sideslopes of hills and mountains. Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
