It is very strongly or strongly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel in the upper part and up to 30 percent gravel in the lower part.  It is clay or gravelly clay.  It is strongly to slightly acid."
