Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above depth of 40 inches and are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter but range from 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter.  The solum and C horizon range from slightly acid through mildly alkaline.  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 45 degrees F.  with an 0 horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R, 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically heavy clay loam or clay and has 35 to 50 percent clay, 5 to 45 percent silt and 15 to 55 percent sand with more than 15 percent being fine or coarser sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R.  It is typically heavy clay loam or clay and averages more than 35 percent clay to depth of at least 50 inches."

Arling soils have a significant component of volcanic ash and other pyroclastics. Brinkert soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower and have C horizons with less than 35 percent clay.  Brolliar, Judy, Little Horn, Sneffels, and Waters soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Buckskin and Sessions soils have sola more than 50 inches thick.  Florissant, Mayoworth, Owen Creek, and Trout Creek soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Getta and Gothic soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower.  Gurney soils have coarse fragments that are mainly larger than 10 inches in diameter.  Heath and Jerry soils are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon and have continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate.  Needleton soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower, have C horizons with less than 35 percent clay, and have coarse fragments that effervesce in acid throughout a noncalcareous matrix.  Segal soils have an abrupt textural boundary between the A and B horizons and have hue of 7.5YR or yellower."

The soils formed in parent materials derived principally from igneous rocks including rhyolite, tuff, and latite.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 20 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the spring and summer.  The mean annual temperature is 36 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 54 degrees F."
