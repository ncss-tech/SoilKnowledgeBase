Under recent forest encrouchment and where there is open stands of large trees, the A1 tends to lose its brownish color and becomes dark gray, dry, and black, moist (chroma 1).\nThe Bw horizon colors have a hue range of 10YR and 7.5YR with chroma 3 to 4 in the former and mostly 3 in the latter. Where deepest, a B3 usually lies below the Bw."
