  "OVERVIEW": "The Yeoman series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in medium textured calcareous glacial till containing argillite, quartzite and dolomitic limestone rocks of the Belt geological formation. Yeoman soils are on moraines in valleys, on valley sides or mountain footslopes. Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 17 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Silt loam, gravelly loam and stony loam types are recognized. The depth to the Bk ranges from 22 to about 36 inches. Under recent forest encrouchment and where there is open stands of large trees, the A1 tends to lose its brownish color and becomes dark gray, dry, and black, moist (chroma 1).\nThe Bw horizon colors have a hue range of 10YR and 7.5YR with chroma 3 to 4 in the former and mostly 3 in the latter. Where deepest, a B3 usually lies below the Bw."
