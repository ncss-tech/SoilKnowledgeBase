    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are dry less than 45 consecutive days between the depths of 4 and 12 inches following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. Under native vegetation the difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F.  It is extremely acid to strongly acid throughout.  The umbric epipedon is from 10 to 20 inches thick. The particl-size control section averages 5 to 15 percent clay and more than 15 percent sand that is coarser than very fine sand.  Organic carbon decreases irregularly throughout the profile.\nThe Ap and A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam and has 5 to 18 percent clay.  It has 4 to 8 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon, when present, has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  I tis very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy fine sand.  It has 5 to 10 percent clay.  Stratified sandy or gravelly layers may occur in some pedons."
