The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. Under native vegetation the difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F.  It is extremely acid to strongly acid throughout.  The umbric epipedon is from 10 to 20 inches thick. The particl-size control section averages 5 to 15 percent clay and more than 15 percent sand that is coarser than very fine sand.  Organic carbon decreases irregularly throughout the profile.\nThe Ap and A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam and has 5 to 18 percent clay.  It has 4 to 8 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon, when present, has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  I tis very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy fine sand.  It has 5 to 10 percent clay.  Stratified sandy or gravelly layers may occur in some pedons."
