  "OVERVIEW": "The Yacolt series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with glacial drift on terraces at an elevation of 400 to 1,100 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 85 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
