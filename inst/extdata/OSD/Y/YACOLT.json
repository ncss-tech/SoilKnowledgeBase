These soils occur in a hum,id climate having an average annual precipitation of about 85 inches with relatively cool, dry summers and mild, wet winters; with an average January temperature of about 32 degrees F, an average July temperature of about 65 degrees F, a mean annual temperature of about 49 degrees F, and a growing season of about 137 days."
