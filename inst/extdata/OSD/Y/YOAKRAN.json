  "OVERVIEW": "The Yoakran series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils. The soils formed in sandy, eolian sediments of the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These soils occur on nearly level to gently sloping plains and interdunes. Slope range is 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 432 mm (17 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61degrees F).",
