  "OVERVIEW": "The Yoakran series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils.  The soils formed in sandy, eolian sediments of the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age.  These soils occur on nearly level to gently sloping plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F.",
