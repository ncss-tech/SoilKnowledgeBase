  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 51 to 54 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 69 to 72 degrees F.\nThe salt accumulation layer (salic horizon) occurs at depths of 0 to 40 inches.  Salt content ranges from 0.3 to 3.5 percent in the profile. Exchangeable sodium is estimated to range from 15 to 60 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has weak or moderate fine granular, moderate thin platy or moderate coarse subangular blocky structure.  This horizon ranges from moderately to very strongly alkaline.\nThe Bw and C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3, but predominantly 1 or 2.  The 10 to 40 inch control section is silty clay loam or silty clay and averages 35 to 50 percent clay.  The C horizon has weak fine medium or coarse subangular blocky to moderate medium subangular blocky structure or is massive.  It ranges from moderately to very strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Yuba soils are on nearly level lake terraces at elevations of 4,600 to 4,700 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in mixed lake sediments derived from igneous and sedimentary rocks.  The climate is arid.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 49 to 52 degrees F., the mean summer temperature ranges from 70 to 73 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 115 to 120 days.  Average annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches."

Abbott soils have distinct or prominent mottles at depths of less than 20 inches or have chroma of 1.  Swasey soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Uffens soils are sandy clay loam in the control section and have a natric horizon."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nThis series was last reviewed in the field in 1970. Pending classification issues involve the need to determine if the soil is saturated within 100 cm for 1 month or more in some years. This is based on the mottles described from 12 to 46 inches. The combination of saturation and a salic horizon would result in a Salid placement. The National Soil Information System data for the type location support the current Orthent placement. Apparently the described structure in the C horizons was assumed to be pressure faces of the fine textured lake sediments.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
