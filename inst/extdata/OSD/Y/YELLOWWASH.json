  "OVERVIEW": "The Yellowwash series consists of very shallow or shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum derived from siltstone.  Yellowwash soils are on hillslopes. Slopes range from 5 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Depth to the lithic contact ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  The soil is calcareous throughout.  The control section is typically a channery loam or loam and averages 18 to 27 percent clay, 30 to 50 percent silt, and 30 to 50 percent sand.  Content of channery fragments ranges from 10 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and a chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe AC or C horizons have a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and a chroma of 3 or 4."
