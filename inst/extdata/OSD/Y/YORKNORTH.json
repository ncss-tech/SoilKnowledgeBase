    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Yorknorth soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent. Yorknorth soils are on concave to linear slopes. Elevations range from 60 to 760 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum. Landscapes dominated by Yorknorth soils have hummocky relief, sag ponds, slips, and intermittent springs. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1525 to 2160 millimeters. Mean January temperature is about 11 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 21 degrees C, and the mean annual temperature is 13 to 15 degrees C. Frost free period is about 240 to 280 days."
