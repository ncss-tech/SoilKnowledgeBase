  "OVERVIEW": "The Yorknorth series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in material weathered from chloritic schist and other sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Yorknorth soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1650 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C.",
