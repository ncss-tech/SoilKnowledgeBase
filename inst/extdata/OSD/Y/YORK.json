  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the York series are deep and moderately well drained with moderately slow permeability.  They formed in the weathered product of acid rock mostly sericite schist.  These soils are on uplands of the Piedmont Province.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is above 59 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches.",
