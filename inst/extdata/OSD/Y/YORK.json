Flakes of mica are in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, chroma of 2 through 6.  The A horizon is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 6, mottles with chromas of 2 or less may be present below the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  The B2t horizon is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam or clay loam.  Silt plus very fine sand is more than 40 percent.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma 2 through 6.  The Bx horizon is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.\nThe B3 and the C horizons are multicolored and are silt loam, silty clay loam or loam."

Bourne soils do not have coarse fragments or have rounded quartz pebbles and do not have sericite schist coarse fragments or have rounded quartz pebbles and do not have sericite schist coarse fragments.\nThe Beltsville, Cane, Colfax, Gills, Fairfax, Ora and Savanna series are in closely related families.  Beltsville soils have mean annual soil temperatures of less than 59 degrees F.  Cane, Ora and Savanna soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Colfax soils have mottles with chromas of 2 or less within the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  Gills soils have clayey B2t horizons above the fragipan.  Fairfax soils do not have a fragipan."
