    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 33 to 36 degrees F.  Depth to sand and gravel ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  Texture of the loess mantle is silt loam with less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly acid in the loess cap and slightly acid or neutral in the substratum.\nThe A and AC horizons have moist hue from 10YR or 2.5Y; value moist from 2 through 4; and chroma moist of 2 or 3.  Occasional thin strata of darker colors (buried O horizons and charcoal) occur throughout these horizons.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe buried Bw/C horizons have two dominant color groups.  The Bw portion has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; chroma moist from 4 through 6.  The C portion has has hue from 10YR through 5Y; chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Occasional thin strata of darker colors (buried O horizons and charcoal) occur throughout these horizons.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bwb horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; chroma moist from 4 to 6; Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe BCb or C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR; value moist of 3 or 4; chroma moist of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizons have variegated colors.  Textures include sand and coarse sand with 40 to 70 percent gravel and cobble."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Yensus soils are on stream terraces outwash plains and hills.  They formed in a loess mantle overlying glaciofluvial deposits of sand and gravel.  The loess is dominantly glacial flour from active glacial outwash plains.  The climate is transitional maritime-continental.  Mean annual temperature is 35 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 17 inches."
