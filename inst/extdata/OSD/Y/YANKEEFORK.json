  "OVERVIEW": "The Yankeefork series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial outwash and alluvium.  Yankeefork soils are on outwash fans, fan terraces, and stream terraces.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part of the profile. Slopes are 2 to 6  percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the average annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",

The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
