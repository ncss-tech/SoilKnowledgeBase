  "OVERVIEW": "The Yokohl Series is a member of a fine, montmorillonitic, thermic family of Typic Durixeralfs. The soils have reddish brown, clay loam A horizons, reddish brown, clay Bt horizons abruptly overlying reddish brown duripans. The soils are developed on  alluvium from basic igneous rocks.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils have ochric epipedons (massive and hard dry and/or chromas of 4 or more) argillic horizon and duripan. The soils are usually moist but dry for 60 consecutive days in the summer.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 72 degrees F.  Mineralogy is montmorillonitic. The solum thickness is 10 to 27 inches to the duripan. Differences in thickness and texture of the profile correspond to differences in micro-relief. The soils on the mounds are thicker and slightly coarser in texture than soils in the intermound areas. Depth to the hardpan is variable in color from brown, dark brown, reddish brown to dark reddish brown (7.5YR 5/4, 4/3; 5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/3); in texture from fine sandy loam to heavy loam; in reaction from medium acid to mild alkaline (pH 6.0-7.4). Structure is massive to blocky and consistence is hard to very hard. The B2t horizon ranges in color from reddish brown and dark reddish brown in 5YR and 2.5YR hues with values of 3 and 4 and chromas of 4 to 6; in texture from heavy clay loam and clay to gravel and/or cobbly clay; in reaction from medium to mildly alkaline (pH 6.0-7.4). Structure is strong blocky medium to strong prismatic and consistence is very hard to extremely hard. The Cm horizons range in color from light brown to light red and dark red (7.5YR to 2.5YR). The Cm is indurated and contains seams of lime and is usually gravelly. It ranges in color from light brown, reddish yellow, to dark red in 7.5YR to 2.5YR hues. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline. The parent material usually consists of moderately coarse or medium textured\nstratified alluvium."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These include in the same family Jesbel, Keyes, Madera and Tuscan. The Jesbel soils have dark grayish brown A horizons, dark brown sandy clay Bt horizons and white duripans which are lime-silica cemented. The Keyes soils have grayish brown A and B horizons. The Madera soils have light yellowish brown to yellowish brown A and B horizons. The Tuscan soils lack abrupt AB boundary and are slightly to medium acid throughout. Similar soils in                     another subgroup are Redding, San Joaquin, Gloria and Palo Cedro. These soils have abrupt AB boundaries With 15 percent clay increase within 1 inch, and Bt horizons have more than 35 percent clay in all parts."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Yokohl soils occur on gently sloping old fans and terraces on alluvium from dominately basic igneous rock. They occur at elevations of less than 500 feet, in a semiarid, mesothermal climate with mean annual                     rainfall of 10 to 15 inches, with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F., average January temperature about 45 degrees F., and average July temperature about 79 degrees F. Frost-free\nseason averages about 260 days."
