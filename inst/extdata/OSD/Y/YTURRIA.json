  "OVERVIEW": "The Yturria series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapid permeable soils that formed in loamy sediments.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping blowout dunes on vegetated sandsheet.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 23 degrees C (73 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 in).",
