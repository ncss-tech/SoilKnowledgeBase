(Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon:  The zone from 33 to 43 inches.  (Bk1 horizon)\nOther features:  Ustic aridic moisture regime\nRemarks:  Calcium carbonate equivalent was obtained from field measurements. This soil was originally considered to be in the Yarts series.  Changes in soil taxonomy and the identification of consistent visible calcium carbonate in the control section resulted in a change to Ustic Haplocalcids.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Second Edition, 1999\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
