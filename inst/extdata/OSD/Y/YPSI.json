Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Mean summer temperature is about 21.1 degrees C (70 degrees F)."

They are associated with the Nappanee and Hoytville soils on ground moraines and the Fulton and Toledo soils on lake plains. The Nappanee, Hoytville, Fulton, and Toledo soils are not loamy sand or sandy loam in the upper part of the control section."
