  "OVERVIEW": "The Yettem series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from granitic sources.  Yettem soils are on alluvial fans and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.",
