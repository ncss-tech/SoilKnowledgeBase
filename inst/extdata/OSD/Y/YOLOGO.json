  "OVERVIEW": "The Yologo series consists of soils that are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon.  They are well drained, moderately permeable soils on uplands.  These gently undulating to undulating soils formed in very gravelly loamy sediments.  Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",
