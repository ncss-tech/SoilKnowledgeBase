Kirkville soils are not dry in some part of the moisture control section for more than 60 cumulative days in most years. Hannahatchee, Laneville, and Marietta soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Iuka soils do not have a cambic horizon. Owentown soils do not have aquic conditions or iron depletions within 24 inches of the soil surface. Thenas soils have mixed mineralogy."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Iulus soils are moderately well drained, and moderately permeable with low runoff. The soil is wet in all layers below a depth of 1.5 to 4 feet, mainly during the winter and spring seasons in normal years. The water table is present for very brief to brief periods with a cumulative duration of 1 to 2 months during most years. These soils are commonly flooded. Typically, they flood 1 to 3 times during most years. Periods of flooding are very brief to brief."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for pastureland or woodland. Native pastures are most common. Native grasses include Florida paspalum, Virginia wildrye, switchgrass, various panicums and longleaf uniola. Improved pastures consists of bahiagrass, common bermudagrass, and improved bermudagrass. Pastures are typically overseeded with white clover, crimson clover or arrowleaf clover. Native woodland is mainly loblolly or shortleaf pine mixed with oak, gum and hickory."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly included in the Iuka Series. However, they have a cambic horizon and classify as Inceptisols rather than Entisols. The series was updated in 2002 to allow extremely acid reaction and thin sandy overwash layers or subhorizons. The series was updated in 2004 to allow a Bw' horizon, with matrix chroma 3 or more, to occur below the Bg horizon in some pedons.\nDiagnostic Horizons and Features recognized in the type location pedon include:\nOchric epipedon -- 0 to 7 inches (A horizon)\nAquic conditions -- Saturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features beginning at a depth 18 inches\nCambic Horizon --- 7 to 62 inches (Bw and Bg horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Local hydrometer data from the type location and from pedons in Camp and Wood Counties are in the State Office files. Also, organic carbon data is available from Rusk and Nacogdoches Counties (2 pedons.)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
