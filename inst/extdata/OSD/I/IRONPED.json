  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ironped series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in granitic,  granitoid,and gneissic residuum and colluvium. The Ironped soils are on pediments, hills and mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 125 millimeters (5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18.5 degrees C (65 degrees F).",

Cougarbutte soils are on fan aprons over pediments and have a loamy particle size control section. Gravesumit and Silvermine soils are on nearby fan remnants. Gravesumit soils are very deep and have an argillic and a calcic horizon, and a coarse-loamy particle-size control section. Silvermine soils are shallow to a weakly cemented duripan. Hexie soils are on mountain backslopes and are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. They have a coarse-loamy argillic horizon above the contact. Lostpalms soils are on steep pediments and have a shallow lithic contact and are skeletal with greater than 35 percent rock fragments. Pinecity soils are on pediments, hills or mountains, but are typically on north-facing slopes and/or at higher elevations with a cooler soil temperature regime."
