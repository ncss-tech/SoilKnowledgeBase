  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in granitic, granitoid and gneissic residuum and colluvium. Elevations range from 700 to 1,440 meters (2,300 to 4,700 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 175 millimeters (3 to 7 inches, mean annual air temperature is 17 to 20 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 270 to 320 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cougarbutte, Gravesumit, Hexie, Lostpalms, Pinecity, and Silvermine soils. Cougarbutte soils are on fan aprons over pediments and have a loamy particle size control section. Gravesumit and Silvermine soils are on nearby fan remnants. Gravesumit soils are very deep and have an argillic and a calcic horizon, and a coarse-loamy particle-size control section. Silvermine soils are shallow to a weakly cemented duripan. Hexie soils are on mountain backslopes and are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. They have a coarse-loamy argillic horizon above the contact. Lostpalms soils are on steep pediments and have a shallow lithic contact and are skeletal with greater than 35 percent rock fragments. Pinecity soils are on pediments, hills or mountains, but are typically on north-facing slopes and/or at higher elevations with a cooler soil temperature regime."
