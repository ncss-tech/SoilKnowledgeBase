    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to the duripan is 3 to 12 inches.  The duripan is 20 inches thick or more.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 65 degrees F., mineralogy is mixed and the soil above the duripan is dry for 60 consecutive days or more in most years.  The A horizon colors are in 7.5YR and 5YR hues and have values of 4, 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  Chromas are 4 to 8 dry and 2, 3 or 4 moist.  Texture ranges from loam to gravelly or cobbly loam, gravelly clay loam and very fine sandy loam; structure from massive to moderate granular; consistence is soft to slightly hard, and reaction from strongly acid to slightly acid.  The Bt horizon colors are in 5YR and 7.5YR hues with values of 4, 5 and 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  Chromas are 4 to 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  Texture ranges from heavy loam to light clay loam that usually is gravelly.  Structure is similar to the A horizon structure; consistence is slightly hard or hard; and reaction is strongly acid to neutral."

Elevations are 195 to 1,000 feet.  The climate is sub-humid mesothermal with mean annual rainfall of 23 to 40 inches, with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F. average January temperature about 45 degrees F., and average July temperature about 82 degrees F."

Last revised by state on 9/66.\n5/2005 Competing section updated. - SS\n3/2003 Edits to cover use in Butte County.  Expanded the following ranges in the A horizon: values of 6 dry; 4 moist, add clay loam, moderately acid to slightly acid.  In the Bt horizon: slightly acid to neutral, clay up to 35.  Expanded elevation from 400 to 195 feet and rainfall from 25 to 23 inches.  Change drainage class from well to somewhat poorly.  Did not review competing series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
