McMullin  soils are not influenced by amorphous material  and are shallow to a lithic contact with shale, sandstone, basic igneous or metamorphic rocks. Reston soils are dry in the soil moisture control section for 60 to 90 days and are very shallow to indurated metavolcanic rocks (greenstone). Skyridge  soils have subangular sandstone fragments throughout the profile. Whisk soils are dry in the soil moisture control section for 60 to 90 days following the summer solstice  and are shallow to unweathered granodiorite."

They formed in residuum from volcanic breccia. The climate has cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. Annual precipitation ranges from 985 to 1600 mm (35 to 70 in) . Mean annual air temperature is 13 degrees C (52 degrees F). Average January temperature is 6 degrees C (35 degrees F), average July temperature is about 23 degrees C (70 degrees F). Frost-free season is about 190 to 260 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:\nParticle size control section recognized in this pedon: 0 to 23 cm\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 23 cm\nLithic contact: 23 cm\nIron  Mountain soils were formerly classified as medial, mesic Lithic Mollic Vitrandepts. An examination of the available lab. data shows that the 15 bar water to clay ratio is not high enough to qualify for being dominated by amorphous material. Hence not medial. Also, bulk densities are not generally any lower than about 1.0 g/cc. Evidence doesn't substantiate having greater than 60 percent vitric material .\nSeries was updated to 12th edition taxonomy (Lithic Ultic Haploxerolls subgroup, previously Lithic Haploxerolls) to reflect the base saturation range historically provided (50 to 75 percent) and the laboratory data available from MLRA 22A . The soils should be reviewed across the 3 MLRAs to explore likely series criteria differences. 11/18\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNASIS User Pedon ID: 54-CA-52-003\nNASIS User Pedon IDs with supporting laboratory data in MLRA 22A:\n65-CA-05-004x\n67-CA-05-036x\nThe soil was classified using the 12th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
