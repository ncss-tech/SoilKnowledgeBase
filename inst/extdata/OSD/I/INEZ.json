  "OVERVIEW": "The Inez series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium of late Pleistocene age. These nearly level soils are on stream terraces on flat coastal plains.  Slopes are typically less than 1 percent but range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).",
