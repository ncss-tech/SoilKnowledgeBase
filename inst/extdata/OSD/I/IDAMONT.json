  "OVERVIEW": "The Idamont series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains and foothills.  They formed in glacial till with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and moderately rapid below.  Slope ranges from 5 to 65 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is about 35 inches.",
