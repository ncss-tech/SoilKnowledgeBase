  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The series control section is dominated by fine sand and has 85 percent or more passing the No. 40 sieve.  It also has no rock fragments.  Some pedons have an O horizon as much as 6 inches thick.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 18 inches in thickness where texture is loamy fine sand or coarser and 7 to 18 inches in thickness for those soils with finer textures.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral.  Some pedons have an AB or BA horizon as much as 6 inches thick.  The A horizon is loamy fine sand, fine sand, sand, loamy sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  It ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bg horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 4 or 5.  In some pedons it has discontinuous nearly horizontal remnants as well as involutions of the A horizon 0.5 to 10 cm thick that presumably resulted from frost action. It is fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  It ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. Reaction is moderately acid to mildly alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The Isanti soils formed in gravel free, noncalcareous sandy glacial outwash or eolian sediments of Late Wisconsinan Age.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 37 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 22 to 33 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 150.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 700 to 1600 feet."
