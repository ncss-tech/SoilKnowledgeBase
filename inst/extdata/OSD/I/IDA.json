  "STATES": "IA,MO,NE",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ida series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in calcareous loess. These soils are on side slopes and crests on dissected till plains and on risers on stream terraces. Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 74 centimeters (29 inches).",
