  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum and the depth to hard rock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Boulders and stones occupy from 1 to 50 percent of the surface.\nRock fragment content ranges from 15 to 65 percent in the A and E horizons; 0 to 5 percent stones, 0 to 20 percent cobbles, and 5 to 65 percent gravel. Rock fragment content by volume in the Bt and BC horizons range from 35 to 80 percent; 0 to 40 percent stones, 10 to 30 percent cobbles, and 10 to 35 percent gravel. Approximately 65 percent of the gravel ranges between 3 inches and 1/4 inch in size. The mean annual soil temperature is 55 to 59 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 3 or 4 (5 or 6 dry) and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hues, values of 4 to 6 and chromas of 3 to 6. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid, unless limed.\nThe Bt1 horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6 and is very strongly acid or strongly acid. The Bt2 horizon has 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5YR hue; value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 3 to 6. The Bt horizon is very cobbly, very gravelly, or very stony analogues of silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam. It is extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, rarely 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 8. High chroma mottles and some 2 chroma mottles are present. Hue and value of the mottlesare similar to those of the matrix. It is very cobbly, or very gravelly analogues of silt loam, loam, or clay loam."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Blackthorn, Croom, Elliber, Gainesboro, Hartleton, Macove, Mertz, Pattenburg, Trevlac and Weverton series. Blackthorn, Macove, and Weaverton soils are deeper than 60 inches to hard bedrock. Croom soils have gravelly, very fine, sandy clay loam Bt horizons and very gravelly loamy sand B3 horizons and are deeper than 60 inches to hard bedrock. Elliber soils have solums that range from 40 to 80 inches and the depth to the bedrock is greater than 42 inches. Gainesboro soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock and are formed in residuum from sedimentary rocks. Hartleton soils have formed in channery glacial till and the depth to the sandstone or shale bedrock is greater than 40 inches. Mertz soils have formed in cherty colluvium or glacial material from limestone containing varying amounts of chert and the solum thickness and depth to bedrock is greater than 40 inches. The depth to bedrock is greater than 42 inches for Pattenburg soils and the regolith has weathered from reddish quartzose conglomerate. Trevlac soils formed in residuum from interbeddedsiltstone, sandstone, and shale and have a paralithic contact within depths of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Irondale soils are on steep mountainous slopes at elevations between 1,000 and 1,700 feet. Slopes are commonly 20 to 35 percent but have an extreme range from 3 to 45 percent. The soils formed in silty material and loamy residuum from igneous rocks and possibly thin loess deposits. Stoniness is a common feature of the series with occasional boulders and numerous cobble and gravel-size rock fragments. The parent rock is composed mostly of rhyolites and felsites. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 55 to 58 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Frenchmill, Killarney, Knobtop and Loughboro soils. Frenchmill soils are very deep and are below Irondale soils in the landscape. Killarney soils are on lower slopes and have a fragipan. Knobtop soils occupy the gentle to sloping mountain ridges and tops and contain less than 15 percent coarse fragments. Loughboro soils are on nearly level areas at the base of the mountains. They are deep, poorly drained soils and contain only a trace of coarse fragments."
