The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is less than 9 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is usually moist in all parts from mid-November to mid-June.  It is dry in some or all parts the rest of the time but is not dry in all parts for 45 consecutive days.  The particle-size control section averages less than 35 percent clay.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid with pH increasing with increasing depth.  Base saturation ranges from 35 to 50 percent throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/1, 4/2 or 3/2 and moist color of 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1 or 3/2.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3 or 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 4/2, 5/2, 5/3, 2/2 or 4/4.  It is clay loam or heavy clay loam.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 7/3, 7/4 or 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 6/3, 6/4 or 5/4.  It is loam or sandy loam and is massive or has weak subangular blocky structure.  It contains about 5 to 20 percent mica and the soil has a smooth or \"greasy\" feel due to the mica."
