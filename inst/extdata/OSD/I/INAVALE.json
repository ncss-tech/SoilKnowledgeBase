Revised Geographically Associated Soils section.\n01/2008 RRH: Areas of Inavale soils having aquic conditions from 100 to 183 centimeters need to be recorrelated or remapped to the Calamus or Inglewood series depending on whether in the ustic or udic moisture regime.\n01/2008 RRH: Areas of Inavale soils mapped in the aridic-ustic and udic moisture regimes need to be recorrelated. Inavale soils mapped in the typic-ustic and udic-ustic moisture regimes can remain Inavale because the flooding may be more significant than the adjacent moisture regime differences.\n01/2008 RRH: metric conversion; Range in Characteristics: revised; Geographic Setting: revised; Geographically Associated Soils: revised to fit soils at type location, many different catena of soils exist throughout its extent; Use and Vegetation: revised; Distribution and Extent: revised; Additional Data: added\n7/2011 JGA: Added soil temperature regime, mean annual soil temperature, particle size clay and sand to the RIC.  Increased mean annual precipitation to 760 mm from 710 mm based on climate data. Updated geographically associated soils and added keys to soil taxonomy edition. Changed precipitation values from centimeters to millimeters. Removed silt loam from surface texture, since it is not used in any surface texture in map units.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data is available from the National Soil Survey Center, Soil Survey Laboratory for Pedon IDs, 80NE061001, 04NE153001, and 04NE053003. Pedon ID 1974NE181010-OSD represents the Typical Pedon and is in NASIS. Kansas State University Laboratory, Manhattan, KS pedon 09KS1571050.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
