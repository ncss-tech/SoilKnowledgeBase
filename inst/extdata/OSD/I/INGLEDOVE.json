Rounded gravel and cobbles range from 0 to 35 percent in the A, Ap, and upper Bt horizons and from 0 to 60 percent in the lower Bt and C horizons. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through neutral in the A, Ap, and upper Bt horizons and from moderately acid through neutral in the lower Bt and C horizons.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8. It is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8. It is loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 45 inches."

Alonzville and Coursey soils have lower base saturations and are on similar landscapes. Berks, Lehew, and Weikert soils are shallower to bedrock, contain more rock fragments in the subsoil, and are on uplands. Broadway, Clubcaf, Gladehill, Gullion, Newmarc, Nomberville, and Wolfgap soils have mollic epipedons and are on flood plains. Derroc soils contain more rock fragments in the subsoil and are on flood plains. Frederick and Groseclose soils contain more clay in the subsoil and are on uplands. Moomaw soils have fragipans and are on similar landscapes. Shottower soils contain more clay in the subsoil and are on similar landscapes."
