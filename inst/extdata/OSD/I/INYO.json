Thermic temperature regime -- mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.\n3.  Mineralogy -- assumed mixed.\n4.  Particle size class -- sandy - based on field estimates.\n5.  Moisture regime - aridic bordering on xeric.\n5.1 The moisture control section is dry throughout from April 30 to November 30.  It is moist throughout from December 1 to February 1.  Runoff from higher grounds increases the number of days the moisture control section is moist in some or all parts.\n5.2 The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from February 1 to January 1 (335 days).  Within this time period, the MCS is dry from April 30 to November 30 (210 days).\n5.3 The soil temperature exceeds 47 degrees F from March 1 to December 15 (270 days).  Within this time period the moisture control section is dry from April 30 to November 30.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
