  "OVERVIEW": "The Inyo series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in mixed alluvium and windblown deposits.  Inyo soils are on alluvial fans, fan terraces, and stabilized dunes on stream terraces, and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 130 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C.",

Thermic temperature regime -- mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.\n3.  Mineralogy -- assumed mixed.\n4.  Particle size class -- sandy - based on field estimates.\n5.  Moisture regime - aridic bordering on xeric.\n5.1 The moisture control section is dry throughout from April 30 to November 30.  It is moist throughout from December 1 to February 1.  Runoff from higher grounds increases the number of days the moisture control section is moist in some or all parts.\n5.2 The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from February 1 to January 1 (335 days).  Within this time period, the MCS is dry from April 30 to November 30 (210 days).\n5.3 The soil temperature exceeds 47 degrees F from March 1 to December 15 (270 days).  Within this time period the moisture control section is dry from April 30 to November 30."
