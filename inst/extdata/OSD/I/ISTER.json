  "OVERVIEW": "The Ister series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum derived mainly from andesite, basalt or rhyolite.  Ister soils are on mountain and hill side slopes.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
