  "REVDATE": "02/2000",
  "STATES": "OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Idabel series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapid permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Recent age.  These nearly level soils are on smooth, wide flood plains of major rivers in the Western Coastal Plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 45 inches, and mean annual temperature is 62 degrees.",

Soils in similar families are the Coushatta, Dela, Madill, Ochlockonee, Oklared, Robinsonville, Severn, Thenas, and Toccoa series.  Coushatta soils have fine-silty control sections.  Dela, Madill, Ochlockonee, Oklared, Robinsonville, Severn, and Toccoa soils do not have cambic horizons.  In addition, Dela and Ochlockonee soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Thenas soils have mottles of chroma 2 or less within a depth of 24 inches."

They formed in loamy, calcareous alluvium of Recent age.  Flooding is rare or occasional for very brief periods.  The climate is humid.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 59 degrees to 65 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 64 to 80."
