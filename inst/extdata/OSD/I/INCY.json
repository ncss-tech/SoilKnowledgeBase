Grandora soils have Bt horizons with clay films. Hotsprings soils average 20 to 35 percent fine pebbles in the particle-size control section.  Lachim, Painter, and Rinquin soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Quincy soils are calcareous in some part, formed in parent material derived from basalt, and have dark basaltic mineral grains.  Quinton and Walco soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Toll soils formed in alluvium and have mainly loamy sand in the particle-size control section.  Winchester soils average more than 75 percent very coarse sand through medium sand which are dark basaltic mineral grains.  Zorravista soils are calcareous throughout and have significant content of volcanic glass."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Incy soils are on semi-stabilized dunes superimposed on basin floor remnants, alluvial fans, and hills.  Local relief is often ridged and hummocky.  These soils formed in eolian sands derived mainly from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,250 to 1,707 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 60 to 130 days."

The present vegetation is mainly antelope bitterbrush, Anderson's peachbrush, Wyoming big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.
