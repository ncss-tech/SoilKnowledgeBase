  "OVERVIEW": "The Infernocone series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and cinders. Infernocone soils are on north-facing slopes and toe slopes of cinder cones. Permeability is rapid.  Slopes are 2 to 40 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
