  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 36 to 60 inches.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 3 to 7 feet.  Rock fragments are pebbles, cobbles, and stones and range from 10 to 35 percent by volume in the solum and from 30 to 70 percent in the C horizon.  Common or many distinct or prominant mottles are above the fragipan.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 52 degrees F.\nThe Ap horizon ranges from very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) to brown (7.5YR 5/2).  It is fine sandy loam or loam and has weak or moderate granular structure.  It is very strongly acid to\nneutral depending upon liming.\nThe B2 horizon ranges from yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) to reddish brown (5YR 4/3), inclusive.  It is unmottled or has only faint mottles above a depth of 12 inches.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam with less than 55 percent silty plus very fine sand.  It is structureless or it has very weak granular or subangular blocky structure.  The horizon is friable or very friable, and it is strongly or medium acid.  The A`2 horizon is lighter in color than the B2 horizon and is distinctly or prominantly mottled. It is typically slightly coarser in texture and is less friable than the B2 horizon.\nThe Bx horizons range from grayish brown (10YR 5/2) to reddish brown (5YR 4/4) and have distinct mottles in ped interiors. They are fine sandy loam or loam.  They have very coarse prismatic structure with or without platy structure in the upper part and are massive or have platy structure in the lower part. They are very firm and brittle, and are medium acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has ranges similar to the Bx horizon in color and texture and is firm or very firm.  It has platy structure or it is massive.  It is slghtly acid to mildly alkaline at the base of the Bx horizon."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bath, Braceville, Broadalbin, Compton, Lackawanna, Ludlow, Mardin, Montauk, Nantucket, Sodus, Swartswood, Wellsboro, Wethersfield and Wurtsboro series.  The Bombay, Langford, Marilla and Mosherville series are smiliar soils in related families.  Bath, Lackawanna, Mardin, and Wellsboro soils commonly have 55 percent or more silt plus very fine sand in particle size control section.  Braceville soils have stratified sand and gravel in the lower part of the\nseries control section.  Broadalbin soils have coarse fragments dominated by granite and gneiss with a significant component of soft dark shale.  Compton soils have lithochromic chroma of 1 or\n2 throughout the soil.  Ludlow, Montauk and Wethersfield soils have sola less than 36 inches thick and lack clay films in the fragipan.  Nantucket soils have fragipans that are strongly acid\nand are clay loam or silty clay loam in the lower part.  Sodus soils have few or no mottles above the fragipan.  Swartswood and Wurtsboro soils are strongly or very strongly acid in the\nfragipan.  Bombay soils lack a fragipan.  Langford soils have an argillic horizon.  Marilla soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section.  Mosherville soils have distinct mottles within\n12 inches of the soil surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ira soils are nearly level to moderately steep soils on drumloidal land forms and nearly level to sloping soils areas on till plains.  Slope gradients range from 1 to 20 percent.  The soils developed in firm, mildly to moderately calcareous loamy glacial till dominated by red or gray sandstone with variable components of limestone and shale.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 45 inches; mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 degrees to 49 degrees F.; and mean growing season ranges from 120 to 180 days."

Scriba, somewhat poorly drained soils, Sodus, well drained soils and Sun, very poorly to poorly drained soils, are catenary associates."
