These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary formations high in gypsum and calcium carbonate.  Elevations range from 4800 to 6000 feet.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 57 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  The frost-free period is 150 to 165 days."
