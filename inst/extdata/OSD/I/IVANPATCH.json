  "OVERVIEW": "The Ivanpatch series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from sedimentary formations high in gypsum and calcium carbonate.  Ivanpatch soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
