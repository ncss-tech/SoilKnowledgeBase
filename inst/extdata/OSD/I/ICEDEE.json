This layer is classified as in the loamy particle-size family. Because the 2Eb horizon is 13 cm thick or more, the soil classifies as ashy over loamy. The clayey 2Bt horizon is separated from the ashy part by more than 13 cm. The loamy part is not strongly contrasting to the clayey part; therefore, the soil does not classify as aniso. Base saturation is inferred from laboratory data for the Btree series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
