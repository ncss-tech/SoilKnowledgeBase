  "OVERVIEW": "The Ipson series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from basic and intermediate igneous rocks. Ipson soils occur on mountain slopes and alluvial fans and have slopes of 1 to 50 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 305 mm (12 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F",
