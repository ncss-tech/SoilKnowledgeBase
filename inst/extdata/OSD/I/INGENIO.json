  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 27 to 48 inches.  Thickness of the argillic horizon varies from 22 to 38 inches.  Quartz grains range from common to many in the whole profile.  Reaction is strongly or very strongly acid in the whole profile.  Cation exchange capacity (by NH4OAC) in the argillic horizon varies from 7.8 to 9.3 meq/100 grams of clay.  Organic content in the upper 6 inches of the argillic horizon varies from 0.6 to 0.8 percent.  Base saturation (by sum of cations) ranges from 19 to 25 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 76 to 78 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hues of 10YR to 5YR, values of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  High chroma mottles may or may not be present.  Texture is clay loam or silty clay loam.  Structure is weak fine or medium subangular blocky to moderate fine and medium granular.\nThe Bt horizons have hues of 2.5YR or 5YR, values of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is clay or silty clay in the upper part and silty clay or silty clay loam in the lower part.  Structure is weak or moderate fine to coarse subangular blocky.  Consistence is slightly sticky and plastic throughout.  Clay films range from very few to many.\nThe BC horizon, where present, is silty clay or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizons are mostly saprolite with variegated colors.  Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam or loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other known series in the same family.  The Aibonito, Alonso, Consejo, Consumo, Corozal, Corozo, Daguey, Lirios, Jagueyes, Magens, Maricao, Moca, Patillas and Rio Piedias series are similar soils in related families.  The Aibonito, Alonso and Daguey soils have higher organic matter content in the upper argillic horizon.  The Consejo, Consumo, Corozal, Lirios, Maricao, Moca, Patillas and Rio Piedias soils all have higher CEC, more than 24 meq/100 grams of clay in the argillic horizon.  The Corozo soils have sandy surface layers.  The Jagueyes soils have coarser textured profiles dominantly sandy clay loam.  The Magens soils have ustic moisture regimes."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Ingenio soils are moderately steep to steep soils on side slopes and narrow ridge tops with slope gradients of 5 to 40 percent.  The regolith consists of medium and fine textured, highly weathered residuum of plutonic ingneous rocks, mainly granodiorite and quartz diorite.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 75 to 85 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 77 to 80 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Lirios and Jagueyes series and the Limones, Pandura, Pellejas, and Tejas series.  The Lirios soils occupy steeper slopes, are shallower to the saprolite and have thinner argillic horizons.  The Jagueyes soils occupy similar positions but have coarser textured profiles.  The Limones soils occupy similar positions but have upper argillic horizons higher in organic matter.  The Padura, Pellejas, and Tejas soils are shallower to the granitic rocks."
