The somewhat excessively drained Lincoln soils have contrasting textures at a depth greater than 40 inches (102 centimeters) and are lower on the flood plains.  Saxman soils are moderately well drained, on high flood plains and have sandy textures throughout the profile.  Willowbrook and Yaggy soils are on floodplains and have sandy textures throughout the profile."
