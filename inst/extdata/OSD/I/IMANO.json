  "OVERVIEW": "The Imano series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly over rapidly permeable soils. They are formed in loamy sediments moderately deep over sandy alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains in the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79).  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 57 degrees F (14 degrees C), and mean annual precipitation is 24 inches (61 centimeters).",

The somewhat excessively drained Lincoln soils have contrasting textures at a depth greater than 40 inches (102 centimeters) and are lower on the flood plains.  Saxman soils are moderately well drained, on high flood plains and have sandy textures throughout the profile.  Willowbrook and Yaggy soils are on floodplains and have sandy textures throughout the profile."
