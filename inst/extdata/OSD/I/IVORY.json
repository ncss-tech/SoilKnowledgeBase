  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 50 inches.  Depth to rippable bedrock, typically shale and siltstone, ranges from 60 to 100 inches.  Rock fragments, mainly channers, flagstones and gravel, range from 5 to 30 percent by volume in the solum, and from 15 to 60 percent in the substratum.  Reaction ranges from very strongly to moderately acid throughout the soil.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  The BEg horizon is similar to the BE horizon except value is 6 or 7 and chroma is 1 or 2. Texture of both horizons is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 6, with both high and low chroma redoximorphic features.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay in the fine-earth fraction.  Structure is prismatic or weak to strong angular or subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable or firm. Some pedons have a BC horizon with colors and textures similar to the Bt horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y or 5GY, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Color is commonly variegated and relates to the color of the weathering bedrock. Texture is similar to the B horizon.  The C horizon has prismatic or platy structure, or it is massive.\nThe Cr horizon, when present, has color similar to the C horizon.  It is saprolite that crushes to silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  Consistence is firm or very firm.\nThe R horizon is shale, siltstone or fine grained sandstone bedrock that can be interbedded."

The Cavode series is the mesic equivalent of Ivory. Blairton soils are moderately deep to bedrock and are mesic. Dolph soils formed in loess underlain with clayey residuum. Frewsburg soils have a fine loamy particle size control section and are moderately deep to bedrock.  Hornell and Kanona soils formed in glacial till and have mesic temperature regimes.  Muskellunge soils formed in glacio-lacustrine deposits and do not have rock fragments."

Mean annual air temperatures range from 40 to 45 degrees F., annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches; and the growing season ranges from 90 to 120 days.

In addition Gilpin soils are moderately deep.  The Carrollton and Frewsburg soils are on associated bedrock controlled landscapes and have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches. Onoville soils are nearby on better drained landscapes and are fine-loamy."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil was previously classified as an Alfisol, It has low base saturation (less than 35%).  Amendments to Soil Taxonomy now allow frigid Ultisols.  This series is reclassified as a fine, mixed, subactive, frigid Aeric Endoaquults.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 15 inches (Ap,BE and BEg horizons).\nb. Argillic horizon - the zone from 15 to 35 inches (Bt horizon).\nc. Aquic moisture regime - endosaturation, evidenced by redoximorphic features in the horizon below the Ap horizon, and ped faces with 2 chroma or less in the argillic horizon (Bt horizon).\nd. Aeric subgroup - evidenced by more than 40 percent high chroma matrix in the zone from 5 to 12 inches (BE horizon)."
