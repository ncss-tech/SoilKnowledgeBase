  "OVERVIEW": "The Isbell series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from calcareous sandstone and shale. These soils are on mountain slopes, alluvial fans and stream terraces. The mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
