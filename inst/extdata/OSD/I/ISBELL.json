  "OVERVIEW": "The Isbell series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from calcareous sandstone and shale. These soils are on mountain slopes, alluvial fans and stream terraces. The mean annual precipitation iu about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and extends into the B2t horizon in most pedons. The combined thickness of the Al and B2t horizons is 25 to 50 inches. Weathered sandstone or shale bedrock occurs at depths of 40 to more than 60 inches. The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 41 to 45 F.  The mean summer temperature ranges from 60 to 68 F. The soils are usually moist but are dry for 50 to 85 consecutive days during the late summer.\nThe Al horizon has dominant hue of 10YR, but ranges from 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3 dry and moist. It contains 0 to 20 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  This horizon is slightly acid or neutral, and 8 to 19 inches thick.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist. It ranges from clay loam or silty clay loam to sandy clay loam with 0 to 20 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles. This horizon has few to continuous thin, and few moderately thick clay films on faces of peds.  It is dominantly noncalcareous but is slightly calcareous in the lower part of some pedons, and is slightly acid through neutral. It ranges from 16 to 36 inches thick.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y. Most pedons have hue of 2.5Y or SY in some parts. It has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4 dry, 2 through 6 moist. It ranges generally from loam or silty clay loam, to silty clay. A gravelly substratum phase mapped has a very cobbly loam or gravelly sandy loam below depths of 40 inches. The C horizon has 0 to 30 percent cobbles and 0 to 40 percent pebbles. It is noncalcareous to moderately calcareous and is slightly acid to strongly alkaline."

Crume soils have 3 to 30 percent pumice ash in the solum, have diatomite or tuff-like bedrock deeper than 40 inches, lack hue yellower than 10YR in any part, and are noncalcareous throughout.  Kanlee soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Maple Mountain soils have 20 to 35 percent rock fragments in the B2t horizon.  Molyneux soils have 16 to 25 inches of solum and occur in a 12 to 16 inch precipitation zone. Sewell soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock."

These soils formed in residuum and alluvium weathered from calcareous sandstone and shale. The climate is moist subhumid, and the average annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 25 inches. The mean annual temperature is 30 to 45 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F., and the frost-free period ranges from 65 to 80 days."
