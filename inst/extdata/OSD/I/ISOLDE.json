Ecklund soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Hawsley soils have a Ck horizon within 100 cm and have a stratified particle-size control section dominated by sand with strata of fine sand or coarse sand.  Kawich soils are strongly effervescent or violently effervescent and are strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.  Razito soils are calcareous throughout and are intermittently moist from July to September.  Sheppard soils have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR and are intermittently moist from July to September.  Stumble soils have B horizons, average loamy sand in the particle-size control section, and have gravelly strata within 100 cm.  Sundown soils are calcareous throughout, are stratified, contain gravel, and average loamy fine sand in the particle-size control section.  Tipper soils have bedrock at a depth of 50 to 100 cm.  Tipperary soils are calcareous to within 25 cm of the surface, are moist in the spring and early summer, and have a mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 12 degrees C.  Tricera soils are noncalcareous to a depth of 100 cm and have soil temperature of 8 to 12 degrees C.  Yenrab soils have sodium adsorption ratios of greater than 13."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Isolde soils are on dunes.  The dunes are semi-stabilized by vegetation and are superimposed over various other landforms of intermontane basin landscapes.  These soils formed in eolian sand derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,158 to 1,786 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 180 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."
