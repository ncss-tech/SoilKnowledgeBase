  "OVERVIEW": "The Izee series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from shale, sandstone, limestone, and conglomerate with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  These soils are north facing slopes in uplands.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
