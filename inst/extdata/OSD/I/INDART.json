  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is noncalcareous and slightly to moderately acid throughout. Thickness of solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches and depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Organic carbon ranges from .6 to about 2 percent in the surface horizons and decreases uniformly with depth. The soil is 80 to 100 percent base saturated. Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent but are typically less than 10 percent. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 degrees to 47 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 40 degrees to 46 degrees F. with an O horizon at least 4 inches thick and in areas with a good crown cover.\nA horizons are absent in some pedons.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is usually platy, but is granular in some pedons. This horizon is soft to slightly hard.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6. It is typically sandy clay loam but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 5 to 30 percent, sand from 40 to 75 percent with more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser. Oriented clay films are present in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Indart soils are on moderately steep to steeply sloping upland hills, ridges, and mountainsides. At the type location these soils are at elevations in excess of 7,500 feet. They formed in parent sediments weathered from underlying reddish brown sandstones and sandy shales. Slopes usually range from 5 to 40 percent. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 20 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months. The mean annual temperature is 36 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 58 degrees F."
