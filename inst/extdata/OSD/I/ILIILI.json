Some pedons have a C horizon of loose fragmental lava. It is medium acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry. It is clay loam or silty clay loam and extremely stony and mucky.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry. It is clay loam or silty clay loam and extremely stony."
