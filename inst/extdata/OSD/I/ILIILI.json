  "STATES": "AS,PB",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Iliili series consists of shallow, well drained soils on uplands. These soils formed in volcanic ash and are underlain by lava. Slope is 3 to 15 percent. Elevation is near sea level to 200 feet. The mean annual rainfall is about 140 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 80 degrees F.",

Some pedons have a C horizon of loose fragmental lava. It is medium acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry. It is clay loam or silty clay loam and extremely stony and mucky.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry. It is clay loam or silty clay loam and extremely stony."
