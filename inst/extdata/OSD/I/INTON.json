  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges in thickness from 30 to greater than 80 inches and lacks free carbonates.  Depth to gray redox depletions typically ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  The Inton soils have a matrix with a hue of 2.5Y or 5Y and chroma of 2 or less within 30 inches of the surface.  Sand content is less than 5 percent in the upper 48 inches.  These soils are moderately acid or strongly acid in the most acid part of the solum.  Thickness of the A horizon, depth to clay maximum, maximum percent clay, thickness of the Bt horizon and depth to gray colors decreases with increasing slope gradient on convex slopes.  Depth to the clay maximum ranges from about 13 to 25 inches, but it may be less in areas of significant erosion.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The A horizon, where present, has 10YR hue, value of 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is 1 to 5 inches thick and is silt loam.\nThe E horizon commonly is present below the A horizon in areas not cultivated.  It has 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is 2 to 8 inches thick and is silt loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The rest of the Bt horizons and the BC horizon have redox depletions and have matrix colors of 2.5Y or 5Y hue, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less.  The Bt horizon averages about 32 to 35 percent clay with a maximum of about 38 percent in any subhorizon.  The BC horizon averages about 27 to 32 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has colors similar to the lower part of the Bt and the BC horizon.\nIn many areas, especially on the lower parts of the landscape 2Ab and 2Btgb horizons are present.  Colors are variable but typically are grayish with redox concentrations present.  Textures are also variable but increases in clay and sand content are evident."

Barony (T), Elco, Grays, Kaneville (T), Libre, Mayville, Somonank (T), Windere, Wingate, and Zurich soils contain more than 5 percent sand in parts of the solum above 48 inches.  Birkbeck, Downsouth (T), Homen (T), Redbud, and Windfield soils have higher chroma in the lower part of the Bt horizons and lack gleyed colors above 36 inches.  Hedrick soils have ochric epipedons that have color value and chroma moist of 3 or less.  Iona soils have a thinner solum and contain carbonates at 40 to 50 inches.  Rocheport soils have lithic or paralithic contact within a depth of 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Inton soils are on short convex to straight sideslopes and coves of drainageways surrounding the nearly level stable upland divides in the loess covered pre-Wisconsin till plain.  The loess is 4 to 8 or more feet thick and is underlain by a gray or grayish, loamy or clayey paleosol.  Slope gradient ranges from 2 to 18 percent.  These soils formed in a deoxidized and leached weathering zone or a thin oxidized and leached zone and the underlying  deoxidized and leached zone with redox depletions and redox concentrations and the underlying paleosol derived from glacial till.  This weathering zone is stratigraphically related to the gray or grayish, loamy or clayey paleosol.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 34 inches.  The annual frost free period ranges from 155 to 180 days.  Elevation ranges from about 650 to 1400 feet above mean sea level."
