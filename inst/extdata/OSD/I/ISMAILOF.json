Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The pH of the solum ranges from 5.1 to 7.3.  The pH of the substratum increases with depth and ranges from 6.6 to 8.4.\nA 1/4 inch thick strata of light gray (10YR 7/2) very fine sandy loam volcanic ash commonly occurs between the O and E horizons.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand with 0 to 14 percent gravel.\nThe Bhs and were present the Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sandy loam, gravelly fine sandy loam, or gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly loamy sand with 0 to 70 percent gravel.\nThe C horizons have variegated colors.  They are very gravelly or extremely gravelly sand.  Rock fragments range from 40 to 70 percent and include 30 to 55 percent gravel and 10 to 20 percent cobble."

In some areas recent tectonic activity has dropped these landforms several feet.  The lowest of these subsided areas are affected by saltwater intrusion.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Elevations are 0 to 20 feet.\nThe climate is maritime with mild winters and cool summers.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 65 to 75 inches and the mean annual snowfall is 50 to 60 inches.  Mean January temperature is 26 degrees F., mean July temperature is 55  degrees F., and the mean annual temperature ranges from 38  to 40 degrees F."
