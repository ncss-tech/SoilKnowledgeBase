The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches, and the average annual temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 80 to 100 days.   Elevation ranges from 4,500 to 5,600 feet."

Joevar, Rexburg, and Ririe soils are well drained and are coarse-silty.  Arbone soils are well drained and are coarse-loamy.  Hondoho soils are well drained and are loamy-skeletal.  Bear Lake and Downata soils are on slightly lower positions on flood plains and stream terraces.  Joevar soils are on slightly higher, better drained positions on stream terraces.  Rexburg and Ririe soils are on loess covered fan terraces above Inkom soils.  Arbone and Hondoho soils are on fan terraces and terrace escarpments adjacent to the Inkom soils."
