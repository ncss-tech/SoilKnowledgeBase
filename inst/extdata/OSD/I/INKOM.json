  "OVERVIEW": "Inkom series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in silty alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Permeability is moderate.  These soils are on stream terraces and flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the average annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
