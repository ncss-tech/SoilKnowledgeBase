  "OVERVIEW": "The Ihlen series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in 20 to 40 inches of loess over bedrock in uplands.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of solum ranges from 20 to 38 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Free carbonates are lacking in pedons that have bedrock at depths of less than 28 inches and typically are in the C horizon where it extends below depths of about 28 inches.  Some of the carbonates are in the form of soft masses.  The solum and the C horizon typically lack coarse fragments but the horizon that overlies the bedrock has up to 10 percent of coarse fragments, mostly quartzite in some pedons.  The A horizon and B horizon is neutral or slightly acid and the BC horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches in thickness.  Between depths of 10 inches and the top of the bedrock the soil averages between 24 and 32 percent clay and less than 5 percent of fine sand and coarser.  The highest content of clay is in the A horizon and the content of clay decreases uniformly with depth.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 through 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2, dry or moist.  It typically is silty clay loam but includes silt loam.  Some pedons have an AB horizon ranging to as much as 6 inches in thickness.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR in the upper part and 10YR or 2.5Y in the lower part, value of 4 through 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  The lower chroma primarily is on faces of peds.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  This horizon ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline."
