  "OVERVIEW": "The Invershiel series consists of moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in moderately thick beds of clayey marine sediments over marl.  These soils are on nearly level Coastal Plain uplands and stream terraces.  The seasonal high water table is within 12 to 30 inches of the surface for 1 to 4 months annually.  Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to soft marl ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A and E horizons, unless limed, medium acid to mildly alkaline in the Bt horizon, and neutral to moderately alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hues of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, values of 3 to 5, and chromas of 2 to 4.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hues of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, values of 4 to 6, and chromas of 4 to 8.  Some pedons are mottled in this upper part with hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The lower part has matrix hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  The lower part is mottled in shades of red, yellow, brown, or gray.  The Bt horizon is sandy clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, or clay, and averages between 35 and 50 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Some pedons have few to common manganese concretions 2 to 25 millimeters in diameter in the lower part.\nThe 2Btg horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8, hue of 5Y, 5GY, or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles are in shades of yellow, brown, or gray.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or clay.  Some pedons have strata of loamy or sandy loam, pockets of marl, or few to many manganese concretions.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown or gray.  A few pedons have few small to large reddish brown concretions.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon is light colored marl.  In some pedons, have strata of loamy clayey sediments, and shells."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Orange series is the only one in the same family.  Orange soils contain more than 30 percent silt in the control section and are underlain by fine grained mafic rocks. Those soils in closely related families are the Archer, Bushnell, Cadeville, and Wister series.  Archer soils lack chroma 2 mottles in the upper 10 inches of the Bt horizon and they have better drainage.  Bushnell soils are hyperthermic.  Cadeville and Wister soils have sola thicker than 40 inches and are not underlain with marl"
