Budlewis and Tanner soils occur on lower terraces and have fine particle-size control sections.  Eep soils occur on hillsides and breaks, are very deep and have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections.  Howcree soils have a clayey-skeletal particle-size control section, while occurring on the same terraces as the Ibola soil."
