  "OVERVIEW": "The Ibola series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils, with moderately slow permeability that formed in mixed alluvium from welded tuff and volcanic ash.  They are on terraces.  Slopes range from 2 to 6 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 360 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",
