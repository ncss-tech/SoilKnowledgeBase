  "OVERVIEW": "The Iva series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess. These soils are on uplands and terraces and have slopes ranging from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (56 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1068 mm (42 inches).",
