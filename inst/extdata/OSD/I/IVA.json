Aptakisic soils have sola less than 102 cm (40 inches) thick. Caseyville soils have less than 7 percent sand throughout the subsoil and substratum and contain more smectitic clay and less illitic clay. Creal soils are 24 inches or more to the top of the argillic horizon. Fitchville soils have bedding plane stratification or lamination within the series control section and have a mean annual soil temperature less than 13.3 degrees C. (56 degrees F). Kendall and Starks soils contain more than 15 percent sand in the lower part of the soil profile. Stronghurst soils have a mean annual soil temperature less than 13.3 degrees C. (56 degrees F.), contain more smectitic clay and less illitic clay and inherently contain more phosphate and potash. Waynetown soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the soil profile. Yeddo soils have carbonates within a depth of 140 cm (55 inches)."

Iva soils formed in 1.5 to more than 4 meters (5 to more than 12 feet) of loess on Illinoian till, or older landscapes overlying till, limestone, sandstone, siltstone, shale or outwash.  The mean annual temperature varies from 12 to 14 degrees C (53 degrees to 57 degrees F) and the mean annual precipitation varies from 1016 to 1143 mm (40 to 45 inches). The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 13.3 to 15 degrees C. (56 to slightly less than 59 degrees F.)."
