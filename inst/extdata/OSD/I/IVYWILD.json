The mean annual temperature is 37 to 43 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 35 to 80 days.  Elevation ranges from 7,600 to 11,500 feet."

    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon: from 1 to 2 inches (A horizon)\nCambic horizon: from 6 to 38 inches (Bw1, Bw2 horizons)\nParalithic contact: at 38 inches (top of Cr layer)\nParticle-size control section: the zone from 11 to 38 inches (part of Bw1, the Bw2 horizon)\nThe moisture regime subclass is not clear. As mapped, this soil seems to range from typic udic through ustic udic. Ustic udic was judged to best represent the typical forest plant community.\nWhen established this series was classified as loamy-skeletal, mixed, Dystric Cryochrepts.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This typical pedon was sampled for the NSSL. Survey area sample number 82CO-041-002.\nThe mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
