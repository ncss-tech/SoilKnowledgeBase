  "OVERVIEW": "The Ivywild series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium, or glacial till derived from granitic and metamorphic rocks.  Ivywild soils are on mountain slopes and ridges and have slopes of 5 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

As mapped, this soil seems to range from typic udic through ustic udic. Ustic udic was judged to best represent the typical forest plant community.\nWhen established this series was classified as loamy-skeletal, mixed, Dystric Cryochrepts."

Survey area sample number 82CO-041-002.\nThe mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010."
