  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the permafrost table ranges from 15 to 20 inches.  Lenses of silty muck may occur in the perennially frozen materials.  Fibrous sedge peat generally makes up about 60 to 70 percent of the peaty materials.  The surface of these soils is commonly characterized by high-centered polygons 20 to 30 feet in diameter.  The troughs between the polygons average 3 to 5 feet across."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Lemeta, Milroy, Salamatof, Saltery, and Staney series.  The Lemeta soils consist of layered sphagnum and sedge peat over permafrost.  The Milroy soils consist of partially decomposed sedge peat with many layers of tidal silt and sand.  The Salamatof soils contain layered moss and sedge peat with no permafrost.  The Saltery soils are made up of fibrous sedge peat with layers of volcanic ash, and with no permafrost.  The Staney soils consist of partially decomposed sedge peat with no permafrost."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Inmachuk soils occupy shallow depressions, backwater portions of floodplains, and the beds of drained thaw lakes in tundra areas.  The slope gradient is generally less than 1 percent.  Many areas contain lakes and ponds.  In most areas the water table is at or near the surface.  Polygons are a characteristic feature, and pingos may occur.  The climate is cold maritime with long, cold winters and short, cool summers.  The average annual precipitation is less than 18 inches, and the average annual air temperature is less than 28 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "PRINCIPAL ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "PRINCIPAL ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Milroy series, and the Kuskokwim and Sinuk series.  The Kuskokwim soils have thick peaty surface mats overlying silty mineral materials with permafrost.  The Sinuk soils are stratified sandy and silty soils on floodplains."
