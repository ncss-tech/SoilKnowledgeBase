  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was formerly included in the Sassafras series. Laboratory data indicate a base saturation (by sum of cations) greater than 35 percent, in cropped areas, and a base saturation of less than 35 percent on wooded areas. The high base status in this soil is thought to be the result of long-time cropping practices (liming). The soil would revert to a lower base saturation if the cropland areas were converted back to woodland.\nDiagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 15 inches (Ap and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 15 to 43 inches (Bt and BC horizons)\nAquic conditions--the zone from 48 inches to a depth of 80 inches is periodically saturated (endosaturation)\nSOIL INTERPRETATION RECORD: MD0146\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nMD0146 INGLESIDE   0- 15   52- 58  190-210  42- 48    10- 100\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nMD0146 NONE          3.5-6.0  APPARENT JAN-MAY  >60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nMD0146  0-10  SL                      0-  0  80-100  5-12   1-  5\nMD0146  0-10  LS                      0-  0  80-100  3- 8 1.5-  2\nMD0146 10-43  SL SCL                  0-  0  80-100  8-25  .5-  2\nMD0146 43-56  LS S LFS                0-  0  60-100  3- 8  .5-  2\nMD0146 56-72  SR FSL SICL             0-  0  90-100 15-30  .5-  2\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
