  "OVERVIEW": "The Iberia series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in alkaline clayey alluvium. They are on backswamp positions flanking natural levees on older deta plains of the Mississippi River. Slope is dominantly less than 0.5 percent but ranges up to 1 percent.",
