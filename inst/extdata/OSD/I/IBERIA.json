Cracks up to 1 inch wide develop to a depth of 20 inches or more during normal years and remain open for about 10 to 30 days.\nThe Ap and A horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam in the Ap horizon, and clay in the A horizon. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bssg horizon has hue of 5Y to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2 in the upper part. Where hue is 2.5Y or 10YR, chroma is 1. The lower part of the Bssg horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral (N/) with value of 4 or 5. Masses of iron accumulation are in shades of brown or yellow and range from few to many. Intersecting slickensides range from few to many. Texture is clay. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline. Some pedons have a Bkssg horizon that is calcareous below 20 inches with up to 5 percent calcium carbonate concretions.\nThe 2Btg horizon, where present has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral (N/) with value of 4 or 5. Masses of iron accumulation are in shades of brown or yellow and range from few to many. Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Iberia soils are on backswamp positions flanking natural levees on the older delta plains of the Mississippi River. Slopes are mainly less than 0.5 percent but range up to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation averages about 60 inches near the type location and is uniformly distributed throughout the year. Mean annual temperature averages about 68 degrees F."
