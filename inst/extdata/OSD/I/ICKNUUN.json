  "OVERVIEW": "The Icknuun series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in organic material interlayered with thin strata of mineral material. Icknuun soils are in depressions on till plains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The organic material ranges in thickness from 52 to 60 inches. Thin layers of mineral soil occur within the control section. Thin layers of volcanic ash and woody fragments may occur throughout. Reaction in the ash or mineral layers is very strongly acid to moderately acid. The pH (0.01M CaCl2) of the organic material is more than 4.5 in all parts of the control section. The water table 1s at or near the surface throughout the year\nThe Oe horizons have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. Values increase when organic material is pressed. Texture is mucky peat. Peat and muck layers are present in some pedons. Thin layers of volcanic ash or mineral soil have textures of silt loam or gravelly silt loam.\nThe Ag or C horizons (where present) have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value of 3 to 8. Texture is silt loam modified by 0 to 25 percent gravel."
