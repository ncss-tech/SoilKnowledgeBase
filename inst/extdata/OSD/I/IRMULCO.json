The soil between the depths of 6 and 17 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to August 15 and is dry in some part from September 1 to October 1 in most years.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/3 or 6/3.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3, 4/3, 4/4 or 7.5YR 3/4.  Gravel content is 0 to 10 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.

The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong coastal marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.

Soil Taxonomy Notice 8 deletes Tropudalfs and reclassifies them as Hapludalfs.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in February of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nMany areas mapped as Irmulco soils were mapped as Josephine soils by the California Soil Vegetation Survey 1947-1950.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL number S80CA-045-008-(1-7).  The Bt1 horizon was sampled as two subhorizons (6 to 15 inches and 15 to 26 inches).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
