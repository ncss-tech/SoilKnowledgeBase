The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 3 to 6 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 6 and 17 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to August 15 and is dry in some part from September 1 to October 1 in most years.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/3 or 6/3.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3, 4/3, 4/4 or 7.5YR 3/4.  Gravel content is 0 to 10 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.  Thickness for a mollic epipedon is not met.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4, 7/4; 7.5YR 6/4, 6/6 or 7/4.

Textures with more than 35 percent clay occur below 30 inches.  Gravel content is 0 to 25 percent.  Reaction is very strongly through moderately acid.  Base saturation (sum) is 30 to 60 percent and is greater than 35 percent in the lower part of the argillic horizon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Irmulco soils occur on mountains.  Slopes are 9 to 75 percent.  Elevation is 10 to 800 feet.  The soils formed in material weathered from sandstone.  The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong coastal marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 70 inches.  Mean January temperature is 50 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 55 degrees F.; and mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 290 to 365 days."

Soil Taxonomy Notice 8 deletes Tropudalfs and reclassifies them as Hapludalfs.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in February of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nMany areas mapped as Irmulco soils were mapped as Josephine soils by the California Soil Vegetation Survey 1947-1950.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL number S80CA-045-008-(1-7).  The Bt1 horizon was sampled as two subhorizons (6 to 15 inches and 15 to 26 inches).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
