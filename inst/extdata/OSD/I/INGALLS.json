    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 18 to 40 inches.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 18 to greater than 60 inches.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the pedon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, or is neutral; value of 2 to 4; and chroma of 0 to 3.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. pedons have an Ap horizon up to 7 inches thick with similar colors.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sad, or loamy sand. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3 or hue of 10YR, and value and chroma of 2. It is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nWhere there is no Bhs horizon the Bs1 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 3 or 4. Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bs2 horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. Reaction of the Bs2 horizon ranges from strongly acid to neutral.  Chunks or tongues of ortstein up to 4 inches in diameter are in some pedons but seldom comprise more than 10 to 15 percent of the B horizons. The Bs horizons are sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a C horizon that has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sad. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It includes strata of silt, silt loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, very fine sand, loamy very fine sand, or loamy fine sand, with occasional strata of fine sand, sand, silty clay loam, clay, or silty clay in some pedons.  Thickness of individual strata ranges from less than 1 inch to 18 inches. reaction of the 2C horizon ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline."

These soils formed in 20 to 40 inches of sandy outwash deposits overlying sandy, loamy, and clayey lacustrine deposits.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 41 to 47 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 27 to 33 inches."
