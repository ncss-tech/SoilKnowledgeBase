The soil moisture control section is usually dry and is dry in all parts for 120 to 150 days (cumulative) following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F.  The profile contains 10 to 30 percent volcanic glass and glass-coated aggregates.  Depth to carbonates and the hard brittle layer is 30 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.  Base saturation is 80 to 100 percent.  The particle-size control section is silt loam and averages 18 to 22 percent clay and 65 to 75 percent silt and very fine sand.\nThe A horizon hue of 10YR, value of 5 dry and 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 dry and 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.
