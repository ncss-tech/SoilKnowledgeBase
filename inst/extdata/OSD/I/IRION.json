  "OVERVIEW": "The Irion series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in clayey alluvium derived from limestone over fractured limestone bedrock of the Buda Formation of Cretaceous age. These nearly level soils occur in shallow depressions.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm (22 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (64 degrees F).",
