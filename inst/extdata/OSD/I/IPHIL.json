Cedarhill and Hondoho soils are located in draws and have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections. Rexburg, Ririe, and Kucera soils are found on similar landscapes as Iphil but are on linear to concave slopes; these soils are not calcareous in all parts of all horizons above the calcic horizon after the upper 18 cm of soil has been mixed. Watercanyon soils are also in similar landscape positions as Iphil but on more strongly convex south and west facing positions. Watercanyon soils have an ochric epipedon."
