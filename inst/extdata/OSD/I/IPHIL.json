  "OVERVIEW": "The Iphil series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in loess and silty alluvium derived from loess. Iphil soils formed on hills on terraces and fan remnants and have slopes of 1 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 6.6 degrees C.",

Watercanyon soils are also in similar landscape positions as Iphil but on more strongly convex south and west facing positions. Watercanyon soils have an ochric epipedon."
