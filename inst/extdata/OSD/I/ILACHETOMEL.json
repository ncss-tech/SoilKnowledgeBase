  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ilachetomel soils are in the intertidal zone of mangrove swamps, salt marshes, and tidal marshes adjacent to volcanic islands. Slope is 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in organic deposits derived predominantly from decomposing mangrove roots and litter.  Elevation is -1 to 4 meters (3.3 to 13.1 feet.) The soils are flooded semi-diurnally with ocean salt water during periods of high tide; 30 centimeters above (12 inches) to 30 centimeters (12 inches) below the surface. Areas closer to the lagoon are submerged longer than areas closer to land. The climate is tropical and moist. Because of the strong marine influence, the diurnal and annual range of temperature is limited. Rainfall averages about 3685 millimeters (145 inches) per year and ranges from approximately 2900 to 4400 mm (114 to 173 in.) The seasonal wet (May to November) and dry seasons (December to April) with the driest months (February, March, and April) averaging 178 to 229 milliliters (7 to 9 inches) per month. Rainfall is derived from convective uplift, which results in short duration rainstorms of high intensity. Rainfall is irregularly distributed geographically. These soils lie within the latitudinal zone that receives more solar radiation than it re-radiates back to space. This imbalance maintains the atmospheric temperatures in a quasi-steady state. The mean daily temperature throughout the year averages 27 C (81 F) with a mean diurnal range of about 4 C (7 F.) Relative humidity averages about 90 percent at night and 75 to 80 percent during the day."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chia, Dechel, Mesei, Ngersuul, and Naniak series. The Chia soils are organic to 75 centimeters (30 inches) and over coralline sand. Dechel soils are very poorly drained and are stratified. Ilachetomel soils are organic and Naniak soils are mineral both with sulfidic materials, flooded semi-diurnally with seawater, and support mangrove vegetation. Mesei soils are organic soils overlying clayey alluvium. Ngersuul is a better-drained version of the Dechel series and lacks stratification."

The soils are flooded very frequently for extremely brief periods, semi-diurnally, by high tides that fluctuate between about 30 centimeters (12 inches) above and 30 centimeters (12 inches) below the soil surface. These soils are ponded frequently for very long periods all months of the year."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are in Volcanic Mangrove Forest plant communities and are used for sediment catchment and some timber harvest for local use. The mangroves trap about 30% of sediments in Palau and other volcanic islands from entering their coral reefs; it is an important buffer protecting the reefs from excessive sedimentation or eutrophication. Eutrophication will lead to coral reef degradation and stimulate algae growth on corals.  These algae communities vigorously strip excess nutrients from the water as they grow much faster than the corals. As the algae blooms get much larger, they trap more sediment in the reefs and ultimately causing coral bleaching.  As the old algae decay, they consume the oxygen in the water; the low oxygen then will kill off fish, crabs, shrimp, and the living reef devastating tourism and fishing in these local island economies.\nMangrove forests are located adjacent to the sea and are affected by the semi-diurnal tidal cycle. The remaining areas of mangrove forest are located inland behind coastal strands, which were probably once open to the sea. Mangrove forests are generally closed-canopied with only a single to few mangrove species .The native vegetation is Rhizophora mucronata, R. apiculata, Sonneratia alba, Lumnitzera littorea, Bruguiera gymhorhize, Bruguiera sp., and Xylacarpus granatum. The moderate tree sizes and density of trees within the mangrove forest ecological type result in stands containing a relatively high biomass. The species are adapted to reproducing and surviving on the deep soils inundated with brackish seawater. Although the bottomland soils contain large quantities of organic material, the woody biomass above and below ground serves as an important reservoir of nutrients. The mangrove plant communities are efficient in cycling plant nutrients."
