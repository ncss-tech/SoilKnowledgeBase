  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ildefonso series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium and eolian sediments derived from quartzite, monzonite, granite, basalt, gneiss, schist and limestone. Ildefonso soils are on mesas, fan terraces, eroded fan remnants, escarpments, and hills. Slopes are 0 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.",

The soils formed from alluvium, colluvium and eolian materials derived from quartzite, monzonite, granite, basalt, gneiss, schist and limestone. Elevation ranges from 5,000 to 7,000 feet. Slope ranges from 0 to 75 percent. The average mean annual temperature is 48 to 55 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches. Frost-free period is 120 to 175 days. Some area outside of New Mexico have been correlated with elevations as low as 4500 feet, precipitation as high as 15 inches, temperatures as low as 42 degrees, and frost free period as long as 180 days."
