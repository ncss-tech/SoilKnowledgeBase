Buffcreek and Clapper soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Claprych soils have hue of 10YR throughout the solum. Placitas, and Seis soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to lithic or paralithic contacts. Raydawn soils have a lithologic discontinuity withing 80 inches. Strych soils are dry for longer periods of time (April through June)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils formed mostly on mesas, eroded fan remnants, escarpments, fan terraces, and hills. The soils formed from alluvium, colluvium and eolian materials derived from quartzite, monzonite, granite, basalt, gneiss, schist and limestone. Elevation ranges from 5,000 to 7,000 feet. Slope ranges from 0 to 75 percent. The average mean annual temperature is 48 to 55 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches. Frost-free period is 120 to 175 days. Some area outside of New Mexico have been correlated with elevations as low as 4500 feet, precipitation as high as 15 inches, temperatures as low as 42 degrees, and frost free period as long as 180 days."

Willard soils have more than 40 percent carbonates in the control section. Witt soils have less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser."
