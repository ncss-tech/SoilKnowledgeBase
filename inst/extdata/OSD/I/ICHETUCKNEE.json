    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum over limestone ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid in the A and E horizons, strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the Bt horizon, and moderately acid to neutral in the lower part of the Bt horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, and brown range from none to common.  Texture is fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has the same hues and values as the upper part but includes chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown, yellow, or red range from few to many.  Texture is sandy clay or clay.  Small limestone nodules and fragments range from none to common in the lower portion of the Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has the same hues and values as the upper part but includes chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown, yellow, or red range from few to many.  Texture is sandy clay or clay.  Small limestone nodules and fragments range from none to common in the lower portion of the Bt horizon.\nThe R or 2R horizon is composed of soft limestone that is rippable by power equipment.  It is interspersed with hard limestone fragments or boulders.  Solution holes up to 30 inches in diameter and ranging from few to many are filled with clay and extending to depths of 75 inches or more."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ichetucknee soils are on uplands of the Coastal Plain.  They formed in sandy and clayey marine sediments overlying limestone.  The climate is humid subtropical.  Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 67 to 69 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 55 to 59 inches."

All these soils lack lithic or paralithic contacts within 60 inches of the surface.  Albany and Blanton soils have sandy surface and subsurface 40 to 80 inches thick.  In addition, Blanton soils are moderately well drained to somewhat excessively well drained.  Bonneau and Surrency soils have sandy surface and subsurface horizons 20 to 40 inches thick.  In addition, Bonneau soils are well drained and Surrency soils are very poorly drained.  The moderately well drained Goldsboro soils have fine-loamy control sections."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the surface to about 13 inches (A and E horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from about 13 inches to about 55 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nLithic contact - Approximately 55 inches (R horizon).\nA perched water table is usually between depths of 1.5 to 3.0 feet for periods of 1 to 4 months during most years.  Much of this wetness is due to seepage from sloping areas.\nThis soil was formerly mapped as a variant of the Susquehanna series.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization pedon - S12-4-(1-4).  Sample by the Soil Characterization Lab, IFAS, Univ. of Florida, Gainesville.  Sampled 7/77.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
