  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Irson series consists of well drained soils which are shallow to hard igneous rock on mountain ridges and hillsides.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from igneous rock.  Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F.",

Depth to bedrock ranges from 8 to 20 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 7 to 13 inches.  The matrix of the particle-size control section is sandy clay loam or loam with 18 to 27 percent clay and more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  Igneous rock fragments range from 35 to 85 percent with 10 to 50 percent angular gravel or channers less than 3 inches in diameter, 10 to 40 percent angular cobbles or channers more than 3 inches in diameter, and 0 to 50 percent stones.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4."
