These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock over soft tuffaceous sandstone. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,950 to 2,140 meters.  The climate is cool, with cool moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C.; and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
