  "OVERVIEW": "The Ilton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks over soft tuffaceous sandstone.  The Ilton soils are on rock pediments overlain with alluvium and fan piedmont remnants with a rock core.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
