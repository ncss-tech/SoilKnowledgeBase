    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nArgillic horizon:  The zone from 6 to 37 inches.  (Bt1 and Bt2, 2Btk)\nCalcic horizon:  The zone from 37 to 44 inches.  (2Bk1)\nLithologic discontinuity:  The discontinuity with clayey residuum at 22 inches.  (2Btk, 2Bk1, and 2Bk2)\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 6 to 26 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, and 2Btk)\nSoil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999\nThese soils are borderline mesic-frigid.  Future temperature studies are needed to resolve this issue.\nGiven the right conditions the Mancos shale weathers easily and completely.  In this pedon no, or very little, evidence of the original rock structure is seen below 22 inches.  However, because the landform is stable and there is no evidence the lower part of this pedon has moved, the parent material is considered to be residuum.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
