  "OVERVIEW": "The Ilex series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits derived from sandstone over clayey residuum weathered from shale.  Ilex soils are on hills. Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nArgillic horizon:  The zone from 6 to 37 inches.  (Bt1 and Bt2, 2Btk)\nCalcic horizon:  The zone from 37 to 44 inches.  (2Bk1)\nLithologic discontinuity:  The discontinuity with clayey residuum at 22 inches.  (2Btk, 2Bk1, and 2Bk2)\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 6 to 26 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, and 2Btk)\nSoil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999\nThese soils are borderline mesic-frigid.  Future temperature studies are needed to resolve this issue.\nGiven the right conditions the Mancos shale weathers easily and completely.  In this pedon no, or very little, evidence of the original rock structure is seen below 22 inches.  However, because the landform is stable and there is no evidence the lower part of this pedon has moved, the parent material is considered to be residuum."
