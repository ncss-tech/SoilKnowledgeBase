  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Organic matter content in the A horizon ranges from 5 to 18 percent. In the substratum organic matter is variable and ranges from 1 to 10 percent. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout the soil profile. Salinities are less than 2 Mmhos.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y or neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2. It is mucky silt loam, mucky loam, silt loam or loam.\nThe Cg horizon has a hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is loam, sandy loam, loamy sand or sand.\nA 2Cg horizon, where present, has similar properties to the Cg horizon and can be identified in areas where the deposited material has originated from areas where a silt mantle dominates the surrounding uplands."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no known series in the same family. Competing series in a closely related families are the Ballahack, Johnston and Polawana soils. Ballahack and Polawana soils have mixed mineralogy and are thermic. Johnston soils have a thermic temperature regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Indiantown soils are nearly level soils located on narrow low gradient flood plains of the mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain. The slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. These soils formed in loamy fluvial sediments overlying sandy alluvial and marine sediments. Mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 48 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fallsington, Hurlock, Askecksy, Kentuck, Mullica, Manahawkin, Chicone, and Zekiah soils. Fallsington, Hurlock, Askecksy, Kentuck, and Mullica soils are at slightly higher elevations above the floodplain on adjacent low-lying uplands. Manahawkin and Chicone soils occur at slightly lower elevation within the floodplain. Zekiah soils are found on narrow flood plains in the upper reaches of streams and may also be found intermingled with Indiantown soils."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained. Runoff is very slow. Permeability is moderate in the surface and moderately rapid to rapid in the substratum. A seasonal high water table ranging from 6 inches above to 6 inches below the soil surface is present from September to June. These soils are flooded for brief periods during storm events."

Native vegetation includes Red Maple (Acer rubrum), Blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), Water Oak (Quercus nigra), and Baldcypress (Taxodium distichum). The understory includes Sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana), American Holly (Ilex opaca), Highbush Blueberry (Vaccinium corybosum) and sedges (Carex spp.)."
