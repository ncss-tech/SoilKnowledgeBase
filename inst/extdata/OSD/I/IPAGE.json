Geographic Setting: revised; Geographically Associated Soils: revised, deleted Inavale and Ord soils as these soils do not occur at the new type location, added Nenzel and Marlake soils as these soils occur at the new type location; Use and Vegetation: revised\nThese soils were included with Inavale and Valentine soils in older surveys. The alkali substratum phase previously recognized will be recorrelated to the Wildhorse or similar series.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data is available from the National Soil Survey Center, Soil Survey Laboratory for the typical pedon, Pedon ID 87NE031101.
