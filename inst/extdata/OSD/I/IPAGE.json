  "OVERVIEW": "The Ipage series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in eolian sands on interdunes of sandhills in the Nebraska Sandhills (MLRA 65). Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 52 centimeters (20 inches) at the type location.",
