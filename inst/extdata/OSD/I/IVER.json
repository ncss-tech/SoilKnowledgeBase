  "OVERVIEW": "The Iver series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess over residual material and colluvium derived from quartz, sandstone, shale and quartzite.  Iver soils are on side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
