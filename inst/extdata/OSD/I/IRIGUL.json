The mean summer soils temperature ranges from 53 to 59 degrees F.  The particle size control section is very channery loam, extremely channery loam, very channery clay loam, or extremely channery clay loam averaging 18 to 35 percent clay.  Flat rock fragments less than 6 inches in the longest dimension range from 35 to 75 percent.  Fragments larger than 3 inches in diameter range from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is slightly acid through mildly alkaline."

The soils formed in material weathered from underlying schist or metamorphic rock.  Elevation is 7,000 to 8,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 to 22 inches of which about half falls as snow or rain in April, May, and June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 33 degrees to 44 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature ranges form 52 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 60 to 90 days."
