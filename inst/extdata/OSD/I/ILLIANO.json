    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:   Soil interpretive record: MT1742.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from the surface to 7 inches mxied (A and part of the Bw horizon); a cambic horizon from 4 to 11 inches (Bw horizon); welded tuff bedrock at 11 inches (R horizon).  Illiano soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on udic.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Ashy-skeletal, glassy Lithic Eutrocryepts to Ashy-skeletal, glassy Lithic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
