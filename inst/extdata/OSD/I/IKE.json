  "OVERVIEW": "The Ike series consists of shallow, well drained soils over limestone bedrock.  They are found on ridgetops and sideslopes of mountains and foothills and formed in colluvium, slope alluvium, and residuum from limestone.  Slopes run form 10 to 90 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  Annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual soil temperature averages about 50 degrees F.",
