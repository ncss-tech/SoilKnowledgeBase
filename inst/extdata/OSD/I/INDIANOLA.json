  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Keystone series. Keystone soils are dry in the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Similar series classified in a mixed mineralogy family but are likely isotic as well are Birdsview, Greenwater, and Pilchuck series. Birdsview soils are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Greenwater soils have 5 to 25 percent volcanic ash, cinders, and pumice in the control section. Pilchuck soils have chroma of 2 or less throughout the control section, and have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Indianola soils are on hills, terraces, terrace escarpments, eskers, or kames of drift or outwash plains at elevations of near sea level to 1,000 feet. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent. These soils formed in sandy glacial drift and minor amounts of volcanic ash. They are in a maritime climate of cool dry summers and mild wet winters. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 55 inches most of which falls between October and April. Mean January temperature is 36 degrees F., the average July temperature is 62 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F. The frost-free season ranges from 180 to 240 days."

Alderwood, Sinclair, and Tokul soils have dense glacial till at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Cassolary soils are fine-loamy. Everett, Hoypus and Spanaway soils are sandy-skeletal. Kitsap soils are fine- silty. Nisqually soils have an umbric epipedon. Quilcene soils have a fine control section and are underlain by weathered shale at depths of 20 to 40 inches."
