  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These were formerly mapped as Henneke soils in San Benito County, 1969. They are being differentiated by having a loamy-skeletal particle size control section.\nADDITIONAL DATA: The modal pedon ID for the Idriapeak Series is S09CA069003 (Pedon Number 09N0922). Additional supporting pedons are 90CA069065, 90CA069015, 90CA069088, and 90CA069003. Mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm (20 inches) is 16.7 degrees C (62 degrees F) at the typical profile site, based on 1 year's data (8/1/2009-8/1/2010) measured with a Hobo Soil Temperature Recorder.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
