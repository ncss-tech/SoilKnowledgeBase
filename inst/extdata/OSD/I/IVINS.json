    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features found in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 4 inches (A horizon).\nBuried horizons - the zone from 24 to 64 inches (2Btb, 2Btkb, and 2Bkb horizons).\nThe soil is classified based on the properties of the sandy mantle.  The family classification is based on the whole soil. The classification fails Psamments because the loamy buried soil occurs within 1 meter.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015. The last revision to the series was 6/2005. ET\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
