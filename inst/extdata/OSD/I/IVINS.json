  "OVERVIEW": "The Ivins series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy eolian deposits dominantly from sandstone and shale over consolidated volcanic ash material.  The Ivins soils are on desert benches and terraces.  Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches.",

The family classification is based on the whole soil. The classification fails Psamments because the loamy buried soil occurs within 1 meter.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015. The last revision to the series was 6/2005. ET"
