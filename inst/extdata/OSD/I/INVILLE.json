  "OVERVIEW": "The Inville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium and glacial outwash. Inville soils are on alluvial fans and outwash terraces. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

These soils formed in alluvium and glacial outwash from mixed parent rocks consisting of volcanics and granitics but dominantly from andesite. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. Elevations are 1525 to 2275 meters. Mean annual precipitation is 480 to 990 mm, most of which comes as winter snow. The mean annual temperature is 5 to 8 degrees C., mean January temperature is -3 to -1 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 15 to 17 degrees C."
