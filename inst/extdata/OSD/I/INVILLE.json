  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Inville soils occur on gently sloping to moderately steep alluvial fans and outwash terraces. These soils formed in alluvium and glacial outwash from mixed parent rocks consisting of volcanics and granitics but dominantly from andesite. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. Elevations are 1525 to 2275 meters. Mean annual precipitation is 480 to 990 mm, most of which comes as winter snow. The mean annual temperature is 5 to 8 degrees C., mean January temperature is -3 to -1 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 15 to 17 degrees C."

Also, they are underlain by decomposed granite and have less than 35 percent rock fragments in their control sections. Jorge soils have andic subgroup properties."
