Benthic fauna such as tubeworms, clams, juvenile blue crabs, scallops and juvenile finfish are common.\nDominant Vegetation: Native vegetation includes rooted algae, eelgrass (Zostera marina) and widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima).  Vegetative cover ranges from 0 to 100 percent depending on landform.  Active flood tidal deltas are often devoid of vegetation as their strong tidal currents limit successful growth."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Indian River soils were formerly included with areas of water.  They are distinguished by being permanently covered by estuarine waters that support submersed aquatic vegetation.   The name comes from the local Indian River Inlet feeds into Indian River and Rehoboth's Bay in Delaware where the soil was first described.\nDiagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nPeraquic feature--the zone from 0 to 65 inches (0 to 166 centimeters) is permanently saturated\nReduced conditions--the zone from 0 to 65 inches (0 to 166 centimeters).\nFluventic feature--an irregular decrease in organic carbon from a depth of 10to 49 inches (25 to 125 centimeters).\nParticle--size control section--the zone from 0 to 40 inches (0 to 100 centimeters).\nPsammowassents--less than 35 percent (by volume) rock fragments and a texture\nclass of loamy fine sand or coarser in all layers within the particle-size\ncontrol section.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNASIS Site and Pedon ID: 2014NJ029010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
