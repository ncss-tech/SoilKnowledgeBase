  "OVERVIEW": "The Insidert series consists of moderately deep to duripan, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in alluvium and loess from basalt and volcanic ash.  Insidert soils are on calderas.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.",
