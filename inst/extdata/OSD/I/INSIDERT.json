These soils formed in alluvium and loess from basalt and volcanic ash.  The climate is cool and moist in winter and warm and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 280 to 330 mm.  Average annual temperature ranges from 5.6 to 7.2 degrees C.  Frost-free period is 75 to 90 days."

The remainder of the OSD has not been updated since 5/93.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon:\nMollic epipedon - The zone 0 to 23 cm (A and Bt1 horizons).\nAbrupt textural change - at 15 cm, estimated 19 percent clay increase within 1 inch (upper boundary of Bt1 horizon).\nArgillic horizon - The zone 15 to 43 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nCalcic horizon - The zone 43 to 61 cm (Bkq horizon).\nDuripan - The zone 61 to 69 cm (Bkqm horizon).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 69 cm (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 15 to 43 cm.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
