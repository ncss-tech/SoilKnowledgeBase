  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The volcanic ash mantle is 20 to 30 inches thick.  Depth to a paralithic contact of weathered basalt is greater than 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.   The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from May 1 to November 10 and exceeds 47 degrees F. from June 1 to October 20.  The soil is dry in the 8 to 24 inch moisture control section from mid-July to mid-October and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  The bulk density ranges from 0.6 to 1 g/cc to a depth of 10 to 20 inches but is 0.85 g/cc at a depth of 10 to 14 inches.  There are 5 to 35 percent angular or subangular rock fragments of andesite or basalt in the ash deposits to depths of 20 to 30 inches.  The fragments commonly are cobbles and stones but range from fine gravel to a few large boulders.  The buried soil material has 35 to 80 percent rock fragments that are similar to the overlying ash deposits.  In addition there is saprolitic gravel and cobbles that make up 5 to 15 percent in the buried horizons.  The soil is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon is dark grayish brown, grayish brown, brown, dark reddish gray, reddish gray, or reddish brown (10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 5/2, 5/4; 5YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3).  Moist colors are very dark gray, dark brown, or dark reddish brown (10YR 3/2, 3/3; 7.5YR 3/2; 5YR 3/2, 3/3).  The base saturation ranges from 40 to 60 percent but is less than 50 percent in at least part of the upper 10 inches.  The NaF pH ranges from 9.6 to 10.7.  Clay content ranges from 3 to 10 percent.\nThe B2t horizon is brown, yellowish brown, pale brown, light yellowish brown, reddish brown, or light reddish brown (10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 5/4, 6/4; 5YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4).  Moist colors range from dark brown to reddish brown or dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4; 7.5YR 4/4; 5YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4).  Clay content is about 5 to 12 percent and has only 1 to 2 percent increase in clay over the A horizon.   Commonly there are a few thin clay films in the lower part of the B1 or B2t horizons.  The base saturation ranges from 30 to 60 percent.  The NaF pH 1s 9.0 to 10.0.\nThe IIBtb horizon colors are similar to the B2t horizon.  It is very stony sandy loam, extremely stony loam, or extremely stony sandy clay loam and has 5 to 12 percent clay in the lower part.  The base saturation is 50 to 60 percent and commonly increases slightly with depth.  The NaF pH ranges from 8.5 to 9.0.  This horizon has slightly less influence from amorphous materials."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Iller soils are on older surfaces of volcanic uplands where more recent volcanic ash has been deposited over materials weathered from tuff, tuff breccias, or hard andesite or basaltic bedrock.  Slopes are 9 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 5,000 to 7,500 feet.  The climate is continental and subhumid with warm nearly dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 20 to 45 inches.  Snowfall is 24 to 48 inches, and covers the higher elevations from late November to early April in most years.  Mean January temperature is 22 to 28 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 37 to 45 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 35 to 60 days."

Avis and Oosen soils have an ochric epipedon and an ashy or ashy skeletal control section.  Bogus soils have a thick mollic epipedon and a fine textured argillic horizon.  Esro soils have an aquic moisture regime and a fine-silty control section.  Orset soils have an ochric epipedon and a coarse-loamy control section. Pinehurst soils have a thick mollic epipedon and a fine-loamy argillic horizon."

Competing series were not checked at that time.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Sampled for characterization 6/74 by the Riverside Laboratory, pedon No. S74-CA-093-6.\nOSED scanned by SSQA.
