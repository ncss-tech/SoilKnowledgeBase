    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Iron Blossom soils are on toe slopes of alluvial fans and basin-fill plains at elevations of 1,370 to 1,460 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with moderate amounts of pyroclastic materials.  The average annual temperature is 8.3 to 9 degrees C.; average annual precipitation is 175 to 200 mm; and the frost-free season is about l00 to l05 days."

Dunphy soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections and are saturated within 100 cm.  Rad soils have coarse-silty particle-size control sections.  Rosney soils have fine-silty particle-size control sections and lack Cq horizons."
