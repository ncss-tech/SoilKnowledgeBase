  "OVERVIEW": "The Ingersoll series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in stratified silty deposits on lake plains, outwash plains, and deltas. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 7.8 degrees C (46 degrees F).",
