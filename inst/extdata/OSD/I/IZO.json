Individual thin strata are noneffervescent in some pedons.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: 0 to 5 percent.\nRock fragments: Averages 50 to 75 percent, mainly gravel larger than 13 mm in diameter.  Lithology of fragments is mixed.\nA horizon\nValue: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.\nOther features: This horizon commonly is structureless or has finely stratified rock structure and does not qualify as an ochric epipedon.\nC horizons\nHue: 10YR or 2.5Y.\nValue: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist.\nStructure: Massive or single grain.\nConsistence: Loose or soft, loose or very friable.\nTexture: Stratified coarse sand, sand, loamy sand, and loamy coarse sand.\nRock fragments: 50 to 75 percent, predominantly gravel. Individual strata range from 15 to 85 percent rock fragments.\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates: Some pedons have up to 50 percent of the undersides of rock fragments in any subhorizon covered with thin lime coats."

Gynelle soils have strata of sandy loam within the particle-size control section. Inmo and Itme soils are dominated by fine gravel (less than 10 mm in diameter).  Ioka soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 9 degrees C. Gynelle, Leo, and Wardenot soils have sandy loam horizons. Izamatch soils do not have thin stratification, have lime accumulation at 38 to 50 cm, and contain 30 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the lower part of the profile. Nepalto soils are not stratified, have texture of very fine sandy loam in the upper 20 to 36 cm of the soil and have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR. Willwood soils have mean annual soil temperature of 9 to 10 degrees C, have less than 50 percent coarse and very coarse sands, and are not moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October."
