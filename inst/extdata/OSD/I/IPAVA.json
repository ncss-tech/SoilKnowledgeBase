Slope gradients typically are between 1 and 3 percent and range from 0 to 5 percent. Ipava soils formed in loess. Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 13.3 degrees C (50 to 56 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1,016 mm (36 to 40 inches). Frost-free period ranges from 160 to 190 days. Elevation is 180 to 250 meters (590 to 820 feet) above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Buckhart, Clarksdale, Denny, Osco, Sable, and Virden soils. Clarksdale soils are on similar landscapes nearby, but are typically nearer the drainageways. The poorly drained Denny soils have albic horizons and are in depressional areas. The well drained Osco and moderately well drained Buckhart soils contain less clay in the subsoil and are more sloping or are on narrower ridges in areas with greater relief. The poorly drained Sable soils contain less clay in the subsoil and are nearby on the parts of the inter-stream divides with lowest relief. The poorly drained Virden soils typically are nearby on the parts of the inter-stream divides with lowest relief."

An apparent seasonal high water table is at a depth of 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) below the surface at some time between January and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low to moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderately slow (0.2 to 0.6 inches per hour)."
