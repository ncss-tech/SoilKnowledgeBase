  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum is about 10 to 23 inches thick and depth to vesicular bedrock is about 20 to 43 inches. The fragments of bedrock in the soil are porous and range in size from gravel to stone. Rock outcrops are common. Soil temperature is about 54 to 57 degrees and mineralogy is mixed.\nThe soils are dry during the summer months most years between depths of 8 and 28 inches.\nThe A11 horizon has colors in lOYR and 7.5YR hues with values of 3 to 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist. Chromas are 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe A12 and C horizons have colors in the lOYR hue with values of 4 or 5 dry and 3 moist. Chroma is 4. Textures are gravelly or very gravelly loam or silt loam, structure is weak granular, and consistence is soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic. Reaction is neutral throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Inskip soils occur in sloping to steep mountainous areas on relatively recent lava flows. They occur at elevations of 1,000 to 5,000 feet, in a humid mesothermal climate with mean annual rainfall of 35 to 50 inches, with hot dry summers and cool wet winters. Mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees, average January temperature about 38 degrees, and average July temperature about 70 degrees. Frost-free season averages about 130 days."

The classification was updated in February 2001 using the Eighth Edition to Soil Taxonomy. This series was formerly classified as loamy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Dystric Xerochrepts. Lab data was not available at that time, this soil may be Vitrandic or Andic subgroup. Competing series were not checked at that time.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
