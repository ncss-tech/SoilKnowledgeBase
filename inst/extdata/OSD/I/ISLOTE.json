  "OVERVIEW": "The Islote series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in fine textured sediments overlying calcareous sandstone.  They are gently sloping and sloping soils on terraces and low hills in the coastal plain.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches and the mean annual temperatue is about 78 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to the partially cemented calcareous sandstone varies from 27 to 43 inches.  Thickness of the argillic horizon ranges from 21 to 33 inches.  Clay films in the argillic horizon are thin patchy or discontinuous.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 75 to 77 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hues of 7.5YR or 5YR, values of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is clay or sandy clay.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky.\nThe Bt horizons have hues of 2.5YR to 10R, values of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Structure is weak or moderate, medium or coarse subangular blocky.  Reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon is calcareous sandstone that can be penetrated with the spade. In places, it is borderline to a Cr horizon."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other known series in the same family.  The Fajardo, Juncal, San Sebastian, Rio Arriba, Rio Lajas, Tanama and Via soils are similar soils in related families.  The Fajardo and Rio Arriba soils have shrink-swell behavior and lack the cemented calcareous sandstone.  The Juncal soils have thicker argillic horizons and are yellower.  The San Sebastain soils have coarse fragments and calcareous throughout.  The Rio Lajas soils are sandy throughout.  The Tanama soils are shallow to hard calcareous limestone.  The Via soils are acid and coarse textured throughout."
