  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to siltstone or mudstone ranges from 8 to 20 inches.  Soil fines and siltstone bedrock contain free carbonate throughout.  Blocky fragments of siltstone are mixed throughout the soil mass.  The soil is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay loam, loam, or silt loam and averages between 23 and 35 percent clay.  Fragments of siltstone comprise about 5 to 15 percent by volume.\nThe AC and Cr horizons have hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR; value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 1 to 3.  The AC horizon is gravelly analogs of clay loam or silty clay loam averaging 27 to 34 percent clay, 30 to 60 percent silt and 10 to 30 percent sand.  Fragments of siltstone comprise about 35 to 80 percent by volume of the AC horizon.  Some pedons have a C horizon.  Roots extend into bedded siltstone along fractures.  Accumulations of carbonate are as coatings on faces of bedrock fractures and as few or common, medium or coarse accumulations in the Cr horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Slope gradients typically are greater than 6 percent but range from 3 to 40 percent.  These soils formed in residuum weathered from siltstone and mudstone.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 49 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 18 inches."

Blackpipe and Conata soils have fine textures and in addition, Blackpipe soils are on slightly lower positions on the landscape.  Epping soils have less than 35 percent by volume of coarse fragments in the series control section.  Keota and Norrest soils have bedrock below depths of 20 inches and in addition, Keota soils are coarse-silty and Norrest soils are on less sloping areas.  Conata, Epping, and Keota soils are in similar positions on the landscape as Imlay soils."
