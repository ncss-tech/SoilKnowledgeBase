  "OVERVIEW": "The Ikit series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from limestone.  Ikit soils are on foothill and mountain slopes and have slopes of 25 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:   The soil moisture regime is xeric bordering on aridic.  The soil moisture control section, in 6 or more out of 10 years, is dry in all parts for 60 or more consecutive days in the 4 months following the summer solstice, and moist in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days in the 4 months following the winter solstice.  Also, in 6 or more out of 10 years, the moisture control section is moist in some part for more than half the cumulative days per year when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches from the soil surface is higher than 41 degrees F., and for 90 or more consecutive days when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is higher than 46 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  and the mean summer soil temperature is 68 to 70 degrees F.\nThe depth to fractured limestone ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Calcium carbonate content of the whole soil, size fractions less than 20 mm, ranges from 40 to 60 percent; for the less than 2 mm fraction, it ranges from 15 to 40 percent.  Rock fragments average 35 to 60 percent in the control section and are mostly gravel and cobbles derived from limestone, conglomerate, and sandstone. Clay content in the particle size control section ranges from 18 to 27 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 5 through 8.  Texture is gravelly loam or very gravelly loam.  Reaction is moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 4 through 8.  Texture is very gravelly loam.  Reaction is strongly alkaline."
