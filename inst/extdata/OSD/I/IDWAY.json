  "OVERVIEW": "Idway series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Idway soils are on alluvial flats, beach plains, and basin-floor remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 cm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
