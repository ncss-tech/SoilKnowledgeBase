  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ironton soils are on low lake terraces and flood plains.  These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks that are dominantly quartzite, gneiss, and limestone.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 4,750 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 130 to 170 days."

Draper, Sunset and Woods Cross soils lack calcic horizons.  Logan and Roshe Springs soils contain more than 18 percent clay in the control section."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; low or medium surface runoff; moderate permeability (moderately high or high saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 2 and 3 feet (moderately deep free water occurrence class) between April and September.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods year-round."

Drained areas are used for growing alfalfa, sugar beets, truck crops, small grains and improved pasture.  The vegetation is mainly inland saltgrass, foxtail, alkali sacaton, and Kentucky bluegrass."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 21 inches (A1, A2, and ABk horizons).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 16 to 48 inches (ABk, Bk1, and Bk2 horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 24 and 36 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (ABk and Bk1 horizons and parts of the A2 and Bk2 horizons).\nThe oxyaquic subgroup placement is tentative.  This series has not been examined in the field since 1965 and additional field work is needed to determine the presence of redoximorphic features and the limits of the seasonal high water table.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 138-139, Table 11 of the Soil Survey of Davis-Weber Area, Utah.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
