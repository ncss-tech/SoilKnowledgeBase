The soil moisture control section is moist from approximately December 1 to March 31 (about 110 to 140 days), and is dry in all parts from approximately May 1 to September 31 (about 150 to 170 days).  The particle-size control section averages 8 to 15 percent clay.  Mineralogy is mixed.  Disseminated lime ranges from the surface to at least 40 inches, (102 cm) deep and the soil is very slightly effervescent to violently effervescent.  Calcium carbonate ranges from 1 to 4 percent throughout.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 4 percent at the surface, and decreases regularly with depth.  A fluctuating water table can occur below 72 inches, (183 cm) from December through March.  Some pedons have a thin (3 to 8 inches, (8 to 20 cm) thick) weakly cemented layer within the Bk horizon.  This silica cementation comprises less than 20 percent of the layer.\nThe Akp horizon dry color is 10YR 4/2, 5/2 or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3.  Clay content ranges from 8 to 20 percent.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nThe Ak horizon dry color is 10YR 4/2, 5/2 or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Clay content ranges from 8 to 15 percent.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk and Bkq horizons dry color is 10YR 5/3, 6/2, 6/3 or 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/3 or 4/4.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Clay content ranges from 8 to 15 percent.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline."
