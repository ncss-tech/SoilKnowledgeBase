  "OVERVIEW": "The Iredell series consists of moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. These soils formed in material weathered from diabase, diorite, gabbro, and other rocks high in ferro-magnesium minerals. They are on uplands throughout the Piedmont. Slope is dominantly less than 6 percent but ranges up to 15 percent.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to paralithic contact (Cr horizon) is 40 to more than 60 inches. Depth to hard bedrock is more than 60 inches. Linear extensibility totals 6.0 cm or more between the surface and paralithic contact. Most pedons have few to many dark concretions throughout the profile. Many pedons have few to many dark mottles or soft bodies in the B and C horizons. Some pedons have few to many flakes of mica or crystals of feldspar in the B and C horizons. The soil is strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon, moderately acid to mildly alkaline in the B horizon, and neutral to moderately alkaline in the C horizon. Content of rock fragments, up to 24 inches in diameter, ranges from 0 to 30 percent in the A horizon and E horizon, 0 to 20 percent in the Bt horizon, and 0 to 10 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nA thin or discontinuous E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe upper part of the Bt or Btss horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. The middle part of the Bt or Btss horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. The lower part of the Bt ot Btss horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Content of clay in the Bt or Btss horizon ranges from 40 to 85 percent in the upper part and from 35 to 60 percent in the middle and lower part. The weighted average content of clay of the upper 20 inches of the Bt or Btss horizon ranges from 40 to 60 percent.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. Mottles may occur in shades of red brown, or yellow. Texture is clay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon commonly is mottled or multicolored in shades of white, gray, brown, yellow, or black. It commonly is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or silt loam with as much as 90 percent soft pararock fragments.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, is highly fractured, highly weathered rock."

Polkton soils have a depth to a seasonal high water table of 1.5 to 2.5 feet, a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches and formed from Triassic siltstone, mudstone, shale, and conglomerates. White Store soils have a depth to seasonal high water table of 1.0 to 1.5 feet and are formed from Triassic siltstone, musdtone, sandstone, shale, and conglomerate. Similar soils in other families are the Brewback, Crawfordville, Enon, Frogsboro, Pittsboro, Virgilina, Winnsboro, and Wynott series. Brewback soils have iron depletions in the upper part of the argillic and a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Crawfordville soils  have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Enon and Winnsboro soils do not have slickensides and have a depth to a seasonal high water table at greater than 6 feet. Frogsboro soils is somewhat poorly drained and has smectitic mineralogy.  Pittsboro and Wynott soils have a depth to paralithic contact of 20 to 40 inches.  Virgilina soils have smectitic mineralogy and a depth to lithic contact of 20 to 40 inches."

The eighth edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 1998 changed the requirements for Vertic subgroups and now these soils fit.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 7 inches (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 7 to 24 inches (Btss1, Btss2, and Bt horizons)\nMLRA = 136"
