  "OVERVIEW": "The Incell series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Quaternary age.  These soils are in depressions of the South Texas Coastal Plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 23 degrees C (73 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 690 mm (27 in).",
