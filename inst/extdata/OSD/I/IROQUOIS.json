  "REVDATE": "03/2004",
  "STATES": "IN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Iroquois series consist of deep, very poorly drained soils formed in loamy outwash and are underlain by clayey sediments on lake plains.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and slow in the underlying material.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

It ranges from medium acid to neutral.  Gravel content is less than 2 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 5Y, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Bt horizon is sandy clay loam, clay loam or sandy loam.  The clay content dominantly ranges from 18 to 25 percent.  In many pedons thin subhorizons up to 4 inches thick are in the lower most part of the Bt horizon and contain somewhat more clay.  The Bt horizon ranges from medium acid to neutral.  Gravel content is less than 2 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral and has value of 6.  It is clay or silty clay and the clay content ranges from 45 to 60 percent.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
