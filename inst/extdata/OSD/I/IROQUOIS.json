  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum is 24 to 38 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It ranges from medium acid to neutral.  Gravel content is less than 2 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 5Y, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Bt horizon is sandy clay loam, clay loam or sandy loam.  The clay content dominantly ranges from 18 to 25 percent.  In many pedons thin subhorizons up to 4 inches thick are in the lower most part of the Bt horizon and contain somewhat more clay.  The Bt horizon ranges from medium acid to neutral.  Gravel content is less than 2 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral and has value of 6.  It is clay or silty clay and the clay content ranges from 45 to 60 percent.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Darroch soils do not have contrasting textures and are on slightly higher lying positions in the landscape.  Montgomery soils have more clay in the upper part of the solum and are on similar landscape positions.  Seward soils have arenic layers, are moderately well drained, and are on higher lying landscape positions.  Rensselaer soils do not have contrasting textures and are on similar lanscape positions.  Strole soils have more clay in the upper part of the solum and on slightly higher lying landscape positions."
