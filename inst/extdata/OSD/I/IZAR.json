These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from dolomite, tuff, conglomerate, sandstone, and related calcareous sedimentary rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,520 to 2,200 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
