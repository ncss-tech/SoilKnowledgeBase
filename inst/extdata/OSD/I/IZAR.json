  "OVERVIEW": "The Izar series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from dolomite, tuff, conglomerate and sandstone.  Izar soils are on hills, fan remnants, and rock pediments.  Slopes are 0 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
