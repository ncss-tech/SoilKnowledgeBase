  "OVERVIEW": "The Ionia series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy sediments over gravelly deposits on outwash plains, terraces, valley trains, and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 12.8 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
