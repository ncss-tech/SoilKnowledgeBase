    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Ionia soils are on outwash plains, terraces, valley trains, and ground moraines. Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent, but typically are 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in loamy sediments over gravelly deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 635 to 889 mm (25 to 35 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 13.9 degrees C (45 to 57 degrees F)."
