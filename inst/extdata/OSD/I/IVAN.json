  "OVERVIEW": "The Ivan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous silty alluvium.  Ivan soils are on flood plains in the Bluestem Hills, MLRA 76.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 910 millimeters (36 inches)and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",

Added \"very\" and \"calcareous, silty\" in the first sentence in paragraph 1.\n2.  Added wet consistence to the typical pedon.\n3.  Removed solumn thickness from range in characteristic section.\n4.  Removed all non-competing series from the range paragraph.\n5. In geographic setting paragraph changed the mean annual temperature range to 12 to 14 degrees C (54 to 58 degrees F).\n6. LRR=H\nConverted to semitabular from narrative.\n(BCE, 12/00)\n10/17/05 JCR LM\nAdded metric conversion, updated competing series and changed permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.\n1/2015 DJK Updated climate data in intro and geographic setting. Added Ap horizon to typical pedon from the Chase County TUD which initially had separated the Ap and A horizons. Added mollic thickness, soil temp. sand content, and rock fragments to RIC. Added slightly alkaline to RIC for A. Changed Ksat to moderately high. Updated Distribution and Extent.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
