  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 20 to 30 inches thick. Depth to consolidated bedrock ranges from 42 to 72 inches. The content of coarse fragments in the control section ranges from 35 to 85 percent increasing downward. Average annual soil temperature is 47 degrees to 59 degrees F. These soils are usually dry for more than 90 cumulative days but less than 60 consecutive days in the section from 8 to 25 inches. The driest periods occur between October and June. The solum ranges from neutral to mildly alkaline in the upper part to strongly alkaline in the lower part. The A horizon have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It has 1 to 4 percent organic matter. The B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist with chroma of 3 through 5 dry or moist. It is heavy sandy loam or sandy clay loam containing 18 to 35 percent clay. The C1ca horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry and 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 3 through 6 dry and moist. Carbonate varies from finely divided and nonvisible forms in the B2t horizon to few medium soft masses and thin discontinuous caliche coatings on the bottom sides of coarse fragments in the C1ca horizon.Carbonate content of the C1ca horizon ranges from 5 to 15 percent."

Majada soils have calcic horizons. Montoso soils have sola 9 to 20 inches thick and have cinders at depths of 12 to 32 inches.
