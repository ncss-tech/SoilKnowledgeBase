The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from July to mid October (about 90 to 120 days).  The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches exceeds 41 degrees F from about March 15 to December 1 (255 days), and exceeds 47 degrees F from about April 15 to November 15.  Base saturation is above 60 percent in some part of the 10 to 30 inch zone, and ranges from 50 to 70 percent.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/3, 5/2, 6/3, 4/2, 7/3, 4/3, 4/4, or 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 4/3, 3/4, or 4/4.  Some subhorizon above 10 inches has dry value of 6 or more, and moist value or chroma of 4.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 5/3, 6/3, 6/4, 5/2, 7/4, or 7/3.  Moist color is 10YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6 or 5/8.  It is extremely gravelly sandy loam, extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, very gravelly loam, or extremely gravelly loam.  The B horizon in some pedons lack clay films.  In pedons with clay films the B horizon contains less than 1.2 times the amount of clay in the horizons above."
