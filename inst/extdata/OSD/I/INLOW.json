The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F from about March 15 to December 1 (255 days) and is above 47 degrees F from about April 15 to November 15 (210 days).  The soil between depths of 6 and 16 inches is dry in all parts from June 10 to November 15 (155 days).  Moisture control section is dry more than one half the time the soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F. Pebbles range from 0 to 5 percent of the soil, by volume.  Exchangable sodium percentage is 35 to 80 percent in the textural control section.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/1, 6/2, 7/1, or 7/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2 or 5/2.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It is silt loam with 10 to 15 percent clay.  Electrical conductivity ranges from 0 to 2.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/1, 6/3, 7/1 or 7/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/3, 4/2, 4/3 or 5/3.  Reaction is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.  The Bt horizon is silt loam, loam, or clay loam and averges 18 to 35 percent clay with at least 4 percent more clay content than the A horizon.  Electrical conductivity ranges from 2 to 4.\nThe BqK horizon is very firm or extremely firm when moist.  Thickness of duripan ranges from 22 to 30 inches thick.\nThe 2C horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 7/2 7/3 or 8/3 and moist color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3 or 5/4.

The climate is semi-arid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 to 12 inches.  Snowfall is 20 to 30 inches.  The average annual temperature is about 46 to 50 degrees F.  The average January temperature is about 30 degrees F and the average July temperature is about 65 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 30 to 50 days."
