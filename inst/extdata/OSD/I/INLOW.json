  "OVERVIEW": "The Inlow series consist of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits and alluvium from volcanic ash and other extrusive igneous rock sources.  Inlow soils are on lake terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
