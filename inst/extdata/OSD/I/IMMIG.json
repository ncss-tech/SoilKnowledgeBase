They formed in colluvium derived dominantly from basalt, greenstone or welded tuff. Elevations are 2,000 to 4,000 feet and range up to 5,550 feet in Idaho. The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 20 inches. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days and up to 160 days in Idaho."
