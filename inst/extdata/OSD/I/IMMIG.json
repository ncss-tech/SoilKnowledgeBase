  "OVERVIEW": "The Immig series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium derived dominantly from basalt. Immig soils are on foothills and canyonsides. Slopes range from 2 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
