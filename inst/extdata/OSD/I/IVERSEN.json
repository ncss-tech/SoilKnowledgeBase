    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 53 to 57 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter temperature is 4 to 9 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 6 and 20 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to June 1 and is dry in all or some parts from July 1 to October 1 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages from 40 to 55 percent clay.  Clay mineralogy is dominated by 1 to 1 lattice clays.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/3, 5/4; 7.5YR 5/4 or 6/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6 or 5/4.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 27 percent. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  Reaction is moderately or slightly acid.\nAn E horizon is present at the surface in some pedons.  It is 10YR 7/1, 7/2 or 8/1.  Moist color is 10YR 6/1, 6/2 or 7/2.  It is sandy loam with 10 to 20 percent clay.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 6/6, 7/6; 7.5YR 5/6 or 6/6.  Moist color is 10YR 4/6, 5/6, 6/6; 7.5YR 4/6 or 5/6.  It is clay loam, clay or gravelly clay.  Clay content ranges from 27 to 60 percent.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 20 percent.  Base saturation (sum) ranges from 25 to 45 percent, and is less than 35 percent in the lower part of the horizon. Reaction is very strongly or strongly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Iversen soils are on ridgetops and upper sideslopes of coastal hills and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 600 to 1300 feet.  The soils formed in material weathered from sandstone and shale.  The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A moderate marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range in temperature.  The Iversen soils are associated with a ridge system in Southern Mendocino County that was subjected to intensive clearing, burning and subsequent erosion in the late 1800's and in the early part of this century.  It is probable that the Iversen soils represent a truncated version of the original deeper forest soils.  They have been relatively undisturbed for 40 to 60 years now and are reforming A horizons.  Mean annual precipitation is 45 to 55 inches. Mean January temperature is about 50 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 58 degrees F. and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 250 to 320 days."

Fishrock soils are less than 20 inches deep to lithic contact.  Havensneck soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section.  Ferncreek and Quinliven soils are on marine terraces adjacent to the ridge system on which Iversen soils formed.  Ferncreek and Quinliven soils are greater than 60 inches deep and have udic soil moisture regimes."
