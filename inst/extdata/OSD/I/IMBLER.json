These soils are usually moist, but are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 8 to 24 inches following the summer solstice. Depth to contrasting textures is more than 40 inches. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 36 inches thick. The soil has less than 30 percent medium and coarser sand in the particle size control section.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe AC horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam. In some pedons, this is a B horizon.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist. It is loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam."

Central Point soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 52 to 56 degrees F., have a hard or very hard B horizon and have more than 30 percent medium and coarser sand in the particle size control section. Edmundston soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches, have mean annual soil temperature at 52 to 59 degrees F., and are dry from about June to November. Oak Glen soils commonly are gravelly, slightly acid or medium acid, and have a mean annual soil temperature of about 54 to 59 degrees F. Ritter soils dominantly are loam in the 10 to 40 inch control section and are mildly alkaline in the lower part of the B horizon.  Stevens soils are gravelly and hard in the lower part of the control section, are mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline and are calcareous at a depth of 25 to 40 inches. Uhlig soils have a silt loam or loam A horizon and a loam B horizon with the upper part loess and ash."

The soils formed in eolian material weathered mainly from basalt and andesite. The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 24 inches. The mean annual temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F. The average January temperature is 31 degrees F. The average summer temperature is 65 to 69 degrees F. The frost free period is 120 to 160 days."
