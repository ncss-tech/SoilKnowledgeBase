  "OVERVIEW": "The Ironsprings series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on alluvial fans and hillslopes.  They formed in alluvium, residuum, and colluvium derived from sandstone.  Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent. Mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 14 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F.  The moisture control section is moist in some or all parts for at least 30 consecutive days immediately following May 1 in most years.  It is dry in all parts for at least 45 consecutive days immediately following July 1 in most years.  The soil is noncalcareous to 60 inches or more.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the profile.  They are predominantly pebbles less than 1/4 inch in diameter.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Texture is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Texture is coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  When sands are coarse and massive they have an arkosic influence."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This series is established as a cool season precipitation counterpart to the Cruckton series.  The Cruckton series occurs on the east slope of the continental divide and receives the majority of its precipitation in the months of May through August with the most precipitation occurring in July.  The Ironsprings series occurs on the western slope of the continental divide and receives the majority of its precipitation in the months of September through May with the least amount of precipitation received in July.  Approximately 50 percent of the precipitation comes as snow.  Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to approximately 14 inches (A horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 14 inches to 40 inches (BA, Bt1, Bt2 horizons).  Last updated by the state 12/90.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
