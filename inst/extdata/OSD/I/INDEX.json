Rock fragments, including hard cinders in the particle-size control section, average from 35 to 70 percent by volume.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F.  Depth to the lithologic discontinuity is 14 to 25 inches.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 moist and 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 0 through 2 moist or dry.  Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid.  There is tonguing of this horizon into the Bhs horizon in some pedons.\nThe Bhs horizon has value of 3 through 5 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist or dry.  Structure grades from weak to strong.  Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 5YR.  Hues of 10YR to 5YR have value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  Where present, the hues of 2.5Y have value of 6 to 8 moist, 7 or 8 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is ashy sand or ashy loamy sand with 30 to 60 percent rock fragments in the lower part.  The fine-earth fraction is more than 60 percent volcanic ash and pumice.  Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist or dry.  The texture of the fine-earth fraction is loamy sand or sand.  Coarse fragments range from 40 to 60 percent by volume.  The structure ranges from massive, exhibiting some rock structure, to a moderate expression of subangular blocky structure.  Reaction is moderately acid to strongly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 6 or 7 moist and dry, and chroma of 4 moist and dry.  Coarse fragments range from 50 to 70 percent by volume.  The horizon is massive exhibiting some rock structure.  Some pedons have weak, fine subangular blocky structure.  Coarse fragments are residual rock fragments.  Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe bedrock is granitic rock, or low grade metamorphic rock such as slate or phyllite."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Index soils are on mountain slopes at elevations of 2,200 to 3,600 feet. The lower limit of the elevation range is on northerly and easterly exposures and in cold air drainages.  Slopes range from 8 to 90 percent.  Index soils formed in a thin mantle of volcanic ash over residuum and colluvium from granitic and low grade metamorphic rocks.  The climate is maritime influenced with cold, wet winters, and cool, moist summers.  The mean January temperature is about 27 degrees F; the mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F; mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is 75 to 110 inches, with a considerable portion of this being in the form of snow.  Frost-free season is 110 to 130 days."

Kindy, Klapatche, Nagrom and Marblemount soils are all 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  The Marblemount and Teneriffe soils are frigid.  Nagrom and Playco soils are loamy-skeletal.  Reggad soils lack a spodic horizon and are fragmental."

These soils meet chemical requirements for a spodic horizon.  The particle-size class was updated to ashy-skeletal over sandy or sandy-skeletal on 8/2007 due to addition of this class in the 10th edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
