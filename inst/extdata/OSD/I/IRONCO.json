  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil was reclassified from a Typic Argiborolls to an Aridic Argiborolls in October 1994 based on 12 to 16 inch precipitation and upland range sites.  Classification was changed to superactive, frigid Aridic Argiustolls 12/98.  The pedon used to establish the series in the Moffat County Area, Colorado soil survey is typic ustic and is excluded from the current Ironco concept.  Any previous pedons correlated to the Ironco series in northeastern Utah or northwestern Colorado no longer fit the current Ironco concept.\nThe diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 11 to 31 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 11 inches (A and BA horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 11 to 60 inches (Bt horizons).\nTaxonomic version:  Eighth Edition, 1998.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
