  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Content of rock fragments, by volume, range from 10 to 35 percent in the surface and from 15 to 35 percent in the subsoil.  Further, subhorizons in some pedons contain up to 45 percent of rock fragments.  The rock fragments are of igneous and metamorphic origin with granites being a major component.  Typically, gravel-size fragments are dominant, but cobble and boulder size fragments are significant.  Stones and boulders within and on the soil range from 0 to 3 percent.  In the solum, the average content of sand ranges from 35 to 65 percent and of clay from 4 to 18 percent.  The fine earth fraction typically is sandy loam or fine sandy loam, but coarse sandy loam, loam, and silt loam are in some pedons.  The solum ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have an A horizon 1 to 4 inches thick.  It has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nSome pedons have a thin Bs horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.\nThe bedrock is primarily granite or gabbro, but is metamorphic in some places."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Barto and Hawksnest soils in the same family and the closely related Mesaba soils.  The Barto soils lack an E horizon, typically have redder hue and bedrock is dominated by basalt.  Hawksnest soils formed in till derived from sedimentary rock and typically are more acid.  In addition, the rock fragments are of mostly sandstone, siltstone or shale.  Mesaba soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils typically are on bedrock controlled ground moraines with plane to slightly convex slopes.  Slope gradients are mainly 2 to 18 percent but range from 0 to to 35 percent.  They formed in a 10 to 20 inch thick mantle of loamy glacial till of the Late Wisconsinan glaciation over bedrock that is dominantly granite, gabbro, and metamorphic.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 35 to 44 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 27 to 40 inches, but is dominantly 27 to 30 inches."

Conic soils are 20 to 40 inches deep and are on midslopes, Quetico soils are less than 10 inches deep and are on ridges and Newfound soils are greater than 40 inches deep and are on footslopes or concave midslopes."
