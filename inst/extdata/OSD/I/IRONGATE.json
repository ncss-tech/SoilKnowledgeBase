The Botetourt soils are on low terraces and second bottoms, and have an argillic horizon. The Berks, Carbo, and Dekalb soils are well drained, shallower to bedrock, and are on uplands. Derroc soils are loamy-skeletal and are well-drained. The Frederick and Shottower soils are well drained, have redder more clayey subsoils, and are on uplands. The Wolfgap soils do not have redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less within 30 inches of the mineral soil surface; in addition they are fine-loamy."

Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately rapid in the substratum. In undisturbed areas the depth to an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 16 to 30 inches for two to four weeks following heavy rains or snow melt during the winter months."
