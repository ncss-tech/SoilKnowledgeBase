  "STATES": "HI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Iilewa series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in basic volcanic ash over pumice. Iilewa soils are on volcanic cones and lava fields along the lower east rift zone of Kilauea volcano. Slopes range from 2 to 80 percent. The mean annual rainfall is about 2300 millimeters (91 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F).",
