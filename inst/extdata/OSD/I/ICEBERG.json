  "OVERVIEW": "The Iceberg series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone. Iceberg soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 8 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F.",
