  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Solum thickness ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  Depth to the 2C material ranges from 18 to 39 inches.  Rock fragments are mostly gravel and cobbles and range from 0 to 30 percent in the upper part of the profile, and 0 to 5 percent in the 2C horizon.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand in the fine earth fraction.\nSome pedons have an E horizon that has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand or fine sand in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family. The Eldridge and Enstrom series are in similar families.  Eldridge soils have a mesic temperature regime.  Enstrom soils are from outside of Region R.  They have a superactive cec activity class and receive less than 32 inches of annual precipitation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Irasburg soils are on lake plains and stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits underlain by loamy glaciolacustrine deposits.  These deposits are of Wisconsin age and are derived mainly from phyllite or schist.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 48 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost free season ranges from 100 to 145 days."

Adams and Croghan soils are on nearby stream terraces and are sandy throughout.  Lamoine and Nicholville are adjacent to Irasburg soils and are finer textured in the solum."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  1.  The classification is revised with this update.  The former  classification was Sandy over loamy, mixed, frigid Typic Haplorthods.\n2. The Irasburg series replaces some soils formerly mapped as Eldridge Variant.\n3. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the layer from 0 to 8 inches.  (Ap horizon)\nb.  Aquic feature - redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less at 22 inches. (C horizon)\nc.  Strongly contrasting particle size class - the transition between the sandy material and the loamy material in the control section (10 to 40 inches) is less than 5 inches and the loamy material has less than 50 percent fine or coarser sand.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
