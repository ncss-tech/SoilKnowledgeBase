  "OVERVIEW": "The Ipasha series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and till derived from metasedimentary rock.  Ipasha soils are commonly found along drainageways on moraines. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1,150 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.5 degrees C.",
