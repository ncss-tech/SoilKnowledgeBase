  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Insak soils are on coralline-mangrove and swamp-forest plant communities, in brackish waters of mangrove swamps, salt marshes, and tidal marshes adjacent to shorelines of atolls and karst islands. Slope is 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in water-deposited coralline sand and organic matter.  Elevation is -1 to 4 meters (-3.3 to 13 feet.) The soils are flooded daily with ocean salt water during periods of high tide; 20 cm above (8 in) to 20 cm (8 in) below the surface. Areas closer to the ocean are submerged longer than areas closer to land. The climate is tropical and moist. Because of the strong marine influence, the diurnal and annual range of temperature is limited. Rainfall averages about 3685 millimeters (145 inches) per year and ranges from approximately 2900 to 4400 mm (114 to 173 in.) The seasonal wet (May to November) and dry seasons (December to April) with the driest months (February, March, and April) averaging 178 to 229 mm (7 to 9 in) per month. Rainfall is derived from convective uplift, which results in short duration rainstorms of high intensity. Rainfall is irregularly distributed geographically. These soils lie within the latitudinal zone that receives more solar radiation than it re-radiates back to space. This imbalance maintains the atmospheric temperatures in a quasi-steady state. The mean daily temperature throughout the year averages 27 C (81 F) with a mean diurnal range of about 4 C (7 F.) Relative humidity averages about 90 percent at night and 75 to 80 percent during the day."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chia, Ngedebus, Majuro, and Odesangel soils. Chia soils are organic to 75 centimeters and over coralline sand.  Ngedebus and Majuro soils are very deep somewhat excessively drained soils generally adjacent to coastal beaches. These soils formed in water and wind-deposited coral rubble and/or sand. Ngedebus soils are typically found on lagoon sides of island whereas Majuro soils are typically found on oceansides of islands and have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the subsoil. Odesangel soils formed in depressional areas that retain fresh or brackish water. The soils are derived dominantly from decomposed and partially decomposed freshwater marsh vegetation overlying coral sand."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. Negligible runoff, high saturated hydraulic conductivity. The soils are flooded very frequently for extremely brief periods, semi-diurnally, by high tides that fluctuate between about 20 centimeters (8 inches) above and 20 centimeters (8 inches) below the soil surface. The soils are ponded frequently for very long periods all months of the year."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are in limestone mangrove and swamp forest plant communities and are used for sediment catchment and some timber harvest for local use. The mangroves trap about 30% of sediments in Palau and other coralline islands from entering the coral reefs; it is an important buffer protecting the reefs from excessive sedimentation or eutrophication. Eutrophication will lead to coral reef degradation and stimulate algae growth on corals.  These algae communities vigorously strip excess nutrients from the water as they grow much faster than the corals. As the algae blooms get much larger, they trap more sediment in the reefs and ultimately causing coral bleaching.  As the old algae decay, they consume the oxygen in the water; the low oxygen then will kill off fish, crabs, shrimp, and the living reef devastating tourism and fishing in these local island economies.\nMangrove forests are located adjacent to the sea and are affected by the semi-diurnal tidal cycle. The remaining areas of mangrove forest are located inland behind coastal strands, which were probably once open to the sea. Mangrove forests are generally closed-canopied with only a single to few mangrove species of Rhizophora spp., Sonneratia spp. Lumnitzera spp., Xylocarpus spp., and Bruguiera spp. These trees are of medium-size (less than 3 m in height), and less than 8 cm dbh.\nThe moderate tree sizes and density of trees within the mangrove forest ecological type result in stands containing a relatively high biomass. The species are adapted to reproducing and surviving on the deep soils inundated with brackish seawater. Although the bottomland soils contain large quantities of organic material, the woody biomass above and below ground serves as an important reservoir of nutrients. The mangrove plant communities are efficient in cycling plant nutrients."

The source of plant nutrients is the biocycling of organic matter. The limestone bedrock is typically porous and fractured, allowing roots to penetrate into the rock.
