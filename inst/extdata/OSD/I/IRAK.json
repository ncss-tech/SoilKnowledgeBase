  "OVERVIEW": "The Irak series consists of very deep, moderately well or somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from reworked eolian material. Irak soils are in drainageways and draws on low terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 355 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
