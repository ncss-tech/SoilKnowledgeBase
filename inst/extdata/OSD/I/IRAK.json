  "OVERVIEW": "The Irak series consists of very deep, moderately well or somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from reworked eolian material.  Irak soils are in drainageways and draws.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
