The moisture control section is moist, in most years, in some or all parts for 90 or more consecutive days when the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.  The soil is at or above 41 degrees F. for 75 to 100 consecutive days.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 15 inches.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 75 percent.  Depth to the lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The particle size control section has 12 to 25 percent clay, 28 to 45 percent silt, and 30 to 52 percent sand with 15 to 35 percent coarser than very fine sand.Reaction is mildy alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nA cambic horizon is in some pedons and has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3."

The mean annual temperature ranges from 36 degrees to 44 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches with about equal amounts received throughout the year.  Elevation ranges from 8,200 to 8,600 feet.  The frost free season is about 60 to 75 days."
