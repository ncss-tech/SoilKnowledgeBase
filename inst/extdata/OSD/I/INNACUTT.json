Cameo soils have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y and have an ochric epipedon.  Clarkelen, Glenberg, and Kornman soils are moist in some part of the soil moisture control section in late spring and early summer.  In addition, Kornman soils have A horizons which have been abnormally enriched by nitrogen and phosphorus.  Colorow soils have water tables which fluctuate between depths of 4 and 8 feet, and have oxidized iron colored redox features at depths between 40 and 60 inches.  Radnik soils have mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 58 degrees and do not have significant amounts of mica in the silt and sand fractions.  Redbank soils have C horizons with hues of 10R to 5YR and do not have significant amounts of mica in the silt and sand fractions. The Tapicito soils have fewer than 5 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."

They formed in alluvium derived from Tertiary micaceous sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, and fanglomerate.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 7,100 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."
