  "OVERVIEW": "The Iao series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium weathered from basic igneous rock.  Iao soils are on valley  floors and alluvial fans. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 838 millimeters (33 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 24 degrees C. (75 degrees F.).",
