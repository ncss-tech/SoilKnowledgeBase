Large areas with adequate water management are used for citrus, truck crops, pastureland, and range.\nPotential native vegetation consists of longleaf and slash pine with an undergrowth of sawpalmetto, gallberry, waxmyrtle and pineland threeawn. In depressions, water tolerant plants such as cypress, loblollybay gorodonia, red maple, sweetbay, maidencane, blue maidencane, chalky bluestem, sand cordgrass and bluejoint panicum are more common."
