Neso soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 59 to 62 degrees F. In addition, Neso soils are in the Pecos-Canadian Plains and Valleys (MLRA 70) and are more moist in May and June. Orrubo soils have Cr horizons below the hardpan at depths between 17 and 30 inches. Ferrogold and Philder soils have petrocalcic horizons from 14 to 20 inches. Sutherland soils have mean annual precipitation of 12 to 16 inches. Tencee soils are drier in the control section for longer periods (typic/aridic). Wodovar soils have rock fragments that are mostly lime nodules and formed in lacustrine sediments."
