  "OVERVIEW": "The Infantry series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon.  They are well drained soils that are moderately rapidly permeable above and below a very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon.  They formed in stratified alluvium derived from limestone and modified by eolian sands.  These nearly level to strongly sloping soils are on erosion remnants on fan piedmonts.   Slope ranges from 3 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

Orrubo soils have Cr horizons below the hardpan at depths between 17 and 30 inches. Ferrogold and Philder soils have petrocalcic horizons from 14 to 20 inches. Sutherland soils have mean annual precipitation of 12 to 16 inches. Tencee soils are drier in the control section for longer periods (typic/aridic). Wodovar soils have rock fragments that are mostly lime nodules and formed in lacustrine sediments."
