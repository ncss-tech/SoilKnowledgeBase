  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Depth to the 2Bt horizon commonly ranges from about 24 to 40 inches but is as deep as 45 inches in some pedons.  Fragments of chert 0.25 to 3 inches across range from 16 to 25 percent in A and E horizons, from 16 to 35 percent in the Bt horizon, and from 16 to 50 percent in the 2Bt horizon.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid, except  the surface layer is less acid where limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. In some cultivated pedons the A and E horizons have been mixed to form an Ap horizon, 4 to 10 inches thick, that has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. The fine earth fraction is silt loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The fine earth fraction is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 6 to 8. The fine earth fraction is silt loam or silty clay loam. The clay content is commonly about 30 percent but ranges from 25 to 35 percent.  The sand content is less than 20 percent and the silt content is more than 45 percent. In most pedons, near the base of the Bt horizon, there are peds or pockets that exhibits some brittleness in up to 40 percent of the horizon. The brittle areas are commonly yellowish brown, light yellowish brown, or pale brown.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 6 or 8, or it is mottled in shades of brown and red.  The fine earth fraction is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, or clay.  Clay content is commonly about 40 percent but ranges from 35 to 50 percent."

Addielou, Bama, Orangeburg, and Ruston soils do not have coarse fragments and have more than 15 percent fine and coarser sand in the argillic horizon.   Allen, Leesburg, Minvale, Nella and Pikeville soils do not have lithologic discontinuities within the solum.  Avilla, Etowah and Holston soils formed in loamy allivium or colluvium and do not have lithologic discontinuities within the solum.  Noboco, Octavia and Warnock soils have seasonal high water tables within 60 inches of the soil surface."

The slope gradient commonly ranges from 5 to 12 percent but the complete range is 5 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in a silty mantle 2 to 3 feet thick containing fragments of chert, and including rounded gravel from marine deposits, and in the underlying residuum from cherty limestone."
