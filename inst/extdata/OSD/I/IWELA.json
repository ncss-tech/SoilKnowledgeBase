Bigbow soils have buried paleosol horizons.  Carri, Celavar, Celacy, Evpark, Nyjack and Ribera soils have a lithic or paralithic contact within 40 inch depths. Dermala soils have igneous or metamorphic parent material. Lykorly soils have annual soil temperature of 54 to 56 degrees F.  The Arwite, Bigbow, Dalhart, Deekay, Elwop, Fort Collins, Gateson, Oldwolf, Olnest, Rauzi, Rockybutte, Stoneham, Toluca, and Wagonhound soils are in LRR-E or LRR-G soils and are more moist in May and June."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Iwela soils are on footslopes and backslopes of stable landslides. They formed in colluvium derived from Tertiary sandstone and Cretaceous shale. Slopes are 10 to 40 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,800 to 7,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches with about half falling as winter snow and half falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."
