Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent in the A or surface horizons and from 15 to 35 percent in the upper B horizons to 35 to 55 percent in the lower B and control section.  A concentration of stone size coarse fragments was found at a depth between 16 and 33 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches varies from 48 to 52 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 4 and 15 inches is moist in all parts for 45 to 135 consecutive days between December 1 and April 30.  It is dry in all parts for 45 to 90 consecutive days between June 15 and October 15 in most years.  Base saturation ranges from 50 to 85 percent in the soil with less than 75 percent in some part of the upper B1t or B2t horizons.  The base saturation commonly increases with depth.   Ca/mg ratios range from 1 to 0.02.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4; 5YR 5/4, 4/6, 5/6, 6/6; 2.5YR 3/4, 4/4.   Moist color is 7.5YR 3/2, 4/4; 5YR 5/4, 4/4, 3/4, 3/3; 2.5YR 3/4, 3/6, 4/6.
