    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact with ultramafic rock is typically 40 to 50 inches but may be as much as 60 inches.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent in the A or surface horizons and from 15 to 35 percent in the upper B horizons to 35 to 55 percent in the lower B and control section.  A concentration of stone size coarse fragments was found at a depth between 16 and 33 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches varies from 48 to 52 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 4 and 15 inches is moist in all parts for 45 to 135 consecutive days between December 1 and April 30.  It is dry in all parts for 45 to 90 consecutive days between June 15 and October 15 in most years.  Base saturation ranges from 50 to 85 percent in the soil with less than 75 percent in some part of the upper B1t or B2t horizons.  The base saturation commonly increases with depth.   Ca/mg ratios range from 1 to 0.02.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4; 5YR 5/4, 4/6, 5/6, 6/6; 2.5YR 3/4, 4/4.   Moist color is 7.5YR 3/2, 4/4; 5YR 5/4, 4/4, 3/4, 3/3; 2.5YR 3/4, 3/6, 4/6.  They are slightly acid to neutral.\nThe B2t horizons are 5YR 6/6, 5/6, 4/6, 5/4, 4/4, 3/4; 2.5YR 6/6, 5/6, 4/4, 3/6, 3/4.  Moist color is 5YR 4/4, 3/4, 3/3; 2.5YR 3/4.  It is gravelly, very gravelly and very stony clays with weak to moderate subangular blocky structure and are slightly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons lack C horizons."

The upper elevations usually occur on southern aspects.  The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 50 to 100 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 35 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F., and mean annual temperature varies from 52 to 59 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 140 to 220 days."

Josephine soils are fine-loamy and have a base saturation of less than 35 percent.  Hugo and Josephine soils have developed from sedimentary or metamorphosed sedimentary rock materials and generally produce a higher volume of timber products."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  It is assumed that more than 40 percent by weight of the whole soil less than 2mm in diameter is serpentine minerals.  (Lab. analyses shows 53.8 percent sand and silt size particles between the depths of 20 and 40cm and 57.8 percent between 40 and 70cm).  This is a change in classification from fine, serpentinitic, mesic Ultic Haploxeralfs to clayey-skeletal, serpentinitic mesic Ultic Haploxeralfs.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon was sampled for characterization; and analyses were run by the National Soil Survey Laboratory in Lincoln, Nebraska.  (Field sample numbers 76CA-023-1-1 through 8*.  Laboratory sample numbers 78P2537 - 2544, April 1979).\nOSED scanned by SSQA.
