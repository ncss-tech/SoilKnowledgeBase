  "OVERVIEW": "The Ironmound series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone, or sandstone interbedded with siltstone or shale, of Permian age. These soils are on crests and side slopes of low hills in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 1 to 40 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 16.1 degrees C (61 degrees F), mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 in).",
