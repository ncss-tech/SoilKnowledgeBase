  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to calcareous material normally ranges from 14 to 40 inches, but may be deeper than 40 inches.  Thickness of the dark colored A horizon ranges from 3 to 7 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F.  It is estimated that the soil is moist in some part of the moisture control section for about 50 to 70 days when the soil temperature at 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or above.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It has up to 10 percent scattered rock fragments on the surface which are mainly pebbles.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 7 dry and moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture is typically clay loam, clay, or silty clay loam, but clay may range from 35 to 50 percent.  This horizon is commonly noncalcareous, but some pedons are calcareous in the lower part.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C or Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8, 5 through 8 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is typically a loam, silt loam, clay loam, silty clay, sandy clay, or gravelly clay.  Some thin strata of up to 15 percent pebbles occur.  This horizon has greater than 15 percent carbonates throughout, with subhorizons exceeding 40 percent carbonates.  The calcic horizon averages 20 to 40 percent calcium carbonate.  Reaction ranges from moderate to strongly alkaline."

Acel soils have cracks wider than 1 cm. at 20 inches.  Burnac soils have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches, 15 to 30 percent rock fragments in the surface, and 35 to 55 percent in the substratum.  Dandrea and Echolake soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches, and Dandrea soils have gravelly Bt horizons.  Loghill and Siesta soils lack calcic horizons and are noncalcareous throughout.  Silesca soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Spud soils lack carbonates above 40 inches.  Bario soils have lower silt content and C horizons with 15 percent or more gravel."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Iles soils are on undulating mountain ridge tops, benches, toe slopes,  and side slopes.  Slopes ranges from 2 to 25 percent.  They formed in residuum weathered from sandstone and shale with some intermixed aeolian materials.  The area is characterized by long, cold winters and short, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches and is evenly distributed throughout the year.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 75 to 100 days.  At the type location, elevation is about 6,400 feet and ranges to 7,200 feet.  In Utah, elevation ranges from 7,500 to 8,200 feet in more southerly latitudes."
