    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the surface and subsurface and moderately acid to moderately alkaline in all other horizons.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2.  Texture is muck.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand, fine sand, mucky sand, or mucky fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, gray, yellow, or red range from few to common.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, gray, or olive range from few to many.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, consists of shell fragments or marl ranging from about 4 to 8 inches thick between the Btg horizon and fractured limestone bedrock.  Colors and textures are variable."

In addition, Boca soils are moderately deep limestone bedrock while Felda soils are very deep.  The poorly drained Ft.

They formed in loamy marine sediments over limestone bedrock.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 55 inches, and the average annual air temperature ranges from 72 to 74 degrees F."

The very poorly drained Estero are on similar positions, are very deep, always have mucky surfaces, and are Spodosols.  The very poorly drained Kesson soils are in tidal areas, are very deep, and are sandy throughout.  The very poorly drained Peckish soils are on similar positions, are very deep, have weakly expressed spodic horizons, and are sandy throughout.  Wabasso soils are on slightly higher positions, are deep or very deep to limestone bedrock, and are Spodosols.\nThe very poorly drained Wulfert soils are in tidal areas, are very deep, and are Histosols."

The natural vegetation is dominated by red mangrove, black mangrove, cabbage palm, water oak, cypress, pickerelweed, maidencane, fern, melaleuca, popash, batis, and sea purslane."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic features and horizons in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon:  the zone from 5 to 39 inches (A and E horizons).\nArenic feature:  the zone from 0 to 39 inches (Oa, A, and E horizons).\nDepth to limestone bedrock:  at a depth of 47 inches (R horizon).\nUnder natural conditions, the tidal areas are flooded during normal daily high tides.  Depressions are ponded for about 3 to 6 months or more in most years.  In most years, in sloughs, the water table is within depths of 10 inches of the surface for 1 to 3 months and between 10 and 40 inches for about 9 months.  During periods of high rainfall, the soil in the slough is covered by a slowly moving layer of shallow water for periods of about 1 to 7 days or more.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
