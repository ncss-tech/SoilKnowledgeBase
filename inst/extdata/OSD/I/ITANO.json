Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 356 to 406 millimeters (14 to 16 inches).  Mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C (60 to 61 degrees F), average January temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F), the average July temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F), and the frost-free period is 260 to 280 days."

Columbia soils have less than 18 percent clay in the 25 to 100 centimeter (10 to 40 inch) control section.  Dello soils are sandy.  Kingile soils have continuous clayey mineral layers at 41 to 91 centimeters (16 to 36 inches) below a histic epipedon.  Peltier soils have a mollic epipedon and a fine control section.  Rindge soils have continuous sapric organic materials to a depth of 130 centimeters (51 inches) or more.  Valdez soils are nonacid."

The water table is at depths of 3 to 4.5 feet during the growing season.  The soils are subject to rare flooding.  Some areas are flooded during the early part of the winter for control of weeds, salt reduction and for the creation of waterfowl habitat."
