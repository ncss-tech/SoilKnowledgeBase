Baldknob soils are 25 to 50 cm to a lithic contact and are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of glacially scoured foothills and mountains. Kiehl soils have a sandy-skeletal control section and are on glacial outwash terraces and terrace escarpments. Nevine soils are ashy over loamy-skeletal and are on moraines, foothills, and mountains. Scoap soils have a mollic epipedon 50 to 75 cm thick and are on uplands and mountainsides. Thout soils are 50 to 100 cm to a lithic contact and are on glaciated mountainsides and ridgetops."

The layer from 23 to 53 cm (2Bw2) is mixed and is assumed not to meet andic soil properties\nCambic horizon - the zone from 10 to 53 cm (Bw1, 2Bw2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 25 to 100 cm (part of 2Bw2, 2C1, part of 2C2 horizons)\nAdditional information: The modal concept of this series regarding depth class is greater than 150 cm to bedrock. The Cashmere Mountain Areas, Washington (WA608) soil survey recognized the Inkler series as 100 to 150 cm to lithic bedrock. Upon update of this survey, consideration should be given in correlation of this soil series concept to another series or propose a new series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
