  "OVERVIEW": "The Islandpark series consists of very deep well drained soils occurring on caldera floors and dissected tablelands.  These soils formed in mixed loess and volcanic ash over residuum from basalt.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  Islandpark soils have moderate permeability.  Average annual precipitation is about 24 inches. Average annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
