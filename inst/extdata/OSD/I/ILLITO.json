    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Stones cover 15 to 50 percent of the surface.  Depth to a lithic contact ranges from 5 to 10 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 60 degrees F to 66 degrees F.  The soil temperature is below 47 degrees F from January 1 to March 1.  The soil at the lithic contact is moist from November 1 to May 1 and is dry the rest of the year.  The mollic epipedon extends into the Bt horizon and is the same thickness as the solum.  Organic matter is 1 to 2 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.  Rock fragments (gravel, cobbles, and stones) range from 35 to 60 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 5/4; 10YR 4/3 or 5/3.  Moist colors are 7.5YR 3/2; 10YR 2/2 or 3/2.  Clay content ranges from 20 to 27 percent.\nThe Bt horizon is 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4 or 5/4 dry and 7.5YR 3/2 moist.  It is very stony clay loam, very stony clay or very cobbly clay with 35 to 45 percent clay content.  This horizon rests abruptly on hard, unweathered basic volcanic rock."

Quinto soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 10 to 20 inches and have have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the texture control section. Shorthorn, Tunis and Tunehill soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 10 to 20 inches and have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the texture control section.

    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly mapped as Rough stony land in the Los Banos Area, series 1939 report.  pH determined by colorimetric method using Hellige Troug triplex indicators.  Texture determined by hydrometer method.  Organic carbon determined by Walkley-Black digestion method.  Base saturation determined by KC1-triethanolamine extract (sum of cations).  These soils are classified in the loamy-skeletal family because the texture control section averages less than 35 percent clay content.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in February of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
