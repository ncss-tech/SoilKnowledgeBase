Added additional competing series\n12/2010 GLP Added MLRA to opening paragraph, updated parent material and landform, converted English measurements to metric, added percent sand and clay to horizon and range in characteristics, and added lab sample numbers to horizon descriptions. Changed texture classes and reaction classes to match lab data. Extended the depth of the type location to 200 centimeters using the original description that went down to 200 centimeters in which we added a 3BC horizon that was described. In the Range in Characteristics, added soil moisture, mean annual soil temperature, particle size clay and sand percents, Added Btk and 2Bt, 2Btk horizon data to the Range in Characteristics. Added clay and sand percents in the RIC horizon data and added rock fragments and calcium carbonate equivalent where needed. Updated competing series section. Updated Geographic settings section. Updated Geographically Associated Soils section.\nUpdated Drainage and Permeability section to Drainage and Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity.\nUpdated Distribution and Extent section. Added additional data for typical pedon.\n4/2017 BKN Updated parent material. Added on a northwest-facing, convex, 3 percent slope backslope in rangeland at an elevation of 408 meters (1338 feet) to typical pedon. Added redox features to horizon descriptions for 2Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons. Added depth to redox features to RIC and remarks. Added SAR range to RIC. Added Konza as a geographically associated soil.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy: Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nData for typical pedon is from Kansas State University Characterization Laboratory, Manhattan, Kansas; pedon samples 2480-2487 (88KS061004).
