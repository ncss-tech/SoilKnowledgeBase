  "OVERVIEW": "The Indiera series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on side slopes of mountains in the Humid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  They formed in iron-rich residuum that weathered from serpentinite bedrock.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 70 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 79 inches.  Slopes range from 20 to 60 percent.",

Texture is clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10R to 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, has no dominant color and is multicolored in shades of red, brown and yellow.  Texture is clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr layer is composed of hard fractured and slightly weathered serpentinite.

Aljibe (T) soils are on similar positions but are shallow to serpentinite bedrock. Guama (T) soils are on similar positions but do not have a paralithic or lithic contact within 80 inches. Indiera soil is in a perudic soil moisture regime."

A soil moisture and soil temperature study performed in the San German Area Soil Survey Update recognized the Perudic Soil Moisture Regime in Puerto Rico, recognized the isothermic soil temperature regime at 750 meters above sea level (in Perudic Soil Moisture Regime) and 900 meters above sea level (in Udic Soil Moisture Regime) and adjusted the isothermic-isohyperthermic line.\nIndiera soils are in MLRA 270."
