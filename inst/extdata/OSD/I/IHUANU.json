These soils are on all hillslope positions of hilly `a`a flows that are 1,500 to 3,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 10 to 20 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash and cinders over `a`a lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 1020 to 1270 millimeters (40 to 50 inches), which is generally evenly distributed throughout the year. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1270 to 1780 millimeters (50 to 70 inches). The mean annual temperature ranges 12 to 14 degrees C (53 to 57 degrees F). The mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Soil moisture - usually moist, but dry in some or all parts for short intermittent periods totaling 90 or more days (Ustic moisture regime).\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n--Mollic epipedon - from 0 to 50 centimeters (0 to 20 inches) (A/2C1 and 2C2/Bw horizons).\n--Andic soil properties - from 0 to 56 centimeters (0 to 22 inches) (A/2C1, 2C2/Bw, and 2C3 horizons).\n--Lithic contact - at 56 centimeters (22 inches) (2R horizon).\nEditlog: 2/5/08 Andic texture modifiers added to horizon texture. MRK\nComment on horizonation: The aa lava flowed and then a nearby cinder cone erupted. At first it was a cindery ash fall and then eventually finer ash on top which can happen during an eruption episode. The aa lava fragments and the aa bluerock are from a single depositional event and the larger to finer particle ash fall is one as well. There were only 2 depositional events here.
