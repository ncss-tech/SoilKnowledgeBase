  "OVERVIEW": "The Ihuanu series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in basic volcanic ash and cinders in `a`a lava. Slopes range from 10 to 20 percent. The mean annual rainfall is about 1140 millimeters (45 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",

These soils are on all hillslope positions of hilly `a`a flows that are 1,500 to 3,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 10 to 20 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash and cinders over `a`a lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 1020 to 1270 millimeters (40 to 50 inches), which is generally evenly distributed throughout the year. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1270 to 1780 millimeters (50 to 70 inches). The mean annual temperature ranges 12 to 14 degrees C (53 to 57 degrees F). The mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."

MRK\nComment on horizonation: The aa lava flowed and then a nearby cinder cone erupted. At first it was a cindery ash fall and then eventually finer ash on top which can happen during an eruption episode. The aa lava fragments and the aa bluerock are from a single depositional event and the larger to finer particle ash fall is one as well. There were only 2 depositional events here.
