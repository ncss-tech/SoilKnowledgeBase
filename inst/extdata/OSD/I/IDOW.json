Arbidge soils have duripans less than 10 inches thick, and are underlain by sand and gravel.  Dacker soils have silty Bt horizons.  Ditchcamp and Rakane soils lack a Bk horizon.  Deerlodge and Exel soils have hues redder than 10YR.  Ditchcamp, Snowmore and Wendell soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Drysel soils have a massive duripan.  Exel and Wellsed soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizons, and have a duripan less than 10 inches thick.  Hager soils have duripans that are 3 to 10 inches thick.  Lembos soils are slightly to strongly effervescent in the Bt horizon.  Ochoco soils have up to 20 percent pumice in the A and Bt horizons and have a duripan less than 10 inches thick.  Waco soils have an E horizon."
