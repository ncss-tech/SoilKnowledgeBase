  "OVERVIEW": "The Idow series consists of a moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Idow soils are on basalt plains, buttes, and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
