  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Rock fragments mainly sandstone, range from 2 to 25 percent by volume in the surface layer and from 5 to 35 percent in the subsoil and substratum. Unless limed, reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid throughout.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nUndisturbed A horizons have value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate granular. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bw horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture is mainly fine sandy loam or loam, and less commonly sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe BC horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak subangular blocky or platy. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Pockets of loamy sand or loamy fine sand are also within the range. Structure is weak or moderate platy or it is massive. Consistence is friable or firm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Barto, Hawksnest, Insula, Irona, Westminster, and Woodstock series in the same family. The Barto soils are dominated by rock fragments of granite and typically have redder hue in the subsoil. Hawksnest soils are in a higher effective precipitation area and have a higher moisture content in the subsoil during the growing season. Hawksnest soils are also typically more acid throughout. Insula soils have rock fragments dominated by granite and typically have more rock fragments in the subsoil. Westminster soils have rock fragments that are primarily schist, gneiss, or granite, and also are in a higher rainfall area. Woodstock soils contain rock fragments that are mainly schist and gneiss."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Irona soils are nearly level to strongly sloping soils on till uplands. They are typically on bedrock-controlled ridges, benches and convex hillsides. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent with small linear moderately steep to very steep areas. The till material is derived from sandstone and some granite. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 36 inches, mean annual air temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F, and mean frost-free season ranges from 90 to 140 days. Elevation ranges from 200 to 1800 feet above sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chazy, Colosse, Conic, Peasleeville, Schroon, Sunapee, and Topknot soils. The Topknot soils are the somewhat poorly drained component in the drainage sequence. The well drained Conic and somewhat poorly drained Chazy soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. The Peasleeville soils occur in nearby very deep, smooth, broad till plains. Schroon and Sunapee soils occur on adjacent very deep till landscapes where slopes are more convex or undulating. Colosse soils are more cobbly and gravelly forming linear water-worked ridges."
