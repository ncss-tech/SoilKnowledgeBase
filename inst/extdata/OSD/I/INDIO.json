    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Indio soils are on lacustrine basins, alluvial fans and floodplains at elevations ranging from about 1400 feet above sea level to 230 feet below sea level.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent except for a few low banks next to stream channels.  The soils formed in young calcareous, silty mixed alluvium.  The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 10 inches.  Summer storms are infrequent, erratic, and may be violent, and winter rains are infrequent and gentle.  The average January temperature is about 50 degrees F., the average July temperature is about 90 degrees F., the mean annual air temperature is about 70 to 74 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 240 to 365 days."

In other areas, the present vegetation is shadscale, bursage, arrowweed, and other plants.  Such areas provide ephemeral grazing in unusually wet years."
