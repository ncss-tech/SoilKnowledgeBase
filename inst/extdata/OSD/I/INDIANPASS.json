  "OVERVIEW": "The Indianpass series consists of moderately deep to fractured hard bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks on glaciated mountain slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 80 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 90 inches and average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
