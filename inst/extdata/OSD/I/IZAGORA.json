  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness exceeds 60 inches.  A few flakes of mica and few to common soft black bodies are in the Bt and BC horizons in most pedons.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  The E horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture of the A and E horizons is very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or loam. Reaction of the A and E horizons ranges from moderately acid to extremely acid.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Gray, brown, and red mottles range from few to common below a depth of about 18 inches.  Texture is loam, clay loam, or rarely silt loam or silty clay loam.  The lower part of Bt horizon and the BC horizon has the same colors as above and in addition, may have hue of 5Y with chroma of 0 to 2 or is neutral. It is mottled in shades of yellow, gray, brown, and red, with gray color increasing with depth.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay or clay. Clay content of the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon ranges from 18 to 30 percent, averaging about 22 percent; the clay content of the lower Bt horizons ranges from 35 to 50 percent, averaging about 40 percent.  Silt content is more than 30 percent throughout the solum.  The Bt horizon ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid."

Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent but are dominantly 1 to 3 percent.  The soil formed in marine or fluvial deposits that range in texture from loams to clays.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is 65 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 53 inches."
