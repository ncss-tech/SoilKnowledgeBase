  "OVERVIEW": "The Idee series consists of somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvial sediments or mixed alluvial and loess deposits over loamy Arkansas River alluvium. These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping natural levees or low terraces. Slopes are dominantly 0 to 2 percent, but range up to 5 percent.",

The 2Bt horizon ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Iron depletions are in shades of gray, and iron accumulations are in shades of yellow, or brown. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2. Iron depletions are in shades of gray, and iron accumulations are in shades of yellow, and brown. Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.

Acy soils have black or very dark gray coatings on faces of peds in the upper Bt horizon. Dundee soils have thinner solum and lack IIB2t horizons. Essen, Galvez, and Patoutville soils have neutral or alkaline lower B horizons. Hebert and McGehee soils have B2t horizons with hue of 5YR. Hebert soils also have silt coats on faces of peds and McGehee soils have silty clay B3 and C horizons."
