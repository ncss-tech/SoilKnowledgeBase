The A and B horizons range from slightly acid to very strongly acid, except for surface horizons that have been limed. The 2Bt horizon ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Iron depletions are in shades of gray, and iron accumulations are in shades of yellow, or brown. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2. Iron depletions are in shades of gray, and iron accumulations are in shades of yellow, and brown. Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Iron depletions are in shades of gray, and iron accumulations are in shades of yellow, or brown. Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam."

Acy soils have black or very dark gray coatings on faces of peds in the upper Bt horizon. Dundee soils have thinner solum and lack IIB2t horizons. Essen, Galvez, and Patoutville soils have neutral or alkaline lower B horizons. Hebert and McGehee soils have B2t horizons with hue of 5YR. Hebert soils also have silt coats on faces of peds and McGehee soils have silty clay B3 and C horizons."

This soil formed in loamy alluvial sediments or mixed alluvial and loess deposits over loamy alluvial sediments. Near the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 51 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F."

Dexter soils are at higher elevations, are better drained and have higher chroma Bt horizons. Goodwill soils are at slightly higher elevations and have Bt horizons that are dominantly 3 to 6 chroma. Forestdale, Perry, and Portland soils are at lower elevations and have clayey control sections."

Series also was assigned to an active activity class based on lab data for the type location pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
