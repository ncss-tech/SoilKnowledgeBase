Depth to a dense clayey layer with more than 40 percent clay ranges from 12 to about 20 inches.  Black concretions or nodules from 2 to 10 mm in diameter range from none to few throughout the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam or loam.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Yellowish, grayish or brownish mottles range from few to many.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, or loam.  It ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bt2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2.  Mottles in shades of red or brown range from few to many.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  It is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe lower Bt horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 with or without mottles in shades of brown or yellow.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Acadia series is the only competing series.  However, closely similar soils include Alusa, Derly, Lightning, Lufkin, Mabank, Midland, Springfield, Wilson and Wrightsville series.  The Acadia soils have a solum less than 60 inches thick and are more acid throughout.  The Alusa, Mabank and Springfield soils have an abrupt texture change between the A and Bt horizons, and Springfield soils have mixed clay mineralogy.  Derly and Wrightsville soils have tonguing of A material into the Bt horizon.  The Midland and Lightning soils lack mottles in the upper Bt horizon and have mixed clay mineralogy.  The Lufkin and Wilson soils have vertic properties."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ivanhoe soils typically are on the fourth or fifth terrace level of the Red River.  The slope gradient ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in clayey alluvium.  The mean annual temperature is 64 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches.  The summer moisture deficit is about 4 to 6 inches.  The annual P-E index ranges from 64 to 72."

The Hicota soils occupy mounds and have coarse-loamy control sections.  These soils are on nearby better drained positions.  The Porum soils are more sloping and are typically along sideslopes of drains.  They have red silty clay loam Bt horizons.  The Woodtell soils are more sloping and are on low ridges or along sideslopes of drains.  They have red clayey Bt horizons underlain with interbedded shales and loamy materials."
