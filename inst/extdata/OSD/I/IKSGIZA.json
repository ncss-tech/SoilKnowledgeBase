  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is less than 32 degrees F.  The mat of organic material consists of partially decomposed moss and roots 6 to 16 inches thick.  Depth to permafrost ranges from 15 to 40 inches below the soil surface.  Thickness of the silty mantle and depth to the contrasting sand material is 10 to 40 inches.  The control section contains substantial mica.  Reaction is very strongly or strongly acid in the organic mat and strongly acid to neutral in the lower horizons.\nThe A horizon, when present, has hue from 5YR to 10YR; value moist of 2 or 3; and chroma moist from 1 to 3.  Texture is mucky silt loam or silt loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue from 10YR to 5Y; value moist from 3 to 5; and chroma moist from 1 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam, and may include lenses of fine sandy loam.\nThe C or Cf horizon, when present, has hue from 10YR to 5Y; value moist from 3 to 5; and chroma moist from 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam, and may include lenses of fine sandy loam.  Thin ice lenses are usually present.\nThe 2Cf horizon has hue from 2.5Y to 5Y; value moist from 3 to 6; and chroma moist from 2 to 4.  Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or loamy sand."

Deborah and Saulich soils have less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the control section.  Kuslina soils lack micaceous influence.  Mendeltna soils have greater than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Tolsona soils have no strata and lack micaceous influence.  Umiat soils have weathered bedrock within the control section."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Iksgiza soils formed in a thick organic mat over silty loess that is underlain by eolian sand.  Iksgiza soils are on nearly level to steep concave areas on dune mantled alluvial plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The climate is subartic continental with long, cold winters and short, warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and includes mean annual snowfall of about 60 inches."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Runoff is ponded to medium.    Permeability is moderate above the permafrost.  Altered drainage occurs where the insulating organic layer is destroyed by fire or mechanical clearing.  Loss of the organic mat results in lowering of the permafros\nlevel with subsequent lowering of the water table.  The texture an corresponding permeability of the thawed underlying material is highly variable."
