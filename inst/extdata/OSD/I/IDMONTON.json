  "OVERVIEW": "The Idmonton series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in mixed alluvium with loess influence.  Idmonton soils are on fan remnants, stream terraces and flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 4.4 degrees C.",
