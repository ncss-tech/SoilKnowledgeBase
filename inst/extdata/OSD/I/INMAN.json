(Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)\nAp--0 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) flaggy silty clay loam; moderate medium granular structure; friable; many fine roots; 15 percent fragments of limestone up to 1 inch thick and 8 inches long; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Thin fragments of rock 1 inch to 15 inches long ranges from 10 to 35 percent by volume in each horizon.  The reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral, except thin layers near bedrock range to mildly alkaline.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons have a thin A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The fine earth fraction of the A horizon is dominantly silty clay loam or silt loam, and includes clay in severely eroded pedons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The fine earth fraction is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam with 35 to 55 percent clay.  Mottles in shades of brown and yellow range from few to many in most pedons.  The Bw horizon is dominantly a cambic horizon, but part of each pedon has some evidence of clay illuviation.  In the lower part of most pedons there are a few streaks or coatings of gray that are inherited from the parent rock.\nThe B part of the Cr/B horizon has colors and textures like the Bw horizon, except it is mottled without a dominant matrix color in many pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Inman is the only series in this family.  Soils in similar families are the Colbert, Dandridge, Eden, Hampshire, Mimosa, and Needmore series.  All of these soils except Dandridge have continuous argillic horizons.  Colbert, Eden, Hampshire, and Mimosa soils are more than 40 inches deep over bedrock.  Dandridge soils are less than 20 inches deep to bedrock.  Needmore soils have a mesic temperature regime and are free of flagstones."

Near the type location, the mean annual air temperature is 60 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 52 inches."
