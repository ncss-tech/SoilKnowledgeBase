    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to a paralithic contact with dense glacial till is 20 to 40 inches.  These soils are usually moist but are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  Mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 45 to 47 degrees F.  Depth of influence of volcanic ash ranges from 8 to 14 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 or 5 moist and dry. It is loam or sandy loam with 6 to 15 percent clay.  Rock content averages from 40 to 60 percent.\nThe 2Cd horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is dense glacial till that breaks to very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly loam.  Clay content is 5 to 12 percent.  Rock fragments average from 40 to 60 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

These soils formed in glacial till with a surface mixture of volcanic ash.  The average annual precipitation is 65 to 80 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 43 to 44 degrees F.  Average January temperature is about 33 degrees F., and average July temperature is about 61 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 120 to 150 days."
