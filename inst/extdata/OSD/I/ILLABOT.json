  "OVERVIEW": "The Illabot series consists of moderately deep moderately well drained soils formed in glacial till and volcanic ash.  These soils are on glacially modified mountain sides and have slopes of 3 to 65 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is about 75 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to a paralithic contact with dense glacial till is 20 to 40 inches.  These soils are usually moist but are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  Mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 45 to 47 degrees F.  Depth of influence of volcanic ash ranges from 8 to 14 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 or 5 moist and dry. It is loam or sandy loam with 6 to 15 percent clay.  Rock content averages from 40 to 60 percent.\nThe 2Cd horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is dense glacial till that breaks to very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly loam.  Clay content is 5 to 12 percent.  Rock fragments average from 40 to 60 percent."
