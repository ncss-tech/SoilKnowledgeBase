  "OVERVIEW": "The Irma series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from schist or phyllite rock types.  Irma soils are on broad ridgetops of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
