  "OVERVIEW": "The Ireland series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum from limestone, dolomite, and sandstone that have been influenced by loess. Ireland soils are found on slopes of 8 to 70 percent on mountain slopes, hillslopes, and ridges. The mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C., and the mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm.",
