  "OVERVIEW": "The Ipsoot series consists of moderately deep to cinders, excessively drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over basaltic cinders. The Ipsoot soils are on cinder cones. Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches.",

The ash mantle has field estimated clay content of 0 to 5 percent. The upper part of the particle-size control section contains 20 to 35 percent pumice paragravel fragments and the lower part contains 90 percent or more gravel and cobble size basaltic cinders. Reaction is neutral throughout.\nThe A and AC horizons have value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry. Chroma is 2 through 4 moist and dry.

Soil material less than 0.5 millimeters in size has mollic colors and material greater than or equal to 0.5 millimeters in size has high values and high chroma.\nAndic soil properties - from a depth of 1 to 18 inches (A and AC horizons). Data for andic soil properties are from S87OR-035-001 (Steiger Series).\nParticle-size control section - The upper part (1 to 31 inches) averages 27 percent pumice paragravel fragments and the lower part (31 to 41 inches) contains over 90 percent gravel and cobble size basaltic cinders.\nAsh deposit is from Mt.
