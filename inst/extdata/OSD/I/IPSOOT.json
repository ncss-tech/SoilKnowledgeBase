    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F and the mean summer soil temperature without an O horizon is 52 to 59 degrees F. These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 90 consecutive days within the four months that follow the summer solstice. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Depth to basaltic cinders is 20 to 40 inches. Thickness of the zone having andic soil properties is 14 to 25 inches. The upper part (ash mantle) of the particle-size control section contains 70 to 100 percent glass and glass-coated aggregates, phosphate retention of 25 to 50 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron of 0.4 to 0.9 percent, 15 bar water content of 4 to 7 percent on both dried and undried samples and moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 grams per cubic centimeter. The ash mantle has field estimated clay content of 0 to 5 percent. The upper part of the particle-size control section contains 20 to 35 percent pumice paragravel fragments and the lower part contains 90 percent or more gravel and cobble size basaltic cinders. Reaction is neutral throughout.\nThe A and AC horizons have value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry. Chroma is 2 through 4 moist and dry. It contains 35 to 50 percent pumice paragravel and 40 to 70 percent sand-size (0.5 - 2.0 mm.) ash.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 through 8 moist, 6 through 8 dry and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and dry. It is ashy coarse sand, paragravelly ashy coarse sand, very paragravelly ashy coarse sand and very paragravelly ashy loamy coarse sand. It contains 5 to 45 percent pumice paragravel. It contains 60 to 90 percent sand-size (0.5 - 2.0 mm.) ash.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR and 7.5YR. It has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 through 7 dry, with chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It contains 90 to 100 percent gravel and cobble size cinders of which 50 to 90 percent are gravel size and 10 to 50 percent are cobble size."

Color is strongly contrasting within the fine earth fraction. Soil material less than 0.5 millimeters in size has mollic colors and material greater than or equal to 0.5 millimeters in size has high values and high chroma.\nAndic soil properties - from a depth of 1 to 18 inches (A and AC horizons). Data for andic soil properties are from S87OR-035-001 (Steiger Series).\nParticle-size control section - The upper part (1 to 31 inches) averages 27 percent pumice paragravel fragments and the lower part (31 to 41 inches) contains over 90 percent gravel and cobble size basaltic cinders.\nAsh deposit is from Mt. Mazama.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
