  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Free carbonates are below depths of 60 inches. The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches thick. The series control section typically contains less than 5\npercent by volume gravel of mixed lithology, but some pedons have as much as 10 percent, mostly in strata. The gravel is mostly less than 5mm in size, and in distinct strata or dispersed throughout the profile. The series control section typically is dominated by medium and coarse sand averaging 15 percent or more coarser than 0.42 mm. (No. 40 sieve).\nSome pedons have an O horizon up to 4 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, with value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand. The AB horizon is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand or sand. The A horizon in some pedons contains sufficient organic matter to be classed as having a mucky modifier. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, 10YR, or is neutral, with value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or less. It is sand, coarse sand, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand. It ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sand or coarse sand. Typically it is moderately acid to neutral."

Isanti and Garborg\nsoils have 85 percent sand or mone passing the no. 40 size sieve and center on fine sands in the control section. Hangaard soils contain 10 to 35 percent, by volume of rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Medano soils have calcareous sediments throughout the profile."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Isan soils are on plane or concave positions in level to undulating outwash plains, stream terraces, flood plains, and valley trains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Isan\nsoils formed in sandy outwash sediments frome the Des Moines Lobe of Late Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual air temperature is 37 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 22 to 34 inches. Frost-free days range from 90 to 145. Elevation above sea level ranges from 700 to 1600 feet."

This soil has season high saturation at a depth of 0.5 foot during April to June in years of normal precipitation in the poorly drained phase and at the surface on the very poorly drained phase.  Ponding may also occur on the very poorly drained phase."

Type location moved from Hennepin County, Mn. to Sherburne County, Mn., 11/96 to better exemplify the series concept within the MLRA\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
