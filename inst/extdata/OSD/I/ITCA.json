    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ateron, Camool, Harlow, Jackrock, Vennob, and Wallsburg series.\nAteron soils do not have prismatic structure in the Bt2 horizon and an abrupt boundary between the A and Bt horizon.  Camool soils have mollic epipedons that include the entire argillic horizon and have more than 3 percent organic matter in the A horizons.  Chen and Harlow soils have mollic colors throughout the Bt horizon and also do not have prismatic structure in the argillic horizon.  Jackrock soils are less than 10 cm to the argillic horizon. Vennob soils do have abrupt boundaries between the A and Bt horizons.  Wallsburg soils do not have prismatic structure in the argillic horizon and contain rock fragments that are dominantly sandstone and limestone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Itca soils are on hills, mountains, and plateaus. They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Slopes are 2 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 1,556 to 2,590 meters in Nevada. They range as low as 1,410 meters in Idaho on north aspects and 1,524 meters in Oregon. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 460 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."
