  "OVERVIEW": "The Irvington series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils on uplands and interstream divides of the Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area (MLRA 133A).  They formed in loamy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 67 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 67 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.",

The well drained Bama and Lucedale soils are on adjacent higher positions, lack plinthite and have redder subsoils.  The well drained Benndale soils are on higher positions, have less than 5 percent plinthite in the subsoil and have coarse-loamy control sections. The somewhat poorly drained Escambia and Robertsdale soils are on lower positions. In addition, Escambia soils have coarse-loamy subsoils.  The moderately well and well drained Malbis and Poarch soils are on higher positions and lack fragic qualities. In addition, Poarch soils have coarse-loamy control sections. Saucier soils are on similar positions but lack fragic qualities."
