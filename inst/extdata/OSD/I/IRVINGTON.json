The poorly drained Atmore and Grady soils are on lower adjacent positions.  In addition, Atmore soils have coarse-loamy control sections and Grady soils have clayey control sections and lack plinthite. The well drained Bama and Lucedale soils are on adjacent higher positions, lack plinthite and have redder subsoils.  The well drained Benndale soils are on higher positions, have less than 5 percent plinthite in the subsoil and have coarse-loamy control sections. The somewhat poorly drained Escambia and Robertsdale soils are on lower positions. In addition, Escambia soils have coarse-loamy subsoils.  The moderately well and well drained Malbis and Poarch soils are on higher positions and lack fragic qualities. In addition, Poarch soils have coarse-loamy control sections. Saucier soils are on similar positions but lack fragic qualities."
