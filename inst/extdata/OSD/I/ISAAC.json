  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum varies from 18 to 33 inches and depth to hard rock ranges from 20 to 72 inches plus.  Thickness of the underlying saprolite ranges from 10 to 60 inches.  Reaction of the profile ranges from medium acid to neutral (pH 5.5 to 7.3).\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture ranges from clay loam to gravelly clay loam with the amount of gravel ranging from 5 to 50 percent of the soil mass.\nThe Bt horizon is dominantly clay and has colors with values of 3 or 4, chromas of 4 to 8 in hues of 5YR or 2.5YR.  Structure ranges from weak medium to moderate coarse, subangular blocky.  Strong vertical cleavage and pressure faces are evident when soil is dry."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Coamo and Parasol series, all in the same subgroup and family.  The Coamo soils are browner (hues of 10YR and 7.5YR) and have calcic horizons within 40 inches of the surface and in addiiton have stratified gravelly underlying horizons. The Parasol soils are yellower (hues of 10YR), more friable and in addition are underlain by highly weathered and fractured intrusive rocks."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils occur on moderately sloping to moderately steep topography on side slopes and foot slopes of dissected volcanic uplands with slope gradients of 5 to 40 percent.  The regolith consists of partially weathered basic extrusive volcanic rocks.  The climate is semi-arid tropical with annual precipitation ranging from 35 to 55 inches and mean annual temperature ranging from 78 to 80 degrees F."

The present definition in Soil Taxonomy does not adequately define Udic-ustic soil moisture regimes for the tropics.  The previous OSED date was 6/65.\nThe Isaac soils were mapped as Descalabrado in the 1932 Reconnaissance soil survey.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nMollic epipedon - zone from 0 to 11 inches (Ap and AB horizon)\nArgillic horizon - zone from 11 to 24 inches (Bt horizons)\nLithic contact - zone at 24 inches (R layer)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
