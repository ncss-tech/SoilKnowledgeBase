  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  The histic epipedon ranges from 8 to 15 inches in thickness and includes part of the E horizon in some pedons. The thickness of the solum ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  The depth to the compact till layer ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  The rock fragment content in the particle size control section ranges from 40 to 60 percent and is dominantly gravel size.  Reaction throughout the mineral layers is medium to very strongly acid.  Coarse fragments are predominantly fine gravel in all horizons.  The average summer soil temperature at the compact till surface is about 46 degrees F.\nColors in the Oe horizon range in hue from 5YR to 10YR with moist values of 2 or 3, and moist chromas from 0 to 2.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value moist ranges from 3 to 6; and the chroma moist is 2 or 3.  The texture is commonly silt loam or mucky silt loam, but ranges to include sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content is less than 35 percent and is dominantly gravel size.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue from 10YR through 5YR; value moist from 2 through 4; and chroma moist from 0 through 2. Texture is commonly sandy loam but ranges to include very fine sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 40 to 60 percent and is dominantly gravel.\nThe Bsm layer has hue from 2.5Y to 2.5YR, value moist of 2 or 2.5, and chroma moist of 0 or 1.  The horizon is indurated with extremely firm consistence.\nThe Bs layer has hue from 2.5YR through 10R, value moist of 3 or 4, and chroma moist from 4 through 6.\nThe Cd horizon has hue ranging from 2.5Y through 10YR; value moist from 3 through 5; and chroma moist from 2 through 4.  Mottles have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value moist of 4 or 5, and chroma moist from 2 through 8.   Coarse fragment content ranges from 50 to 80 percent and is dominantly gravel size."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Isidor soils are on moraines, drumlins, and hillslopes.  The parent material is glacial till of mixed mineralogy.  The climate is humid maritime with mean annual precipitation of 120 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 degrees F., and the average summer air temperature is 55 degrees F.  The slope gradient is commonly 25 to 35 percent but ranges from 0 to 40 percent.  Elevation ranges from 100 to 400 feet."

Kaikli, Kina, and Maybeso soils are organic soils in depressional areas.  Mitkof and Wadleigh soils lack a placic horizon and are on hillslopes.  St. Nicholas soils have a lithic contact within 20 inches of the surface and are on hillslopes."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  The Isidor soils are used for wildlife habitat, recreation, watershed protection, and timber production.  The overstory vegetation consists mainly of Alaska yellow cedar and lodgepole pine, with some western red cedar, western hemlock, and mountain hemlock included.  The understory vegetation is dominantly Alaska yellow cedar, blueberries, mountain hemlock, and rusty menziesia.  The ground cover is mainly salal, skunk cabbage, deer fern, bunchberry dogwood, and feather moss."
