    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Impedimenta soils are on pediments, hills and mountain backslopes. Slopes range from 4 to 60 percent. These soils formed in dominantly granitoid residuum. Elevations range from 510 to 840 meters (1,673 to 2,755 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."

Blackeagle soils are characterized by a cambic horizon, have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section and have a lithic contact between 36 and 50 centimeters. Marbolite soils have an argillic horizon. Dalelake and Pintobasin soils are very deep and are formed in eolian and alluvial materials, respectively."
