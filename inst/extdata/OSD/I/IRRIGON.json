  "OVERVIEW": "The Irrigon series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium weathered from basaltic and quartzitic rocks. Irrigon soils are on uplands and terraces and have slopes of 2 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are dry in all parts more than half the time (cumulative) that the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F., but are moist during the winter and are moist in some part between depths of 8 to 24 inches for more than 1/4 of the time (cumulative) that the soil temperature is 41 degrees F. or higher at a depth of 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 54 to 56 degrees F. Depth to a paralithic contact or semiconsolidated tuffaceous sandstone is 20 to 40 inches. The ochric epipedon has less than one percent organic matter in the upper 7 inches when mixed.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe B2 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist. It is fine sandy loam or loam and has less than 18 percent clay, 0 to 5 percent pebbles, and 0 to 5 percent cobbles. Few to common black stains are on fracture surfaces of the semiconsolidated sandstone. Fractures are 4 to 6 inches apart."

Adkins, Chedahap, Clems, Crestline, Haybourne, Kecko, Rebel, Royal, Sagehill and Scooteney soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock or semiconsolidated sediments. Also, Adkins, Chedahap, Crestline, Kecko, Rebel, Royal, Sagehill and Scooteney soils are calcareous above depth of 43 inches. Deschutes soils have 20 to 60 percent pumice and are 20 to 40 inches deep tl a lithic contact. Prosser soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches, have textures of very fine sandy loam and silt loam and are calcareous in some part.  Vinging soils are very stony and are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Wiehl soils have secondary lime above semiconsolidated silty lacustrine sediments."

The soils formed in moderately coarse and medium textured alluvium weathered from basaltic and quartzitic materials. The climate is semiarid with an average annual precipitation of 7 to 8 inches; hot dry summers, cool moist winters with mean annual temperature of to 54 degrees F.; mean winter temperature is 34 degrees to 36 degrees F.; and the mean summer temperature is 71 to 73 degrees F.
