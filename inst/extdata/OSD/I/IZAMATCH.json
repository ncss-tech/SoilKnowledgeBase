  "OVERVIEW": "The Izamatch series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in re-worked alluvium derived from mixed rocks influenced by calcareous loess.  Izamatch soils are on beach plains, fan skirts, and dissected lake plains.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",

Gynelle soils are dry in the lower part of the moisture control section throughout the year in most years and have calcium carbonate equivalent of less than 20 percent.  Inmo and Itme soils are dominated by fine gravel (2 to 5 mm diameter).  Ioka and Leo soils lack carbonate coats on rock fragments.  Izo soils have thin stratification throughout the profile and are subject to occasional flooding.  Nepalto soils have hue of 5YR.  Wardenot soils have silica coats in the Bqk horizon.  Willwood soils are not moist for 10 to 20 days during the summer and have a mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 10 degrees C."
