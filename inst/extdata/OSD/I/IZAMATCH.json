Gynelle soils are dry in the lower part of the moisture control section throughout the year in most years and have calcium carbonate equivalent of less than 20 percent.  Inmo and Itme soils are dominated by fine gravel (2 to 5 mm diameter).  Ioka and Leo soils lack carbonate coats on rock fragments.  Izo soils have thin stratification throughout the profile and are subject to occasional flooding.  Nepalto soils have hue of 5YR.  Wardenot soils have silica coats in the Bqk horizon.  Willwood soils are not moist for 10 to 20 days during the summer and have a mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 10 degrees C."

Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,280 to 1,895 meters. The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 130 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 130 to 170 days."
