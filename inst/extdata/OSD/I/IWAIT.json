  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are typically effervescent to the surface, but may be leached to 6 inches in some pedons.  The particle-size control section has 20 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent fine and coarser sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent gravel. The moisture control section is usually moist in some or all parts in March through June. The average annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, clay loam or fine sandy loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nA thin Bw horizon or AC horizon occurs in some pedons.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 to 6  moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  Textues of sandy clay loam or fine sandy loam can occur where the soil is underlain by sandstone.  The horizon has 5 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 10 percent but is typically less than 5 percent.   Electrical conductivity is 0 to 4 millimhos per centimeter.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nA C horizon occurs below or in place of the Bk horizon in some pedons."

Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  Elevations are 3,500 to 5,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 19 inches, half of which falls as rain or snow from March through June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."
