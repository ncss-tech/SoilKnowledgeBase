  "OVERVIEW": "The Illahee series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountain side slopes.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from welded tuffs and flow basalts.  Slopes are 3 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 70 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Rock fragments are of basaltic and welded tuff lithology.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and 2 or 3 dry.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.  Organic matter is 5 to 9 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 6 moist and 3 or 4 dry.
