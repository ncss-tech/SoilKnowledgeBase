The soil is usually moist and is dry between 4 and 12 inches for less than 45 consecutive days during the summer.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.  Rock fragments are of basaltic and welded tuff lithology.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and 2 or 3 dry.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.  Organic matter is 5 to 9 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 6 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It is very gravelly loam, very cobbly loam, or extremely gravely loam with 15 to 25 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 30 to 55 percent gravel and 5 to 20 percent cobbles.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid."
