    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated depths in the following paragraph are measured from the mineral surface.)  The depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments are composed of granite, schists, slates, and quartzite. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent and cobbles range from 0 to 10 percent by volume throughout the pedon.  Total rock fragments percentage is less than 15 percent in the solum.\nThe O horizon has a hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or is neutral, has a value of 2 or 2.5, and a chroma of 0 or 1.\nThe A horizon, not in all pedons, has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bs1 horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 4.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bs2 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe BC horizon, not in all pedons, has a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand. Reaction  ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon, not in all pedons, has hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand or the gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures.  Thin lenses of fine sandy loam occur above the bedrock in some pedons.  Reaction of the C horizon ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2R horizon includes granite, schist, slate, basalt, and quartzite."

East Lake, Hartwick, Karlin, Kiva, Missisquoi, Pence, Rousseau, Rubicon, Sayner, and Vilas soils do not have a lithic contact within a depth of 40 inches.  Deerton soils have rock fragments that are composed of sandstone and are underlain by sandstone at 20 to 40 inches. Duel soils are have rock fragments composed of limestone and are underlain by limestone at 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Ishpeming soils are on bedrock controlled moraines.  They formed in 20 to 40 inches of glaciofluvial deposits and sandy till overlying igneous and metamorphic bedrock on ground moraines, end moraines, outwash plains and stream terraces.  Slopes range from about 0 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 38 inches. The mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 43 degrees F.  The frost free period is 90 to 130 days."
