  "STATES": "MI,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ishpeming series consists of moderately deep somewhat excessively drained soils formed in 20 to 40 inches of glaciofluvial and sandy till overlying igneous and metamorphic bedrock on ground moraines, end moraines, outwash plains and stream terraces.  Permeability is rapid in the sandy mineral material and extremely slow in the bedrock.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Rock fragments are composed of granite, schists, slates, and quartzite. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent and cobbles range from 0 to 10 percent by volume throughout the pedon.  Total rock fragments percentage is less than 15 percent in the solum.\nThe O horizon has a hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or is neutral, has a value of 2 or 2.5, and a chroma of 0 or 1.\nThe A horizon, not in all pedons, has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bs1 horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 4.

It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe BC horizon, not in all pedons, has a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand. Reaction  ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon, not in all pedons, has hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand or the gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures.  Thin lenses of fine sandy loam occur above the bedrock in some pedons.  Reaction of the C horizon ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2R horizon includes granite, schist, slate, basalt, and quartzite."

East Lake, Hartwick, Karlin, Kiva, Missisquoi, Pence, Rousseau, Rubicon, Sayner, and Vilas soils do not have a lithic contact within a depth of 40 inches.  Deerton soils have rock fragments that are composed of sandstone and are underlain by sandstone at 20 to 40 inches. Duel soils are have rock fragments composed of limestone and are underlain by limestone at 20 to 40 inches."
