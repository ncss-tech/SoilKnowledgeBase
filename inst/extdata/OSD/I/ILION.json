  "OVERVIEW": "The Ilion series consists of deep or very deep, poorly drained soils formed in till which is strongly influenced by calcareous black shale or limestone and grayish shale. They are nearly level or gently sloping soils in depressions in upland till plains. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow above the subsoil and slow or very slow in the lower subsoil and substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 38 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 40 inches. Depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 60 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 inches to more than 8 feet and may be either ripable or hard. Rock fragment, mainly shale content by volume ranges from 0 to 20 percent in the surface and upper part of the subsoil and 10 to 35 percent in the lower part of the subsoil and C horizon and includes up to 3 percent greater than 3 inches in diameter in the solum and 3 to 8 percent greater than 3 inches in diameter in the C horizon. Rock fragments greater than 10 inches in diameter cover 0 to 20 percent of the surface. Unless limed, reaction ranges from moderately acid through neutral in the Ap and E horizons, moderately acid through slightly alkaline in the Bt horizons, and slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline in the BC and C horizons. Free carbonates may be present in the lower part of the solum and are usually found in the C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. It has weak or moderate, fine or medium granular or fine subangular blocky structure and friable to firm consistence.\nThe Eg horizon, where present, is neutral, or has hue of 10YR through 5Y or neutral, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2 and it contains redoximorphic features. It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. The horizon is massive or has very weak or weak platy, angular or subangular blocky structure and friable to firm consistence.\nThe Btg horizon is neutral, or has hue of 10YR through 5Y or neutral, value of 3 through 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is clay loam or light silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction containing an average of 28 to 35 percent clay. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse, subangular blocky or strong coarse prismatic parting to blocky. It commonly has redoximorphic accumulations and/or depletions.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon containing free carbonates, with colors and textures similar to the B and C horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 3. Some pedons have chroma of 3 below 30 inches. In some pedons the C horizon has redoximorphic features, in others they are lacking. It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. It is massive or has thick or thin plate-like divisions. Some pedons lack free carbonates in the upper part, but typically the horizon is calcareous.\nSome pedons may have a 2R below 40 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Lantz, Olmsted, Orio and Varick series are members of the same family. Lantz soils formed in colluvium derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks. Olmsted soils formed in water sorted materials and have stratified lower B and C horizons. Orio soils have a higher content of sand in the control section and occur on depressional parts of stream terraces and outwash plains. Varick soils have shale bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.\nKanona, Lakemont, Madalin and Romulus series are similar soils in related families. Kanona, Lakemont and Madalin soils have greater than 35 percent clay content in the control section. Romulus soils have an average clay content from 18 to 35 percent in the control section and have colors of 7.5YR or redder in the B and C horizons."

Also associated are the Alden, Fremont, Hornell, and Sun soils. Alden and Sun soils are very poorly drained and occur in the wettest parts of the landscape. Fremont soils are somewhat poorly drained and are distinctly more acid. Hornell soils are finer textured, more acid, and have shale bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Previously, the RIC of the Eg allowed for a B1g, or what would now probably be a Bg, to be present above the Bt. This needs to be investigated during the MLRA update process. This could impact classification. Further investigation indicates that pedons with a B1g horizon are of minor extent and will be considered to be an inclusion within the Ilion series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this profile are:\n1. ochric epipedon - 0 to 14 inches. (Ap).\n2. albic horizon - 9 to 14 inches. (E)\n3. argillic horizon - 14 to 33 inches. (Bt1 and Bt2)\n4. aquic conditions - 9 to 60 inches. (E, Bt1, Bt2, and C)\n5. mollic subgroup - has colors of mollic epipedon, but is too thin, only 9 inches. (Ap)"
