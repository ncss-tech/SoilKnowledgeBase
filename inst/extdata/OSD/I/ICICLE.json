These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 50 to 75 percent rock fragments and 5 to 10 percent clay in the fine earth fraction.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3 when moist and dry.  It is stony fine sandy loam, bouldery sandy loam, over very bouldery sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe B horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  Texture is extremely stony sandy loam, very stony sandy loam, extremely cobbly sandy loam, or very cobbly sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and dry.  Texture is extremely stony sandy loam, very stony sandy loam, extremely cobbly sandy loam, extremely stony coarse sandy loam, or very cobbly coarse sandy loam."

Althouse and Minaloosa soils are loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction throughout the particle-size control section.  In addition, Althouse soils are dry for 45 to 60 days in the moisture control section.  Ardtoo soils are 15 to 45 percent rock fragments in the B horizon.  Jayar, Kamela, and Umpa soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Ohop soils are strongly acid or medium acid throughout and are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days.  Smokey soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Standup soils have 10 to 15 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Treble soils have a C horizon that is firm or very firm and somewhat brittle in the lower part of the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Icicle soils are on mountain sides.  Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium from granitic rocks mixed with loess and volcanic ash.  Most areas have been glaciated but little evidence of till is in the profile.  Elevations are 1,500 to 5,000 feet.  These soils are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters with a snowpack from December through March.  The average annual precipitation is 28 to 50 inches.  The average January temperature is about 24 degrees F, average July temperature is about 67 degrees F, and the average annual air temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F is 140 to 170 days."
