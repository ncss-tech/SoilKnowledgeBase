  "OVERVIEW": "The Iceslew series consists of deep, poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived dominantly from sandstone and siltstone.  These soils are on flood plains and valley sideslopes.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 65 degrees F.  A fluctuating water table ranges from 6 to 30 inches throughout most of the year, except in March through June when it is ponded.  The particle size control section averages loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam with 18 to 27 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent pebbles throughout the entire soil.  Mottles of 7.5YR or 5YR can occur below 4 inches, and mottles of 2.5Y or 5Y hue range in depth from 10 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 8 dry, 3 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  Reaction is mildly alkaline through strongly alkaline.  Electrical conductivity ranges from 2 to 8 mmhos.\nThe C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam.  It is stratified with finer textures in the lower part in some pedons.  Reaction is mildly alkaline through strongly alkaline.  EC ranges from 2 to 8 mmhos.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 8 dry, 3 through 7 moist, and chroma is 1 through 4 dry and moist.  Mottles of olive, gray, and brown range from few to many, faint to prominent, and fine to large.  Textures are very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  Typically, EC is more than 4 mmhos but ranges from 2 to 8 mmhos.  Reaction is mildly alkaline through strongly alkaline."

The soil formed in loamy sediments derived dominantly from light colored, interbedded sandstone, siltstone, and shale.  Seeps are numerous at the type location.  The average annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches with peak period occurring in spring and early summer.  The mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
