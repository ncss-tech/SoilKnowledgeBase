Gynelle and Izo soils have mostly gravel larger than 13 millimeters in diameter. Gynelle soils also have Bk horizons. Ioka soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 9 degrees C.  Itme and Izamatch soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section for 10 to 20 days (cumulative) between July and October. Leo soils have strata of sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the control section and have gravel that range up to about 50 millimeters in diameter. Nepalto soils are not stratified and have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR. Wardenot soils contain silica coatings and pendants on rock fragments in a Cqk horizon and have a strata of fine sandy loam in the control section. Willwood soils have mean annual soil temperature of 9 to 10 degrees C, have less than 50 percent coarse and very coarse sands, and are not moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October."

They formed in alluvium derived from granitic, volcanic, and metamorphic rocks. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,190 to 1,650 meters. The climate is cool-arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 110 to 150 days."
