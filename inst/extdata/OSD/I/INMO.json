  "OVERVIEW": "The Inmo series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitic, volcanic, and metamorphic rocks. Inmo soils are on alluvial fans, inset fans, fan skirts, fan piedmonts, beach plains, and in drainageways. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",

Gynelle and Izo soils have mostly gravel larger than 13 millimeters in diameter. Gynelle soils also have Bk horizons. Ioka soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 9 degrees C.  Itme and Izamatch soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section for 10 to 20 days (cumulative) between July and October. Leo soils have strata of sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the control section and have gravel that range up to about 50 millimeters in diameter. Nepalto soils are not stratified and have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR. Wardenot soils contain silica coatings and pendants on rock fragments in a Cqk horizon and have a strata of fine sandy loam in the control section. Willwood soils have mean annual soil temperature of 9 to 10 degrees C, have less than 50 percent coarse and very coarse sands, and are not moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October."
