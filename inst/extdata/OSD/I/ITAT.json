  "OVERVIEW": "The Itat series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt mixed with minor amounts of loess and, in places, old alluvium. Itat soils are on hills and plateaus. Slopes are 5 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
