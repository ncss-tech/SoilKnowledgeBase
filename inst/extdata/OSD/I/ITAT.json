  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Itat soils are on foothills, hillslopes, and plateaus at elevations of 1,300 to 3,400 feet. Itat soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt mixed with minor amounts of loess and in some places old alluvium with quartzitic gravel. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches. The mean January temperature is 26 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is 64 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is about 110 to 140 days."
