Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.

These soils are formed in deep volcanic ash, with small amounts of colluvial coarse fragments in the lower horizons.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 80 to 120 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 21 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 53 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F is about 80 to 110 days."
