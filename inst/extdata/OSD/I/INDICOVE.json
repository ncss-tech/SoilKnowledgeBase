  "OVERVIEW": "The Indicove series consist of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from quartzite. The Indicove soils are on fan remnants and ballenas. Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 225 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
