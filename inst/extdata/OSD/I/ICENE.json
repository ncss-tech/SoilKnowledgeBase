  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Icene soils are on lake terraces. These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks such as tuff and basalt. Surface mantles of eolian sand are commonly present. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. Elevations range from 1,280 to 1,465 meters. The climate is arid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."

Helphenstein, Turpin, Mesman, and Reese soils lack a salic horizon. Helphenstein are somewhat poorly drained and have EC less than 16 mmhos/cm. Turpin and Mesman soils are well drained. Turpin soils are very strongly alkaline throughout the profile and have an EC less than 16 mmhos/cm. Mesman soils have a natric horizon. Reese soils are poorly drained and have a very strongly sodic and saline surface."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 60 and 150 cm (moderately deep to very deep free water occurrence classes) from November through May. Cumulative annual duration class is Common. Depth to ground water is greater than 150 cm in summer. Some phases are susceptible to rare or occasional ponding for brief or very brief duration from February through April with water up to 15 cm deep."
