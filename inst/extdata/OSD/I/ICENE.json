  "OVERVIEW": "The Icene series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from tuff and basalt with surface mantles of eolian sand. Icene soils are on lake terraces. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

The climate is arid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."

Turpin soils are very strongly alkaline throughout the profile and have an EC less than 16 mmhos/cm. Mesman soils have a natric horizon. Reese soils are poorly drained and have a very strongly sodic and saline surface."
