The silty and loamy mantle (material 1), which has 0 to 2 percent of rock fragments, ranges from 10 to 32 inches thick.  It typically has less than 50 percent of particles coarser than very fine sand.  The glacial till (material 2) has 55 to 70 percent of sand and 2 to 8 percent gravel and 0 to 2 percent cobbles of mixed lithology.  A lag line with as much as 35 percent (by volume) of rock fragments is at the base of the upper sediment in some pedons.\nThe O horizon is comprised of accumulated remains of deciduous tree leaves, conifer tree nedles, and forest floor flora.  It is Oa, Oe, or Oi.  The hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  When mixed to 7 inches, the moist value is 3 or 4 and the dry value is 6 or 7.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  It is moderately or strongly acid.\nThe E' horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand.  It has common or many fine vesicular pores.  It is moderately or strongly acid.  The glossic horizon has a 2E/B or a 2B/E horizon or both.  The Bt and E parts each occupy 15 percent to 85 percent of the matrix.  Colors and textures are similar to E and Bt horizons respectively.  It has common or many, fine and very fine vesicular pores primarily in the E' material.  It is moderately or strongly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.  The clay ranges from 8 to 18 percent.  It has many, common or few, prominent to faint clay films on the faces of peds.  It is moderately acid to neutral in the upper part and slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.

These soils formed in a silty mantle of aeolian or lacustrine sediments and underlying loamy glacial till.  Mean annual air temperature is 36 to 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 28 inches.  Frost-free days range from 88 to 135.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 1200 to 1600 feet."
