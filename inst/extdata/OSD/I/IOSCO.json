The Iosco soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of sandy lacustrine deposits or outwash and in the underlying loamy lacustrine deposits or till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.0 to 7.2 degrees C (41 to 45 degrees F)."

The well drained Menominee soils on higher landscape positions and the poorly drained and very poorly drained Brevort soils on lower landscape positions are in the same drainage sequence with the Iosco soils. The Au Gres soils are sandy throughout and are on similar landscape positions. The moderately well drained Croswell soils and excessively drained Rubicon soils are sandy throughout and are on higher landscape positions."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (.5 to 1.5 feet) between September and June in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the upper sandy material and moderately high in the underlying loamy material. Permeability is rapid in the upper sandy material and moderate or moderately slow in the lower loamy horizons."
