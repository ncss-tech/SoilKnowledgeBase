  "OVERVIEW": "The Iosco series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy lacustrine deposits or outwash and the underlying loamy lacustrine deposits or till on ground moraines, outwash plains, and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
