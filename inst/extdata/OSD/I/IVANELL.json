  "OVERVIEW": "The Ivanell series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on side slopes on uplands.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
