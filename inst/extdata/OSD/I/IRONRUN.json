  "OVERVIEW": "The Ironrun series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in siliceous sandy alluvium on pediments and stream terraces.  Permeability is rapid or very rapid.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, thickness and depth are measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  The thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Volume of gravel or sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout.  Reaction typically ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the solum but ranges to neutral in the A and E horizons, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum. Redox accumulations are in the albic or spodic horizon within 20 inches.  Aquic conditions occur within 20 inches for some time in most years.\nThe O horizon has hue of 7.5Yr or 10YR or is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.  It is partially decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR or it is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 to 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.  Some pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  The E horizon is sand or coarse sand.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand.  In some pedons the Bhs horizon has up to 20 percent ortstein.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.  It has texture like the Bhs horizon.  In some pedons the Bs horizon has up to 20 percent ortstein.\nSome pedons have a Bw or BC horizon with hue of hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is sand or coarse sand.  Bw or BC horizons with spodic color have pH greater than 5.9 or have less than 0.6% organic carbon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 8.  It is sand or coarse sand."

Croswell, Halfaday, and Rockdam soils do not have redox features in the spodic horizon or aquic conditions within 20 inches.  In addition, Croswell and Halfaday soils have mixed mineralogy.  Wainola soils are dominantly fine sand and have mixed mineralogy."

The excessively drained Arbutus soils are nearby in some areas along major drainageways where the siliceous sand is underlain by igneous bedrock at 20 to 40 inches. The somewhat poorly drained Fairchild soils and the moderately well drained Ludington soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where the siliceous sand is underlain by interbedded sandstone and shale at 20 to 40 inches.  The moderately well drained Rockdam soils and the poorly drained Ponycreek soils form a drainage sequence with the Ironrun soils."
