  "OVERVIEW": "The Itwo series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from quartzite.  Itwo soils are on mountains. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
