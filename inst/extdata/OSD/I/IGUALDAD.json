    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum ranges from 20 to 32 inches.  Depth to calcareous sand ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  Depth to water table varies from 4 to 30 inches.\nColor of the A horizons ranges in hues of 2.5Y and 10YR, values of 3, and chromas of 1 to 3.\nColors of the B and C horizons have dominantly low chromas.  Texture of the solum and the upper C horizons is clay.  The lower C2g horizons vary in texture from sandy clay to sandy clay loam.  Organic matter content does not decrease regularly with depth."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Vayas and Fortuna series in the same Subgroup and the Perchas, Maunabo, Bajura, Santoni, Josefa, Talante, Coloso, Corcega, and Pinones series in the same Great Group.  The Vayas and Fortuna soils lack sandy horizons in their lower profiles.  The Perchas and Maunabo soils have organic matter content that decreases regularly with depth and lack sandy lower horizons.  The Bajura and Santoni soils have clays with high shrink-swell behavior and common to many pressure faces.  The Josefa, Talante, and Corcega soils have coarser textured profiles and brighter colors in their upper profiles.  The Coloso soils are better drained and have brighter colors in their upper profiles.  The Pinones soils are underlaid by organic layers within their control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Igualdad series occurs on nearly level river flood plains with slope gradients from 0 to 2 percent.  The regolith consists of fine textured sediments over sands.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation is 84 inches and the mean annual temperature is 78 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches deep is over 71.6 degrees F with less than 9 degrees F difference between mean summer and winter temperatures."
