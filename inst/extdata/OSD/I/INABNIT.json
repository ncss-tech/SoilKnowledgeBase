  "OVERVIEW": "The Inabnit series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum derived from sedimentary bedrock.  These soils are on hills, mountain slopes and escarpments. Slopes are 4 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
