  "OVERVIEW": "The Ipano series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or loess over residuum weathered from sandstone. These soils occure on hills, sedimentary plains, and uplands. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

Color ranges and fragment types (and kinds) should be investigated and added to the RIC and typical pedon during an update project.  Ipano soils should also be investigated as to whether they truly have a lithologic discontinuity."
