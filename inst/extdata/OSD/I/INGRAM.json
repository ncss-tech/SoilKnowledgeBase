  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches and corresponds to the depth to indurated basalt or a bed\nof basalt rubble.  Coarse fragments ranging in size from pebbles\nto boulders comprise 15 to 35 percent of the soil.  Stones and boulders on the soil surface range from 15 to 70 percent within a horizontal distance of a few feet.  The soil is clayey throughout.  Clay content ranges from 45 to 60 percent.  The dry soil cracks\nfrom 0.5 to 2.0 inches wide to depths of 20 inches or more.\nThe A horizon is dark brown (7.5YR 3/2; 10YR 3/3), brown (7.5YR\n4/2; 10YR 4/3), reddish brown (5YR 4/3), dark reddish brown (5YR\n3/2; 3/3), or very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2).  Reaction of the\nA horizon ranges from neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon is reddish brown (5YR 5/3, 4/3, 5/4, 4/4), dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3, 3/4), or brown (7.5YR 5/4, 4/4).  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline and calcareous.  Bodies of calcium carbonate range from few to 10 percent by volume in the B horizon.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 2 to about 15 percent.\nA C horizon, 3 to 8 inches thick, of basalt fragments and reddish brown clay is in some pedons."

Similar soils are Dant, Knippa, and Raymondville series, none of which are underlain by basalt or have a lithic contact.\nDant soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Knippa soils have calcic horizons.  Raymondville soils have colors in hue of 10YR in all horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ingram soils occupy isolated hills and\nridges.  They are formed in clays weathered from basalt and\nphonolite on igneous plugs.  Slopes are mostly 10 to 20 percent,\nbut range from 0 to 30 percent.  The climate is warm semiarid.  Average annual rainfall is 20 to 27 inches, and the Thornthwaite\nP-E index is 22 to 40.  At the type location the mean annual temperature is about 70 degrees F."

Montell soils have intersecting slickensides.  Olmos\nsoils have petrocalcic horizons.  Uvalde soils are deep and\ncontain less than 35 percent silicate clay in the control section."
