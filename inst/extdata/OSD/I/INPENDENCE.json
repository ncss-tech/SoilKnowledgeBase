  "OVERVIEW": "The Inpendence series consist of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from welded tuff, chert, shale, and quartzite.  Inpendence soils are on mountains and plateaus.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",

These soils formed in colluvium derived from chert, shale, welded tuffs, and quartzite.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,015 to 2,595 meters.  The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 610 to 710 mm derived mostly from snow.  The mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days.  Frost may occur in any month at the higher elevations."

Bullump soils have argillic horizons and are deep to hard bedrock. Wrenza soils lack a consistant O horizon, are moderately deep, average less than 3 percent organic matter throughout A horizons, and have reactions that are slightly acid in some parts of the umbric epipedon."
