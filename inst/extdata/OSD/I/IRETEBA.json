  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Average annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is less than 71.6 degrees F., and more than 59 degrees F. The soil is dry for more than half the time it is not frozen. Mineralogy is mixed. Color of the soil profile includes hues of 10YR and 7.5YR, values of 6 to 8 dry and 4 to 6 moist, and chromas of 2 to 4. Values of 8 dry and 6 moist occur only in Cca horizons. Texture of the control section is predominantly stratified fine sandy loam and loam, but may include thin (less than 9 inches thick) strata of loamy fine sand, gravelly sandy loam, sandy loam or very fine sandy loam, When mixed, the control section will contain less than 18 percent clay.\nStructure of the A1 horizons ranges from weak or moderate, medium fine to coarse platy or may be massive. The remainder of the profile is either massive or ranges in structure from weak, fine to coarse platy.\nThe Cca horizons contain few to many fine or medium, distinct lime segregations or sufficient disseminated lime to impart high color values. In the former the Cca horizons range in thickness from 3 to 8 inches and contain less than 15 percent CaC03 equivalent or not over 5 percent more than the next underlying horizon. In the latter they are less than 6 inches thick and contain more than 15 percent CaC03. One to several Cca horizons may occur within the control section.\nWeak or strongly lime-cemented strata, up to 15 inches thick, may occur below 40 inches. The soil profile is calcareous throughout. pH of the profile ranges from 8.0 to 9 0 and is usually highest either at the surface or in Cca horizons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These include the Anthony, Gila, and Tobler series.  The Anthony soils are moderately coarse textured and Gila medium textured. Neither soil has Cca horizons that are characteristic of Ireteba soils. Tobler soils are redder, having hues of 5YR to 10YR, and contain many strata of loamy fine sand or loamy sand in the control section, though they are in a coarse loamy family."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on the smooth, nearly level lower margins of alluvial fans and in flat basins. The slope gradients are commonly less than O.2 percent, but may include slopes up to 1 percent.  They have developed in loamy alluvium derived from mixed rock sources including assorted volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Ireteba soils occur at elevations between 1,700 and 2,200 feet where the mean annual precipitation averages about 5 inches. The average annual air temperature is about 66 degrees F.; January about 45 degrees F.; and July 86 degrees F. The frost-free season is about 235 days."

Mead soils are fine textured and somewhat poorly drained.  Arizo soils have very gravelly coarse textured control section. Colorock soils have clay loam textured argillic horizons and lime-indurated hardpans."
