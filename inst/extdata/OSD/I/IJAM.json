  "OVERVIEW": "The Ijam series consists of very deep, poorly drained, low saturated hydraulic conductivity (very slowly permeable) soils that formed from materials dredged from rivers, bays, and canals. These gently sloping soils occur on flats in coastal areas. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1397 mm (55 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F).",
