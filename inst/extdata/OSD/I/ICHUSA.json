    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is more than 60 inches thick.  Depth to alkaline clays ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  The calcium-magnesium ratio is more than 1.0.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam, clay, or silty clay.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe AB horizon, if it occurs, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Redox depletions in shades of gray and redox accumulations in shades of brown, yellow, and red are commmon or many. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bt or Btss horizon commonly has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y but includes hue of 7.5YR.  Value ranges from 4 to 6, and chroma from 4 to 8.  Redox depletions in shades of gray and redox accumulations in shades of brown, yellow, and red are common or many.  Some pedons do not have a dominant matrix color and are multicolored in shades of brown, gray, red, yellow, and olive.  Texture commonly is silty clay or clay, but thin subhorizons of silty clay loam occur in some pedons.  Reaction is very strongly acid in the upper part, and ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the lower part.\nThe Bkss horizon, present in most pedons, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Redox depletions in shades of gray and redox accumulations in shades of brown, yellow, and olive range from few to many.  Some pedons do not have a dominant matrix color and are multicolored in shades of brown, olive, gray, and yellow.  Texture is silty clay or clay.  Soft masses and nodules or concretions of calcium carbonate range from few to many.  Soft masses and/or concretions of iron and manganese oxides range from none to common.  Reaction is commonly slightly acid to slightly alkaline, but ranges to moderately alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Louin series in the same family and the Vaiden series in a closely related family.  Louin soils do not have significant accumulations of secondary carbonates in the solum and have prominent gilgai.  Vaiden soils are very-fine."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ichusa soils are on gently sloping to moderately sloping side slopes on uplands of the Jackson Prairie.  They formed in thick beds of acid clays and the underlying alkaline clayey sediments.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 60 to 65 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 48 to 56 inches."

Louin soils are on broad, nearly level ridgetops with prominent gilgai.  Freest soils are on higher ridgetops or on lower terraces and are fine-loamy.  Leeper and Urbo soils are on adjacent flood plains.  Maytag soils are on slightly higher positions than Ichusa soils and are alkaline to the surface.  Oktibbeha soils are on similar positions as Ichusa soils and have hue of 5YR or redder in the upper part of the subsoil."
