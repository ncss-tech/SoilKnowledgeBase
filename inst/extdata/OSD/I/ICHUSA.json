  "OVERVIEW": "The Ichusa series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in clayey marine sediments.  Permeability is very slow.  They are on uplands of the Jackson Prairie.  Near the type location, the average annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 52 inches.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.",

Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe AB horizon, if it occurs, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Redox depletions in shades of gray and redox accumulations in shades of brown, yellow, and red are commmon or many. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bt or Btss horizon commonly has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y but includes hue of 7.5YR.  Value ranges from 4 to 6, and chroma from 4 to 8.  Redox depletions in shades of gray and redox accumulations in shades of brown, yellow, and red are common or many.  Some pedons do not have a dominant matrix color and are multicolored in shades of brown, gray, red, yellow, and olive.  Texture commonly is silty clay or clay, but thin subhorizons of silty clay loam occur in some pedons.  Reaction is very strongly acid in the upper part, and ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the lower part.\nThe Bkss horizon, present in most pedons, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Redox depletions in shades of gray and redox accumulations in shades of brown, yellow, and olive range from few to many.  Some pedons do not have a dominant matrix color and are multicolored in shades of brown, olive, gray, and yellow.  Texture is silty clay or clay.  Soft masses and nodules or concretions of calcium carbonate range from few to many.  Soft masses and/or concretions of iron and manganese oxides range from none to common.
