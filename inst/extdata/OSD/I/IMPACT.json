Base saturation by NH4OAc is less than 50 percent in some horizon within 180 cm.  Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout.  Reaction typically ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the solum but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe Ap or A horizons hve hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 to 3.  They are sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or fine sand.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is sand or fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 1 to 8.  It is sand or fine sand."
