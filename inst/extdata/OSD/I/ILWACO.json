  "OVERVIEW": "The Ilwaco series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material from deeply weathered siltstone, sandstone and conglomerate bedrock. Ilwaco soils are on uplands and have slopes of 1 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 90 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
