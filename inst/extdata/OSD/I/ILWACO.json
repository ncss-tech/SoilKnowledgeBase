Lytell and Palix soils have more than 35 percent soft siltstone fragments in the control section. Narel and Zenker soils have 40 to 70 percent soft sandstone fragments in the control section. Silcox soils are moderately coarse textured. Swem soils are moderately well drained and have more than 15 percent hard rock fragments (gravel size) in the A and upper B horizons. Sylvia and Willapa soils have mottles with chroma of 2 or less in the control section.

Slopes are 1 to 75 percent. The soils formed in material from deeply weathered siltstone, sandstone and conglomerate. The marine climate is characterized by cool, wet winters, and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 80 to 120 inches. The mean January temperature is 38 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 60 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F. The frost-free period is 160 to 220 days."
