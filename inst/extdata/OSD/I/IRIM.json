  "OVERVIEW": "The Irim series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on nearly level to slightly concave or depressed areas of flood plains and low terraces.  These soils formed in alluvial sediments derived from a variety of sources.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
