  "STATES": "CO,MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Irim series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on nearly level to slightly concave or depressed areas of flood plains and low terraces.  These soils formed in alluvial sediments derived from a variety of sources.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 42 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is 60 degrees F.  The Irim soils typically are noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches, but depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Thin organic horizons typically occur on the surface of these soils but are absent in some pedons.  The 10- to 40_ inch control section is typically loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam and has 18 to 34 percent clay, 15 to 50 percent silt, and 20 to 60 percent sand.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent ina a major part of the control section and are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter but range from1/8 to 10 inches in deameter.  The solum is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of neutral through 2.  Distinct or prominent redoximorphic features occurs in at least some part of the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of neutral through 2.  Distinct or prominent redox features, at least part of which has low chroma, occurs in this horizon."
