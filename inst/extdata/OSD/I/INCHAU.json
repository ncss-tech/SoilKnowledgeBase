Mean annual summer temperature ranges from 50 to 59 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick.  An Oi horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction ranges form medium acid through neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  The texture modified by rock fragments is sandy loam, clay loam, or loam averaging 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Pebbles or channers range from 0 to 35 percent.  Reaction is medium acid through neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  The texture modified by rock fragments is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 50 percent pebbles or channers and 0 to 10 percent flagstones.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid through mildly alkaline."

Amsden, Croydon, Gelkie, Hourglass, Kittridge, Leavitt, Lyonman, Michelson, Monad, Morset, Philipsburg, Sponseller, Swede, Tingey, Wellsville, and Youga soils lack a paralithic contact within depths of 40 inches.  Dra, Kezar, Lucky, Woosley, Miracle, Mult, Newlands, Passcreek, Primeaux, and Rammel soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Buffork soils have more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the control section.  Lymanson soils have secondary calcium carbonate horizons.  Tripit soils have hue of 5YR through 10R and are calcareous in the lower part of the B2t horizon.  Troutdale soils have more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand and approximately 2 to 20 percent flat mica platelets in the B2t horizon."
