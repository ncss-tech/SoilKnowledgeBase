  "OVERVIEW": "The Iffgulch series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium from glaciolacustrine deposits. These soils are in swales and ephemeral drainages which disect stream terraces in glaciolacustrine landforms.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
