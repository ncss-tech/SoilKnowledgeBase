The Sarpy soils are calcareous.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nAdded clay content to the \"Range in Characteristics\" and frost free period to \"Geographic Setting\" from the Soil Interpretation Record.\n1/2004 WAW: Added loamy sand and sand as possible textures to A horizon.  Added rock fragments to Range in Characteristics.  Minor changes made in elevation, MAT, MAP, and frost free days as suggested by Roger Hammer.\nRevised Geographically associated soils.\nModified format by LRM in 10/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
