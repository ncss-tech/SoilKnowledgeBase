    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Isosceles soils are on structural benches of cirques and mountain slopes. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granite and granodiorite, often in narrow bedrock fractures and fissures. Elevation is 2420 to 4135 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 610 to 1505 mm and the mean annual air temperature is -2 to 4 degrees C. The frost free season is 40 to 90 days."
