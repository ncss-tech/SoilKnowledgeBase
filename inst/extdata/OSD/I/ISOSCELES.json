  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Isosceles series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium, slope alluvium and residuum weathered from granitic rocks. The Isosceles soils are on structural benches on cirques and mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1075 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.",
