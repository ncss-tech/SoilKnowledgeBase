  "OVERVIEW": "The Islandlake series consist of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits on kames, moraines, stream terraces, and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 7.2 degrees C (45 degrees F).",
