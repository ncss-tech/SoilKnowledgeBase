  "OVERVIEW": "The Iota series consists of very deep, well drained soils. These soils formed in loamy and clayey sediments of Pleistocene age.  These gently sloping to moderately sloping soils are on terraces.  Slopes range from 3 to 8 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1549 mm (61in).",
