  "OVERVIEW": "The Iceetax series consists of shallowto a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from igneous rocks. Iceetax soils are on fan piedmont remnants.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
