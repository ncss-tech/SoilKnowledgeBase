    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Iceetax soils are on fan piedmont remnants. They typically occur on summit positions. They formed in alluvium derived from igneous rocks. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,590 to 1,740 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
