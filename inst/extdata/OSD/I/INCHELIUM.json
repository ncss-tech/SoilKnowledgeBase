These soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.00 to 1.20 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.   The mollic epipedon is 20 to 42 inches thick.  Depth to calcareous lake sediments range from 50 to more than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section is 10 to 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.\nThe AB horizon has value of 4 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is slightly to strongly effervescent.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Elevation is 1,300 to 2,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F, the mean July temperature is 66 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F.   Frost-free Season is 100 to 130 days."

Hodgson soils have an argillic horizon and are fine.  Hunters soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick.  Lakesol soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick and are frigid.  Phoebe soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick and are coarse-loamy."
