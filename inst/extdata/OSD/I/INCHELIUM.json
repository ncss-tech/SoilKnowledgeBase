  "OVERVIEW": "The Inchelium series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess and glaciofluvial material over lacustrine sediments.  Inchelium soils are on terraces adjacent to uplands.  Slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the average annual temperature is 47 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.00 to 1.20 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.   The mollic epipedon is 20 to 42 inches thick.  Depth to calcareous lake sediments range from 50 to more than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section is 10 to 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.\nThe AB horizon has value of 4 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is slightly to strongly effervescent.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
