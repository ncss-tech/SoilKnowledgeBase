  "OVERVIEW": "The Irongold series consists of shallow to a hardpan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from limestone. Irongold soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
