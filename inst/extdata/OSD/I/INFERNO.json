  "OVERVIEW": "The Inferno series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from volcanic rocks.  Inferno soils are on ridges and mountains.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes are 15 to 35 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
