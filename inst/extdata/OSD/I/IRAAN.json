  "OVERVIEW": "The Iraan series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in calcareous loamy alluvium derived from limestone. These nearly level soils occur on flood plains along streams on dissected plateaus and river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 406 mm (16 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.8 degrees C (64 degrees F).",
