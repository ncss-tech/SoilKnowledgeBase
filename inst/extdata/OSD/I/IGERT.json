    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Igert soils are undulating to hilly on convex summits and sideslopes of structural benches and foothills at elevations of 945 to 1,650 meters. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and slope alluvium from welded rhyolitic tuff and breccia.  The climate is cool and moist in winter and hot and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 250 to 330 mm.  Average annual temperature ranges from 7 to 10 degrees C.  Frost-free period is 90 to 130 days."

The remainder of the OSD has not been updated since 5/93.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - zone 0 to 46 cm (A1, A2 and AB horizons).\nArgillic horizon and particle-size control section - zone 18 to 23 inches (Bt horizon).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 99 cm (R layer).\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
