  "OVERVIEW": "The Igert series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in residuum and slope alluvium from welded rhyolitic tuff and breccia.  Igert soils are on structural benches and foothills.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the annual temperature is about8 degrees C.",
