The soils formed in basic volcanic ash and cinders over pahoehoe lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 1020 to 1270 millimeters (40 to 50 inches), which is generally evenly distributed throughout the year. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1270 to 1780 millimeters (50 to 70 inches). The mean annual temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C. (53 to 57 degrees F.) The mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)"
