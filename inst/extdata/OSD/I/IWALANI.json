    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Iwalani soils are on south and east slopes on the upland and the southwest rift zone of Mauna Loa Volcano at elevations from 1067 to 1646 meters (3500 to 5400 feet). These soils are on all hillslope positions of nearly level to moderately steep pahoehoe flows that are 1,500 to 3,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 2 to 50 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash and cinders over pahoehoe lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 1020 to 1270 millimeters (40 to 50 inches), which is generally evenly distributed throughout the year. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1270 to 1780 millimeters (50 to 70 inches). The mean annual temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C. (53 to 57 degrees F.) The mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)"
