  "OVERVIEW": "The Ima series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium and eolian materials derived dominantly from sandstone and shale of the Jurassic, Triassic, and Permian ages.  These soils are on hillslopes, plains, alluvial fans, terraces, and piedmonts.  Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 381 mm (15 in) and the mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).",
