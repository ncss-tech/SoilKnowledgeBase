  "OVERVIEW": "The Indian Creek series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Indian Creek soils are on high stream terraces and dissected fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
