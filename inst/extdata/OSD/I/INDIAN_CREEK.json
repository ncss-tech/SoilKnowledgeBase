  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Indian Creek soils are on high stream terraces and dissected fan remnants. They typically occur on summit positions. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,375 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."
