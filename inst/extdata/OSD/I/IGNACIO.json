  "OVERVIEW": "The Ignacio series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian material weathered from sandstone.  These soils are on sandsheets on mesas, hills, and ridges and have slopes ranging from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 50 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 12 inches.",
