    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cirac (NV), Eghelm (CO), Gilco (NM), Glenton (WY), Juva (NV), Neskahi (UT), Thoroughfare (CO), and Yelives (NM) series. Glenton soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 47 to 51 degrees F. Juva soils have hue of 10YR or yellower and are dry from May to November. Neskahi soils do not have stratification within the particle-size control section. Cirac soils are moist for less than 20 days cumulative between July and October. Gilco soils contain less than 50 percent sand. Eghelm soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 47 to 50 degrees F. Thoroughfare soils have not been properly differentiated by Colorado. The only identifiable difference is when rock fragments are present; they appear to be greater than 1/2 inch in diameter in the Thoroughfare soil. Yelives soils have colors more yellow than 10YR."

Slopes are dominantly 1 to 3 percent but range from 0 to 8 percent. These soils formed in recent stream alluvium. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 11 inches. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 48 to 57 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 180 days."
