  "OVERVIEW": "The Ioka series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  Ioka soils are on alluvial flats, alluvial fans, and fan remnants.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
