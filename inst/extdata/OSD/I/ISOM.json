  "OVERVIEW": "The Isom series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from limestone, sandstone and shale.  The Isom soils are on alluvial fans.  Slope ranges from 3 to 30 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches.",
