  "OVERVIEW": "The Ishkoten series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum derived from shale and sandstone.  Ishkoten soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",
