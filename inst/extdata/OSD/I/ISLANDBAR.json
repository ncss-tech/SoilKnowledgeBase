  "OVERVIEW": "The Islandbar series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from coarse grained intrusive igneous rocks, mainly trondhjemite or quartz diorite.  Islandbar soils are on ridge tops and side slopes on granitic Sierra Nevada mountains.  Slopes range from 2 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 58 inches, (1473 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F, (13 degrees C).",
