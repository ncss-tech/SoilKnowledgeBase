  "OVERVIEW": "The Iyers series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in calcareous shale.  Iyers soils are on hills, ridges, and mountain side slopes and have slopes of 2 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F. These soils are calcareous throughout.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The particle size control section is clay loam or light clay but ranges from 35 to 50 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent and are mainly 1/4 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  When the soil has dry value of 5 or darker and moist value of 3.5 or darker, the A horizon is too thin to qualify for a mollic epipedon. It is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7, 4 through 6 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline."
