  "OVERVIEW": "The Interior series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sodium enriched alluvium on flood plains, low terraces, fan remnants, and in drainageways.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 405 mm and mean temperature about 9 degrees C.",
