  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to free carbonates ranges from 12 to 35 inches.  These soils typically lack coarse fragments, but they have as much as 3 percent of coarse fragments in some pedons.  The fragments typically are fine pebble in size and primarily calcium carbonate.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 through 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has faint through prominent mottles in some to all parts.  The Ap horizon where present, has value of 3.5 or more.  The A and E horizons are clay, silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, silt loam, or loam.  They are strongly acid through neutral.\nThe Btg horizon has matrix with hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has faint to prominent mottles in some to all parts.  It typically is clay throughout with clay contents of 60 to 85 percent, but it has subhorizons in some pedons that are silty clay or silty clay loam.  It has thin through thick coatings of E material on faces of peds in the upper part.  It is medium acid through neutral in the upper part and neutral through moderately alkaline in the lower part.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It has few through many mottles in at least some part. It is typically clay or silty clay but it has thin strata of silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam in some pedons.  It has slickensides in some pedons.  It is moderately alkaline or mildly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  No other series is in this family.  The Brickton, Effie, and Taylor series are closely related series.  Brickton soils typically have thicker sola and are fine textured.  Effie soils have less clay in the argillic horizon.  Taylor soils typically have 10YR or 2.5Y hue and higher chroma or have chroma of 2 without mottling in the B horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Indus soils have plane and slightly convex slopes in glacial lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in clayey, calcareous glacial lacustrine sediments on glacial lake plains.  Mean annual temperature is about 36 to 40 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 to 28 inches.  The frost-free period is about 100 to 120 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Brickton, Taylor, and Wildwood soils are the main ones.  Brickton soils have landscape position and drainage like that of the Indus soils.  The Taylor and Wildwood soils formed in similar materials are members of a hydrosequence with the Indus soils.  The Taylor soils are moderately well drained and are on higher lying or more sloping terrain.  Wildwood soils are very poorly drained and are in depressions."
