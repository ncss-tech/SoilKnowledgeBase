  "OVERVIEW": "The Indus series consists of deep, poorly and somewhat poorly drained soils formed in clayey calcareous, glacial lacustrine sediment on lake plains.  These soils have slow permeability.  They have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to free carbonates ranges from 12 to 35 inches.  These soils typically lack coarse fragments, but they have as much as 3 percent of coarse fragments in some pedons.  The fragments typically are fine pebble in size and primarily calcium carbonate.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 through 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has faint through prominent mottles in some to all parts.  The Ap horizon where present, has value of 3.5 or more.  The A and E horizons are clay, silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, silt loam, or loam.  They are strongly acid through neutral.\nThe Btg horizon has matrix with hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has faint to prominent mottles in some to all parts.  It typically is clay throughout with clay contents of 60 to 85 percent, but it has subhorizons in some pedons that are silty clay or silty clay loam.  It has thin through thick coatings of E material on faces of peds in the upper part.  It is medium acid through neutral in the upper part and neutral through moderately alkaline in the lower part.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It has few through many mottles in at least some part. It is typically clay or silty clay but it has thin strata of silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam in some pedons.  It has slickensides in some pedons.  It is moderately alkaline or mildly alkaline."
