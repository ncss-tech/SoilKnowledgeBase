  "OVERVIEW": "The Inel series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium over limestone bedrock.  They are on ridgetops and sideslopes of mountains and foothills.  Slopes are 10 to 55 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  Average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
