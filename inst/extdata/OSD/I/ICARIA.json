  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The upper sequum of this soil, which includes the argillic horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches thick. The lower sequum consists of spodic horizons that commonly extend to depths of more than 60 inches.  In some pedons, spodic horizons may be separated by thin albic horizons.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid except for surface layers that have been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, or is neutral; value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Eg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  High chroma masses of iron accumulation are present in some pedons.  Texture is sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam.  In some pedons, there are thin layers of sandy loam, loamy sand, or fine sand.\nThe 2Eb horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe 2Bhb horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a 2C horizon with hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or sandy loam."
