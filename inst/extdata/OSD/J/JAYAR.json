  "OVERVIEW": "The Jayar series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from altered sedimentary and extrusive igneous rocks.  Jayar soils are on mountain side slopes and have slopes of 12 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist but are dry during the summer for 45 to 60 consecutive days in all parts of the moisture control section and are moist throughout during the winter and spring.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent in the particle-size control section.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is loam or clay loam and averages 18 to 30 percent clay, 30 to 70 percent gravel, 0 to 25 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones."

The soils formed in colluvium weathered from sedimentary or metamorphic volcanic rocks.  The climate is characterized by cool, moist to wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 40 to 70 inches but in areas of high winter rainfall, may range to 120 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.   The frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."

Beekman, Colestine, Josephine and Speaker soils are on associated south facing slopes and have mesic soil temperature.  Bigelow and Crannler soils have an umbric epipedon, are at higher elevations, and have cryic soil temperature. Goodwin and Woodseye soils have an umbric epipedon.  Also, Goodwin soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock.  Skymor soils are 12 to 20 inches deep to a lithic contact."

Vegetation is white fir, Douglas fir, creambush oceanspray, common snowberry, Pacific serviceberry, cascade Oregongrape, western princes pine, and deerfoot vanillaleaf.  In high rainfall areas of Curry County, Oregon natural vegetation includes sugar pine, tanoak, golden chinkapin, and Saddler oak."

This series was formerly classified as loamy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Dystric Xerochrepts. Competing series were not checked at that time.\nDiagnostic horizons and features include:\nOchric epipedon\nCambic horizon - the zone from 3 to 31 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 31 inches\nDystric feature - base saturation (NH4OAc) is assumed to be less than 60 percent in all horizons between 10 and 30 inches based on lab data from similar Althouse series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
