  "OVERVIEW": "The Jadpor series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium from extrusive igneous rock.  Jadpor soils are on alluvial terraces.  Slopes ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
