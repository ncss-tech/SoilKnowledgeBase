  "REVDATE": "04/2015",
  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Jadestorm series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from gneissic and granitoid rocks. Jadestorm soils are on hills and mountains. Slope ranges from 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).",

Ramshead soils are formed from sedimentary rocks and have flagstones and channers in the profile. Schenco soils are dominated by channers and have schist lithology. Stormjade soils do not receive appreciable summer precipitation, are generally dry throughout the moisture control section for most of the year and have mean annual soil temperatures (MAST) from 25 to 28 degrees C (77 to 82 degrees F)."
