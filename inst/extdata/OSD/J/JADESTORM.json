  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ramshead (NV), Schenco (AZ) and Stormjade (CA) series. Ramshead soils are formed from sedimentary rocks and have flagstones and channers in the profile. Schenco soils are dominated by channers and have schist lithology. Stormjade soils do not receive appreciable summer precipitation, are generally dry throughout the moisture control section for most of the year and have mean annual soil temperatures (MAST) from 25 to 28 degrees C (77 to 82 degrees F)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jadestorm soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium, from gneissic and granitoid rocks. Elevations range from 425 to 1128 meters (1,395 to 3,700 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 72 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."
