  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 45 to 47 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of soil with vitrandic properties is 10 to 22 inches and it has and estimated bulk density of 1.15 to 1.30 g/cc, glass content of 7 to 20 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half acid oxalate extractable iron of 0.3 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 15 to 26 percent clay and 60 to 75 percent rock fragments by volume.  Base saturation (by NH4OAC) is estimated from 50 to 60 percent between depths of 10 and 30 inches below the soil surface.  Depth to lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, chroma of 4 through 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  The upper part is very gravelly ashy sandy loam, gravelly ashy sandy loam or gravelly ashy loam.  The lower part is very gravelly ashy sandy loam or very gravelly ashy loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 4 through 6 dry or moist.  It is extremely gravelly loam or extremely cobbly loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jummer soils are on mountain sides and have slopes of 45 to 65 percent.  They formed in residuum and colluvium from Teanaway and Grande Ronde basalt, loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash.  Elevation is 3,200 to 4,400 feet.  These soils are in a climate with warm moderately dry summer and cool moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 35 to 50 inches.  Average January temperature is about 24 degrees F. and average July temperature is about 64 degrees F.  Average annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F. is about 145 to 170 days and the frost-free season is about 65 to 100 days."

Jumpe soils are on convex mountain sides, smooth mountain summits and ridges, are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days and have base saturation of 60 to 90 percent in the Bw horizon.  Keechelus soils are on mountain sides and benches, have clayey-skeletal argillic horizons and are very deep.  Kiper soils are on mountain sides, are coarse-loamy with 5 to 20 percent hard sandstone fragments in the control section and are very deep.  Standup soils are on mountain sides, have formed in colluvium and residuum from rhyolite, have sandy loam textures with 10 to 15 percent clay in the control section, chroma of 2 or 3 in the B and C horizons and are very deep."
