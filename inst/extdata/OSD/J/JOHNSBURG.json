  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Johnsburg soils are on nearly level to gently sloping summits and shoulders of hills underlain with siltstone, sandstone or shale bedrock. They formed in loess or silty materials, and the underlying residuum weathered from siltstone, sandstone, and shale. Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 97 to 119 cm (38 to 47inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Johnsburg soils are commonly associated with Apalona, Mullins, Tilsit, Wellston and Zanesville soils on hills. The moderately well drained Apalona and moderately well drained or well drained Zanesville soils are on summits, shoulders and the upper part of backslopes. The poorly drained Mullins soils are on level summits. The moderately well drained Tilsit soils are on narrow summits and shoulders."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) in the upper part of the solum and low to moderately high (0.07 to 1.41 micrometers/s) very slow in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and very slow in the lower part. The potential for surface water runoff is medium. In drained areas, depth to an intermittent perched high water table is at 15 to 61 centimeters (0.5 to 2.0 feet) from December through April in most years."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic surface and subsurface horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon- the zone from 0 to 36 cm or 0 to 14 inches (Ap, EB horizons);\n2) Argillic horizon- the zone from 36 to 183 cm or 14 to 72 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Btg, Btx1, Btx2 horizons);\n3) Fragipan- the zone from 91 to 183 cm or 36 to 72 inches (Btx2 horizon);\n4) Redoximorphic features: from 25 to 229 cm or 10 to 90 inches (EB, Bt1, Bt2, Btg, Btx1, 2Btx2 ,2BC horizons)\n5) Paralithic contact: at 229 cm or 90 inches (2Cr horizon)\nIn 1996, the type location has been moved to a more representative area within MLRA 120B. This series is correlated across a wide range of Major Land Resource Areas (MLRA's). The series concept and range of soil properties will be evaluated to determine the proper MLRA's for this series.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Partial characterization data available for typical pedon (BPR) from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
