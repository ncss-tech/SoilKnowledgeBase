Of these, only Bonnell, Cosperville, Heverlo, Kewaunee, Milton, Mountpleasant, and Muncie soils contain glacial erratics. Bonnell, Kewaunee, and Muncie soils have the lower part of their sola formed in till and have some crystalline rocks in the lower part of the solum. Cosperville soils do not have a loess mantle and textures containing more than 50 percent silt in the upper part of the series control section. Heverlo soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Milton soils have a lithic contact within a depth 102 cm (40 inches). Mountpleasant soils have carbonates within a depth of 91 cm (36 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jessup soils are on glaciated uplands near the margin of the Illinoian till sheet. They are on upper shoulders below areas of thicker till or are on narrow, beveled interfluves. Slope ranges from 1 to 35 percent. The soils formed in a mantle of loess 25 to 61 cm (10 to 24 inches) thick and in the underlying weathered Illinoian till and residuum from calcareous Ordovician shale and thin strata of limestone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 965 to 1168 mm (38 to 46 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cincinnati, Edenton, Fairmount, Faywood, Loudon, Otway, and Rossmoyne soils. Cincinnati and Rossmoyne soils are on broad interfluves having a thicker deposit of till and have fragipans. Edenton soils are moderately deep to bedrock, and are on upper shoulders and backslopes. Fairmount, Faywood, and Otway soils are in unglaciated areas and are on the steeper slopes that are dominated by limestone. The moderately well drained Loudon soils are on toeslopes and on broader interfluves than Jessup soils."

Preliminary data indicates that clay mineralogy is well into the mixed class but there is an increase in illitic clay minerals in the lower part of the control section.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
