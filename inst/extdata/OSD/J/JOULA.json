  "OVERVIEW": "The Joula series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy glaciolacustrine deposits. These soils are on glacial lake plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 670 millimeters.",
