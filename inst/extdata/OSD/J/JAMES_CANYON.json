Potential competitors in similar families are the Comfrey, Delft, Excello, Gielow, Nosal, Peoh, and Romnell series.\nComfrey, Coland, Delft, Glencoe, Lundlake, and Shandep soils are more moist in the moisture control section in the 120 days following the summer solstice.  Excello soils have mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 15 degrees C.  Gielow soils have mean annual soil temperature of 13 to 15 degrees C.  Gus soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are more moist in the moisture control section in the 120 days following the summer solstice.  Keddie soils average 40 to 50 percent sand in the particle-size control section.  Kimmerling and Konner soils have 27 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  McClave soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Nosal soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have subhorizons between 40 and 60 cm with very gravelly or extremely gravelly textures.  Peoh soils average less than 10 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Romnell soils have 1 to 4 percent gypsum and 10 to 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the particle-size control section.  Roundval soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have mean annual soil temperature of 13 to 15 degrees C.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  James Canyon soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are O to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,280 to 1,830 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 410 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 160 days."

The native vegetation is mainly basin wildrye, alkali sacaton, bluegrass, mat muhly, and rubber rabbitbrush.  Some of the drained areas are cultivated with alfalfa, small grains, and legume-grass pasture as the primary crops."
