  "OVERVIEW": "The Jumble series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till derived dominantly from quartzite and granite. Jumble soils are on moraines. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 750 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 2 degrees C.",
