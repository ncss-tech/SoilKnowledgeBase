  "OVERVIEW": "The Jenksdraw series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in local alluvium or residuum from limestone and calcareous sandstone.  Jenksdraw soils are on shoulders and backslopes of ridges and hillslopes in mountains.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 760 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
