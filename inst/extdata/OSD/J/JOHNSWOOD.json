  "REVDATE": "04/1999",
  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Johnswood series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy glacial drift on ground moraines and glacial lake benches. They are shallow to dense glacial till. Permeability is slow.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to free carbonates is typically 12 to 18 inches and ranges from 10 to 20 inches.   Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent in the A and A/B horizon, and 35 to 70 in the remainder of the pedon. Volume of gravel ranges from 5 to 15 percent in the A and A/B horizons and from 5 to 25 percent in the remainder of the pedon. Cobbles and flagstones range from 15 to 35 percent in the A and A/B horizons and from 5 to 25 percent in the remainder of the pedon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is the cobbly, flaggy, or very flaggy analogues of loam, silt loam or sandy loam. Reaction rages from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have E horizons.  Where present, they have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are the cobbly, flaggy or very flaggy analogues of sandy loam or loam. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is the  very cobbly, extremely cobbly, very flaggy, extremely flaggy gravelly or very gravelly analogues of loam, clay loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is the  very gravelly, extremely gravelly very cobbly, extremely cobbly, very flaggy, or extremely flaggy analogues of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  Reaction is moderately alkaline."

These glacial deposits are generally considered to have been covered with water of glacial lakes during Late Wisconsinan glaciation.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 31 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Detour, Hessel, Longrie, Onaway and Summerville series. The somewhat poorly drained Detour soils and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Hessel soils are in lower landscape positions and form a drainage sequence with the Johnswood soils.  Longrie and Summerville soils are underlain by limestone bedrock at a depth of less than 40 inches.  The Onaway soils are on moraines and drumlins of older Wisconsinan Age glacial deposits and have less coarse fragments throughout."

This soil has a perched seasonal high water table that ranges from 1 to 2 feet below the surface at times during the period from October to May. Surface runoff is moderate or moderately rapid depending upon slope.  Permeability is slow."
