Bissell soils have base saturation of over 75 percent and are 24 to 50 inches deep to the base of the argillic horizon. Bjork, Dodes, Noslo, Pahrange, Uhaldi are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Indiano, Madras, Quiero, Simcoe and Shoebend soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Cowiche soils have less than 5 percent rock fragments in their control section and have 2Bk horizons. Fernpoint soils have extremely cobbly 2C horizons and secondary calcium carbonates at 40 to 50 inches. Hullsgulch soils have lamellae in E&Bt horizons below the argillic horizon and base saturation greater than 75 percent. Margerum soils have 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments, dominantly pumice in the control section. Orr soils are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and rock fragments are not of granitic origin. Quailridge soils are less than 25 inches to the base of the argillic horizon have lamellae in E&Bt horizons. Ralls soils have 15 to 35 percent basalt rock fragments in the control section and have moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline C horizons. Springmeyer soils are dry more than 145 days during summer and fall and do not have rock fragments dominantly of granitic origin. Truax soils have Bq horizons. Wenatchee soils are less than 60 inches to the base of the argillic horizon and do not have rock fragments dominantly of granitic origin."
