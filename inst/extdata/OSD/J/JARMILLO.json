Coberly soils have weathered bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Dotsero, Hedoes, and Parshall soils are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and have secondary accumulation of carbonate.  Ruso soils have stratified sand and gravel within 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jarmillo soils are developed in alluvium, colluvium and lacustrine sediments on terraces that have slopes of 1 to 20 percent.  They formed in deposits derived dominantly from rhyolite and tuff.  Elevations are 8,000 to 8,800 feet.  The climate is subhumid continental with a mean annual precipitation of about 20 to 25 inches with moist winters and late summers and dry spring.  The mean annual temperature is about 42 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is about 70 to 100 days."
