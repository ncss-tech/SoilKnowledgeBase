  "OVERVIEW": "The Jarmillo series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium and lacustrine sediment derived mainly from rhyolite and tuff.  Jarmillo soils are on terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The climate is subhumid continental with a mean annual precipitation of about 20 to 25 inches with moist winters and late summers and dry spring.  The mean annual temperature is about 42 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is about 70 to 100 days."
