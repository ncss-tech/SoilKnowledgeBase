  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Joecut soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on footslope and backslope positions.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 6,000 to 8,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches, mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."
