  "OVERVIEW": "The Joecut series consists of very deep, moderately well drained or well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Joecut soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
