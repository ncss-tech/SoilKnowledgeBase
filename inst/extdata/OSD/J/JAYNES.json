  "OVERVIEW": "The Jaynes series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium from gneiss and schist.  Jaynes soils are on relict fan terraces and have slopes of 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 68 degrees F.",

Typically breaks down after prolonged soaking and shaking in water.  Roots can enter the matrix when moist but is root restrictive when dry.\nGenesis:  Thought to be Pleistocene age sediments that were naturally compacted by a combination of paleo lake water loading and subsequent impregnation by calcium carbonate and low levels of silica."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 5 inches (A horizon)\nCompacted layers - The zone from 10 to 60 inches (2Cdk1, 2Cdk2, 3Cd horizons)\nEntisol feature - The absence of diagnostic subsurface horizons\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.\nIn October 2000, taxonomic classification was converted to the closest\nmatch found in Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition 1999.  No update was made\nto horizon nomenclature, competing series section, etc.  Other\nplacements may be more appropriate after a complete update.\nClassification changed to better reflect the nature of the compacted layers.  These layers are not duripans but are intergrades between rock (paralithic) materials and unconsolidated alluvium.  They are root restrictive when dry but not restrictive when moist."
