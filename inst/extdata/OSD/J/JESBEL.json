  "OVERVIEW": "The Jesbel series consists of well drained (maximal) Chestnut soils which have caliche hardpans and are developed on undulating to gently sloping topography under annual grass-herb vegetation.  The parent material consists of gravelly and cobbly old alluvium that had its source in metamorphosed sedimentary rocks, chiefly graphitic slates of the Mariposa formation.  The Jesbel soils are characterized by dark grayish brown gravelly clay loam or gravelly clay A1 horizons and dark brown gravelly clay B horizons overlying strongly cemented caliche hardpans at moderate depths.  The Jesbel soils occur in the same general area as the Daulton, Cometa, Whiterock, Whitney and similar old terraces and lower foothills.  They somewhat resemble the Buchenau soils from similar parent materials.  The Buchenau soils are calcareous throughout, have weakly developed textural and structural B horizons, and the caliche hardpan horizons are more calcareous than those of the Jesbel soils.  The Daulton and Whiterock soils consist of shallow Lithosols developing directly from the Mariposa formation bedrock and the Cometa and Whitney are older soils derived from granitic alluvium in high terraces.",
