  "OVERVIEW": "The Joyuda series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, moderately permeable soils in tidal marshes of the Humid Coastal Plains MLRA.  They formed in decomposed organic material.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 63 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",
