They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, schist, and Tertiary micaceous sandstone and siltstone.  Slopes are 10 to 60 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 6,900 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.   The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."

Panky and Agua Fria soils are fine-loamy, have argillic horizons, and occur on summits of erosional fan remnants.  Xenmack soils are fine-loamy, are moderately deep to a paralithic contact, and occur on adjacent risers of strath terrace remnants.  Zozobra soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, have calcic horizons, and occur on adjacent shoulders of erosional fan remnants."
