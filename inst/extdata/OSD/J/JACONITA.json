  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Jaconita series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from granite, gneiss, schist, and micaceous sandstone and siltstone.  Jaconita soils are on footslopes and backslopes of eroded fan remnants and risers of strath terrace remnants.  Slopes are 10 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
