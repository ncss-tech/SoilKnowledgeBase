  "OVERVIEW": "The Jenera series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in stratified loamy and silty glaciolacustrine material 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) thick and in the underlying till. They are on lake plains and in shallow lacustrine areas on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
