  "OVERVIEW": "The Jacques series consists of very deep, well drained soils on alluvial fans, stream terraces and flood plains.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Slope is 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
