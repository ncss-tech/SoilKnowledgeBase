It does not qualify as a diagnostic horizon as presently defined in Soil Taxonomy.  A change to Soil Taxonomy is needed to remove the diagnostic horizon terminology from the greatgroup criteria.  The criteria should be similar to that as stated in Durudands and Durudepts; cemented horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Reference sample 0 to 10 inches, 01WA-027-002, and 04WA-027-008.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
