  "OVERVIEW": "The Joecreek series consists of shallow to a cemented horizon over dense glacial till. The soil is poorly drained and is on glacial outwash terraces on till plains. These soils formed in silty glaciolacustrine deposits over gravelly glacial outwash. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 inches, the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 180 to 220 days.",

It does not qualify as a diagnostic horizon as presently defined in Soil Taxonomy.  A change to Soil Taxonomy is needed to remove the diagnostic horizon terminology from the greatgroup criteria.  The criteria should be similar to that as stated in Durudands and Durudepts; cemented horizon."
