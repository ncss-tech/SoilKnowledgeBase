  "OVERVIEW": "The Joliet series consists of shallow, poorly drained soils formed in loamy drift overlying limestone or dolostone bedrock. These soils are on lake plains, outwash plains, and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches) and mean annual soil temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",

The depth to the base of soil development ranges from 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches). Rock fragments are limestone channers, and glacial erratics of mixed lithology.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 (5 or less dry), and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. The silt loam and silty clay loam textures are estimated to contain from 15 to 20 percent sand. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or N; value of 3 to5; and chroma of 0 to 2. It is loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Cg horizon 1 to 3 inches thick immediately above the bedrock."
