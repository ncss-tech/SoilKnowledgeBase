The depth to the base of soil development ranges from 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches). Rock fragments are limestone channers, and glacial erratics of mixed lithology.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 (5 or less dry), and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. The silt loam and silty clay loam textures are estimated to contain from 15 to 20 percent sand. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or N; value of 3 to5; and chroma of 0 to 2. It is loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Cg horizon 1 to 3 inches thick immediately above the bedrock."

Mean annual temperature ranges from 9 to 12 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 740 to 1020 mm (29 to 40 inches), frost free days range from 140 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 152 to 311 meters (500 to 1,020 feet) above sea level."
