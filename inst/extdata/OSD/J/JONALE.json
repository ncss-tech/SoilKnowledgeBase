  "OVERVIEW": "The Jonale series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvial material derived from conglomerate.  Jonale soils are on hills and have slopes of 0 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
