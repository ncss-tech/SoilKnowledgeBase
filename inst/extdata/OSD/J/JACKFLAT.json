  "OVERVIEW": "The Jackflat series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from granodiorite.  Jackflat soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
