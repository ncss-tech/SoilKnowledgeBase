  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jackflat soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on summit and shoulder positions.  They formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from granodiorite.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 2,440 to 2,740 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 600 mm, the mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
