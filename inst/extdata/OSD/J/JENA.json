Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the A horizon and from very strongly acid to strongly acid in the Bw and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Loamy fine sand occurs in some subhorizons in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6 throughout, or it is variegated with shades of gray and brown in the lower part. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy fine sand. Sand strata range from none to common below a depth of 40 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Owentown series in the same family. Soils in similar families are Beulah, Cascilla, Ennis, Iuka, Kirkville, Lobelville, Mantachie, Ochlockonee, and Riverview series. Owentown soils are moderately well drained with a seasonally saturated zone at 2.5 to 4 feet.  Beulah soils have mixed mineralogy. Cascilla, Ennis, Lobelville, Mantachie, and Riverview soils have more than 18 percent clay in the 10- to 40- inch control section. Also, Mantachie soils have grayish colors and aquic conditions within 20 inches of the surface. Iuka and Ochlockonee soils have bedding planes in the upper 20 inches of the solum. Kirkville soils have grayish iron depletions in the B horizon."

The soil developed in acid, loamy coastal plain alluvium. The climate is humid subtropical. Near the type location, the average annual temperature is 65 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 56 inches."

Arkabutla soils have fine silty control sections. Cahaba, Guyton, Kalmia, Myatt, and Stough soils have argillic horizons. Also, Guyton and Myatt soils have lower chroma colors below the A horizon and Stough soils have 1 or 2 chroma mottles below the A horizon."
