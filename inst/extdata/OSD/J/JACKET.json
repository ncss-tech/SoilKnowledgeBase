They formed in loess and residuum and colluvium weathered from Columbia River basalt.  Elevations are 1,000 to 5,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid with warm summers and cold winters.  Average annual precipitation is 22 to 30 inches.  Average January temperature is 27 degrees F.; average July temperature is 67 degrees F.  Average annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 90 to 180 days."
