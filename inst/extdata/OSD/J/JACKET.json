  "OVERVIEW": "The Jacket series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and material weathered from basalt.  Jacket soils are on hills on plateaus, benches, broad ridges and footslopes in canyons. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Permeability is slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the average annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
