  "OVERVIEW": "The Jagerson series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed volcanic sources.  The Jagerson soils are on fan terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",
