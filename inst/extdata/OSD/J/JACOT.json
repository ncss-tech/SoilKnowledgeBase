  "OVERVIEW": "The Jacot series consists of very deep, well drained soils on hillslopes, mountain slopes and ridges. They formed in colluvium weathered from gneiss or granitic bedrock with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Slopes are 3 to 80 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 965 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",
