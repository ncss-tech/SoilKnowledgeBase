  "OVERVIEW": "The Jaypeak series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains and escarpments.  They formed in material weathered from schist, gneiss, and granite bedrock with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and moderate to moderately rapid below.  Slope ranges from 5 to 85 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 35 inches.",
