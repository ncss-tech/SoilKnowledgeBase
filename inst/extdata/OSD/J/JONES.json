All these soils have base saturation of less than 35\npercent 50 inches below the top of argillic horizon.  Lucy and Troup soils have sandy A horizons over 20 inches thick.  Luverne soils have control sections with more than 35 percent clay.  Pine Flat soils have thicker argillic horizons and have upper B horizons of dark red color."
