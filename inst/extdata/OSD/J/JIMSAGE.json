The average annual precipitation is about 300 to 460 mm, the average annual air temperature is about 4.4 to 6.7 degrees C., and the frost- free season is 70 to 95 days."

Rexburg and Watercanyon soils have a coarse silty texture control section. Hutchley and Vitale soils are on cuestas and southerly slopes. Hutchley is also on ridge tops. Povey soils are in bowl shaped areas, generally at higher altitudes than Jimsage.  Rexburg and Watercanyon soils are on mountainsides."
