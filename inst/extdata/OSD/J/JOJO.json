  "OVERVIEW": "The Jojo series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on mountains.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from pyroclastic ash flow and andesite.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 90 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist and are not dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for as long as 45 consecutive days in the four months that follow the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 36 to 38 degrees F.  Depth to pyroclastic ash flow or andesite is 20 to 40 inches.   The particle-size control section has 40 to 80 percent rock fragments and averages less than 15 percent clay.  Phosphate retention is more than 85 percent and the acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate extractable iron is between 2 and 5 percent in the less than 2.0 mm fraction.  There is 25 to 40 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregate in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction.  The 15-bar water is 12 to 15 percent on air dried samples and less than 30 percent on undried samples.  It has a moist bulk density of 0.80 to 0.90 g/cc.  It is moderately acid to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam with 0 to 30 percent boulders, 10 to 40 percent stones, 5 to 10 percent cobbles, and 5 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand.  Rock fragments range from 45 to 80 percent of which 35 to 55 percent are gravel, 10 to 20 percent are cobbles and 0 to 5 percent are stones.\nThe 2Cr horizon is pyroclastic ash flow or highly weathered andesite."
