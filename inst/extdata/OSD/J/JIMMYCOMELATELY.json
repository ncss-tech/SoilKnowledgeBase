    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are the following:\nOchric epipedon\nGlossic horizon - 6 to 40 inches (E/Bt1, E/Bt2, Bt/E1, and Bt/E2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon - 16 to 61 inches (E/Bt2, Bt/E1, Bt/E2, and Bt horizons)\nPSCS - zone from 16 to 36 inches (E/Bt2, Bt/E1 and Bt/E2 horizons)\nAquultic subgroup - redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less at 16 inches or 15 inches from the mineral soil surface.  Base saturation by sum of cations is assumed to be less than 75 percent in some part of the argillic horizon.\nThe soils formed in relic proglacial lake deposits in a wetter environment.  The presence of the E horizon material and redox features in the upper horizons were not formed from present day pedogenesis.\nAll depths to diagnostic horizons and other features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
