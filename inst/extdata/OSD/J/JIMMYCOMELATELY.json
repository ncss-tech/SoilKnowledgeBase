  "OVERVIEW": "The Jimmycomelately series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from proglacial lake deposits and continental glacial till on low relief, dissected uplands.  Slopes are 30 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 35 inches and average annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

Base saturation by sum of cations is assumed to be less than 75 percent in some part of the argillic horizon.\nThe soils formed in relic proglacial lake deposits in a wetter environment.  The presence of the E horizon material and redox features in the upper horizons were not formed from present day pedogenesis.\nAll depths to diagnostic horizons and other features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon."
