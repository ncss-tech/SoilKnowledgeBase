  "OVERVIEW": "The Juncal series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils on foot slopes and low rounded hill sides of uplands.  They formed in limestone residuum.  Slopes range from 5 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 90 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F.",

These soils are slightly sticky and plastic throughout.\nThe A horizon is in hues of 7.5YR or 10YR, in values of 4, and in chromas from 2 or 3.  The A horizon is medium or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizons have colors in hues of 7.5YR or 10YR, in values  of 4 or 5, and chromas from 4, 6, or 8.  Clay is the dominant texture in the solum and coarser in the C horizon.  Structure ranges from moderate fine to medium subangular blocky.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon is calcareous and effervescence ranges from slight to strong.  Base saturation (by sum of cations) is more than 60 percent at 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon."
