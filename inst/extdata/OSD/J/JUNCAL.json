  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 36 inches to 60 inches.  These soils are slightly sticky and plastic throughout.\nThe A horizon is in hues of 7.5YR or 10YR, in values of 4, and in chromas from 2 or 3.  The A horizon is medium or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizons have colors in hues of 7.5YR or 10YR, in values  of 4 or 5, and chromas from 4, 6, or 8.  Clay is the dominant texture in the solum and coarser in the C horizon.  Structure ranges from moderate fine to medium subangular blocky.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon is calcareous and effervescence ranges from slight to strong.  Base saturation (by sum of cations) is more than 60 percent at 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon."

The Rio Arriba soils have cracks at some period during most years and clays with COLE values that exceed 0.09.  The San Sebastian soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in their profiles and are calcareous throughout.  The Tanama soils have hard rock within 20 inches of the soil surface."
