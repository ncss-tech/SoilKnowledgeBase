  "OVERVIEW": "The Jacobsville series consists of moderately deep, poorly drained soils formed in loamy till over sandstone bedrock on ground moraines and sandstone benches. Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

It is dominantly mucky sandy loam but the\nrange includes mucky fine sandy loam and mucky loamy sand.  Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, sandy loam, loamy sand or the gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures.  Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.
