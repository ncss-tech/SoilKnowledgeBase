The volume of gravel and cobbles range from 0 to 20 percent, and volume of stones range from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or is neutral, with value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is dominantly mucky sandy loam but the\nrange includes mucky fine sandy loam and mucky loamy sand.  Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, sandy loam, loamy sand or the gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures.  Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly of cobbly analogues of these textures.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loamy sand.
