  "OVERVIEW": "The Judson series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in silty colluvium derived from non-calcareous loess. These soils are on foot slopes, upland drainageways, and alluvial fans. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters.",
