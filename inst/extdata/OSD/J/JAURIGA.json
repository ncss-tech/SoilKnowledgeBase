  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jauriga soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on toeslope positions.  These soils formed in volcanic ash over colluvium and residuum derived from andesite or basalt.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,300 to 6,000 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches including about 20 to 40 inches of snow.  The mean annual temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F., the mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 80 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision of December 2003 updates the taxonomic class from Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argixerolls based on lab data for this soil and associated soils.  Oxalate aluminum plus one half extractable iron and volcanic glass content in the A horizons is estimated.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 17 inches (A1, A2, and Bt1 horizons).\nVitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 9 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 9 to 49 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 49 inches to underlying soft, weathered bedrock (Cr layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 9 to 29 inches (Bt1 horizon and part of the Bt2 horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  A pedon of Jauriga has full characterization by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S87CA-035-001 (pedon # 87P0679).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
