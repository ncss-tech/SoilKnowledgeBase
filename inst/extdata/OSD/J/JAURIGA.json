  "OVERVIEW": "The Jauriga series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over colluvium and residuum derived from andesite or basalt.  Jauriga soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

Oxalate aluminum plus one half extractable iron and volcanic glass content in the A horizons is estimated.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 17 inches (A1, A2, and Bt1 horizons).\nVitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 9 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 9 to 49 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 49 inches to underlying soft, weathered bedrock (Cr layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 9 to 29 inches (Bt1 horizon and part of the Bt2 horizon)."
