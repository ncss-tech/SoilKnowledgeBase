All of these soils except Scandard, Tamred and Timberlin are deeper than 40 inches to any bedrock. Buffmeyer soils have gravelly sandy loam Bt horizons. Condie soils have Bt horizons with hue of 5YR through 10R.  Guiser soils have average annual soil temperature of 42 to 47 degrees F.  Jonda soils have a calcic horizon at 10 to 21 inches.  Mulgon soils have hues of 7.5YR or 5YR in the Bt.  Namon soils have Bt horizons of very cobbly very fine sandy loam to very cobbly heavy sandy loam.  Scandard soils have hue of 10R to 5YR in the argillic horizon.  Tamred soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the argillic horizon and lack E horizons.  Wapshilla soils lack E horizons.  Timberlin soils are over interbedded shale and sandstone, shale material is paralithic, sandstone is lithic and rock fragments are primarily flagstones."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Judkins soils are on northerly slopes in uplands. Slopes range from 1 to 80 percent but are dominantly 30 to 65 percent. The soils formed in residuum and slope alluvium weathered from rhyolite, rhyolitic tuff, or latite. In some places the upper horizons contain an admixture of loess. Elevations are 5,500 to 7,000 feet. The climate is cool subhumid continental, having fairly dry late summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 18 to 30 inches. The annual temperature is 34 degrees to 40 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 30 to 70 days."
