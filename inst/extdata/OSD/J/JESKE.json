Depth to paralithic contact ranges from 25 to 51 centimeters and depth to lithic contact ranges from 51 to 102 centimeters. Cobble and gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent.\nSome pedons have a thin A horizon. The A horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR of 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy loam, loamy sand or sand.  Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe C horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sand or loamy sand. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe 2Cr horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, values of 3 to 6, and chromas of 2 to 4. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid."
