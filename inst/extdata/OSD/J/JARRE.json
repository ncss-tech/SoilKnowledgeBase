  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Jarre soils typically are noncalcareous throughout and depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Base saturation typically is greater than 80 percent and ranges from 60 to 100 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the solum but increase to more than 35 percent in the C horizon.  They range from 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter but are predominantly less than 3 inches in diameter.  The solum and C horizons range from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  The mean annual soil temperature is 46 degrees F., and the mean summer summer soil temperature is 63 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically loam or clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 50 percent silt, and 20 to 55 percent sand with less than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.\nThe C horizon normally has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  Subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  This horizon is gravelly or very gravelly sandy loam with less than 18 percent clay."

Cheesman, Marmarth, and Duffson soils have bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches.  Assinniboine, Evanston, Joplin, Kevin, Morval, Telstad, and Villa Grove soils are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon and have continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation.  Bostwick, Perrypark, Turret and Peyton soils have less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the B2t horizon and have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the C horizons.  Perrypark soils have hue of 5YR or redder.  Peyton soils have a large proportion of medium, coarse, and very coarse angular granite sand in their sand fraction."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on alluvial fans or old terrace levels.  Slope gradients range from 1 to 30 or more percent.  The soils formed in thick gravelly or very gravelly pedisediments derived from mixed sources.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 17 inches, with peak period of precipitation occurring in the spring and summer."
