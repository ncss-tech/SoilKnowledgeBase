These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the 4 months following the summer solstice.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section has 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume and 8 to 20 percent clay.  Base saturation by ammonium acetate is 70 to 90 percent throughout the profile.  The upper part of the solum from a depth of 12 to 25 inches has acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron of 1 to 2 percent and moist bulk density of 0.80 to 1.00 g/cc.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 2 through 4 moist.  It has 5 to 10 percent organic matter.  Moist bulk density if 0.50 to 0.90 g/cc.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist, value of 5 through 7 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 or 6 dry and moist.  It is extremely gravelly sandy loam, extremely cobbly sandy loam, or extremely gravelly loam.  Reaction is moderately or slightly acid.  Moist bulk density if 0.80 to 1.20 g/cc in the upper part and ranges to 1.80 g/cc in the lower part."
