  "OVERVIEW": "The Juandefuca series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from marine basalt and associated volcanic rocks on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 60 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 50 inches and average annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

Base saturation by ammonium acetate is 70 to 90 percent throughout the profile.  The upper part of the solum from a depth of 12 to 25 inches has acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron of 1 to 2 percent and moist bulk density of 0.80 to 1.00 g/cc.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 2 through 4 moist.  It has 5 to 10 percent organic matter.  Moist bulk density if 0.50 to 0.90 g/cc.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist, value of 5 through 7 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 or 6 dry and moist.  It is extremely gravelly sandy loam, extremely cobbly sandy loam, or extremely gravelly loam.  Reaction is moderately or slightly acid.  Moist bulk density if 0.80 to 1.20 g/cc in the upper part and ranges to 1.80 g/cc in the lower part."
