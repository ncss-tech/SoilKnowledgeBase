  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Jefflake series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in glacial till which overlies soft sediments of Quaternary and Tertiary Age.  These soils are on mountain slopes, ridges, plateaus, and basins.  Slopes are both simple or complex and are 0 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  Some or all parts of the argillic horizon contain low chroma mottles of 2 or 1 within 30 inches of the surface.\nThe E horizon has hue of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Coarse fragments range from 35 to 60 percent pebbles or cobbles or a mixture of each.  It is very strongly acid through medium acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 8.  Matrix texture is clay, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay.  Coarse fragments range from 35 to 60 percent pebbles, cobbles, or a mixture of each.  Low chroma mottles are common and some horizons are gleyed throughout.  It is very strongly acid through slightly acid."
