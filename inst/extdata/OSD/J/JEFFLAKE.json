  "OVERVIEW": "The Jefflake series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in glacial till which overlies soft sediments of Quaternary and Tertiary Age.  These soils are on nearly level to moderately steep mountain slopes, ridges, plateaus, and basins.  Slopes are both simple or complex and are 0 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
