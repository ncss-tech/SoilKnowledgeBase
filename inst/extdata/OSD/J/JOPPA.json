  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Gravel content ranges from 15 to 35 percent in the A, E and BE horizons, 35 to 60 percent in the Bt horizon and 35 to 70 percent in the C horizon.  The C horizon can have up to 10 percent cobbles but total rock fragment content is less than 70 percent.  Soil reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid throughout unless it has been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A horizons are gravelly sandy loam, gravelly loam or gravelly loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma or 3 or 4.  Texture is gravelly sandy loam, gravelly loam or gravelly loamy sand.\nThe B horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8.  The BE horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR.  The Bt horizon texture is very gravelly sandy loam to gravelly loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8, color can be variegated.  The C horizon is very gravelly sand to gravelly sandy loam.  Some pedons have a 2C horizon below 40 inches that do not have gravel and have loamy sand to sandy clay textures.\nCOMPETING SERIES  These are the Grimsley and Pocono series in the same family.  These both have sola thicker than 40 inches.\nThe Blackthorn, Croom, Elliber, Gainesboro, Hartleton, Irondale, Lew, Mertz, Pattenburg, Trevlac and Weverton are similar soils in a related family.  They all have mixed mineralogy."
