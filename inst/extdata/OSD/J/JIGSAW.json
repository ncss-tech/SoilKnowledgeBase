The soil is dry for 50 to 60 percent of the time the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F.  It is usually dry in some part of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days out of the 120 days after June 21st.  The soil moisture regime is aridic bordering on xeric.\nThe particle-size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  It is strongly effervescent to violently effervescent throughout, and is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is loam, silty clay loam, silt loam or clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 to 5.  Texture is commonly silty clay loam but ranges to loam, and has less than 15 percent rock fragments."

These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from intermediate igneous and sedimentary rocks.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  The freeze-free period is 120 to 150 days."
