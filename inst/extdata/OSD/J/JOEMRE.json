  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 65 degrees F.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon exceeds 10 inches.  Rock fragment content is less than 15 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR; value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist; and chroma of 3 through 6 dry and moist.  Clay ranges from 6 to 12 percent.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR; value of 4 through 6 dry, and 3 or 4 moist; and chroma of 4 through 8 dry and 4 through 6 moist. Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam with clay content averaging 10 to 18 percent.  A Btk horizon is present in over half the pedons and is typically part of the argillic horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam with 10 to 15 percent clay.  Carbonates range from 9 to 20 percent.  This horizon is a diagnostic calcic.  The reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Canwall, Cotha, Elk Mountain, Farson, Means, Rawlins, Rohonda, Ryan Park, and Ryark series.  Canwall soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Cotha, Elk Mountain, Means, and Rohonda soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Farson, Ryan Park and Rawlins soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Joemre soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping relict fan aprons, alluvial fans, and terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  These soils are formed in mixed alluvium derived dominantly from \"redbed\" sedimentary formations.  Elevation is 6,000 to 7,800 feet.   The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches of which about half falls as snow in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is approximately 85 to 110 days."

Tieside soils are shallow to fractured limestone and are on adjacent bedrock remnants.  Rohonda soils are on more convex positions."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: Ochric epipedon - 0 to 2 inches (A);  Argillic horizon - 2 to 13 inches (Bt, Btk);  Calcic horizon - 5 to 60 inches (Btk, Bk).\nThe concept of this series is a mature Haplargid being resaturated with secondary calcium carbonate.  Argillic horizons with strong, coarse, blocky, and prismatic structure are typical, along with abundant carbonate accumulation and discontinuous clay films.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
