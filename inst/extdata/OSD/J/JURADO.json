Minnye soils do not have rock fragments with quartzite lithology and are 25 to 60 cm to the base of the argillic horizon.  Perazzo soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Preatorson soils lack a Bk above the argillic horizon.  Rednik and Zaba soils have an exchangeable sodium percentage that is greater than 15.  Stonell soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

Elevations range from 1,620 to 2,045 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
