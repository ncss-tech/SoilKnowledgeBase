  "OVERVIEW": "The Jenor series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources with a component of loess.  Jenor soils are on calderas and fan piedmont remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
