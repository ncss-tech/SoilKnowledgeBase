  "OVERVIEW": "The Jarita series is a member of the fine-loamy, mixed, mesic family of Pachic Argiustolls. Typically, Jarita soils have dark grayish brown silt loam A horizons, prismatic, brown silty clay loam B2t horizons over limestone at depths of 20 to 40 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 20 to 40 inches thick, with limestone bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Coarse fragments in the control section range from 5 to 35 percent increasing from the surface with depth. Average annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 59 degrees F. These soils are usually dry for more than 90 cumulative days but less than 60 consecutive days in the section from 4 to 12 inches. The periods between October and June are the driest. The solum ranges from neutral to mildly alkaline, increasing in alkalinity from the surface downward. The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry and 2 through 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. The B2t horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 through 3 dry or moist. It is silty clay loam or clay loam containing 18 to 35 percent clay. The carbonates in the lower part of the B2t horizon range from nonvisible finely divided to weak soft lime concretions and thin lime mycelia, increasing with depth. The carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 12 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  The Jarita soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep ridge tops, crests, and saddles of low rolling limestone hills at elevations of 5,800 to 7,000 feet. The parent material is mainly from limestone. These soils occur in semiarid climate. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 to 17 inches with a summer maximum. Mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees to 57 degrees F."
