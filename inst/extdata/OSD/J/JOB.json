Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,400 to 1,645 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 10.5 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 140 days."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 90 and 152 cm (moderately deep and deep free water occurrence classes). Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent. Drainage has been altered in some areas resulting in the water table rising to within 60 cm of the soil surface during spring and early summer. These soils are susceptible to occasional to very rare flooding for brief periods."
