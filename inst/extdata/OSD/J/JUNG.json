Disage soils do not have Btk horizons and have neutral argillic horizons. Grumblen soils have soil temperature that ranges from 12 to 13 degrees C. and have more than 15 percent increase in clay in the Bt horizon. Loomis soils lack a Btk horizon and have bedrock at 20 to 36 cm.  Rocconda soils have a depth to bedrock range from 10 to 36 cm."
