  "OVERVIEW": "The Jung series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from metavolcanic and volcanic rocks. Jung soils are on mountains and hill crests and side slopes. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
