  "REVDATE": "06/2016",
  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Jevets series consists of moderately deep over indurated duripan, well drained soil that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks modified with eolian sands.  Jevets soils are on fan piedmonts and fan skirts.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
