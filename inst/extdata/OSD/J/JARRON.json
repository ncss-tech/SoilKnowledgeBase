    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 44 inches.  Sodium saturation is more than 15 percent in the Bt\nhorizon and increases with depth.  Depth to secondary\naccumulations of calcium carbonate is 12 to 24 inches.\nThe A horizon is gray (10YR 5/1), dark gray (10YR 4/1), grayish\nbrown (10YR 5/2), or dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy clay\nloam or fine sandy loam.  The E horizon is light gray (10YR 7/1, 7/2), gray (10YR 5/1, 6/1), or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2)\nsandy clay loam or fine sandy loam.  The A and E horizons are slightly acid or neutral.  Salinity ranges from 2 to 8 mmhos/cm.\nThe Bt horizon is gray (10YR 5/1) or dark gray (10YR 4/1) sandy\nclay, clay, or clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 50\npercent.  It is slightly acid through moderately alkaline.\nSalinity ranges from 4 to 12 mmhos/cm.  The Bk horizon is grayish brown (10YR 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2), olive gray (5Y 5/2), or brown (10YR\n5/3) clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.  It is moderately alkaline\nor strongly alkaline.  Salinity ranges from 8 to 16 mmhos/cm.\nThe C horizon is very pale brown (10YR 7/3), pale brown (10YR\n6/3), or light gray (5Y 6/1; 2.5Y 7/1, 7/2) sandy clay loam, clay loam, or clay.  Salinity ranges from 10 to 30 mmhos/cm."

Matagorda soils are less saline, lack pending and have a different and more productive native plant community.  Aransas, Edroy, Incell, and Tiocano soils lack an argillic horizon.  In addition, Incell is in a fine-loamy family and Tiocano soils have vertic properties.  Rio soils have less than 15 percent\nexchangeable sodium in the argillic horizon."
