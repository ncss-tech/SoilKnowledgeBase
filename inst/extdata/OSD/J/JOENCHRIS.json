Campcreek soils have Bw horizons above the Bt horizon, have the upper boundary of the argillic horizon at depths of 25 to 50 cm from the soil surface, and have 10 to 25 percent rock fragments in horizons below the argillic horizon.  Carryback, Golars, and Zumwalt soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Crowcamp soils have mollic epipedons that are 50 to 75 cm thick, endosaturation within 100 cm of the soil surface, and a firm, brittle, silica-enriched horizon within 40 inches of the soil surface.  Hankins soils are deep to paralithic contacts and have mollic epipedons that are 50 to 100 cm thick.  Jesh soils have less than 30 percent rock fragments in the 2Btk horizons.  Lacrol soils have episaturation within 50 cm of the soil surface between March and May and have less than 30 percent rock fragments in the 2Btk horizons.  Longbarn soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Tippett soils have albic horizons and less than 30 percent rock fragments in the 2Btk horizons.  Warpaint soils have an aridic moisture regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Joenchris soils are on fan remnants.  They typically occur on summit positions.  They formed in eolian volcanic ash over alluvium derived from volcanic and metavolcanic rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,895 to 2,380 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 410 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."
