  "OVERVIEW": "The Joenchris series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian volcanic ash over alluvium derived from volcanic and metavolcanic rocks.  Joenchris soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.",
