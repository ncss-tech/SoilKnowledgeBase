  "OVERVIEW": "The Jetcop series consists of shallow to duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from basalt with a component of volcanic ash.  Jetcop soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
