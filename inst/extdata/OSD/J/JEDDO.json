    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Blount, Boyer, Lamson, Lenawee, Metamora, Nappanee, Parkhill, Spinks, Toledo, and Wasepi soils. The somewhat poorly drained Blount and Nappanee soils and the poorly drained Parkhill soils are found on similar landscape positions. Parkhill soils do not have argillic horizons. The very poorly drained, finer textured Toledo soils and the Lenawee and coarser textured Lamson soils occupy small lake bed areas within the boundaries of the till plain or occur adjacent to Jeddo soils where the till plains border lake plains. The well drained Boyer and Spinks soils and the somewhat poorly drained Metamora and Wasepi soils have less clay and more sand and commonly occur in the surrounding uplands."
