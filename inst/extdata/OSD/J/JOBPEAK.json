Medved soils have a C horizon with more than 90 percent rock fragments. Mizel soils have a reaction class that is medium acid or slightly acid. Skedaddle soils average 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Smallcone soils have reaction class that is strongly acid or moderately acid. Snaker soils are 25 to 50 cm to bedrock and have rock fragments which are dominantly channers. Tejabe soils are moist in the upper part of the moisture control section for 10 to 20 days cumulative during summer and autumn. Wahguyhe soils are 36 to 50 cm to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevations are 1,707 to 2,347 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
