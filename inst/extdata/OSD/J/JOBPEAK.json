  "OVERVIEW": "The Jobpeak series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Jobpeak soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 50 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",

Medved soils have a C horizon with more than 90 percent rock fragments. Mizel soils have a reaction class that is medium acid or slightly acid. Skedaddle soils average 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Smallcone soils have reaction class that is strongly acid or moderately acid. Snaker soils are 25 to 50 cm to bedrock and have rock fragments which are dominantly channers. Tejabe soils are moist in the upper part of the moisture control section for 10 to 20 days cumulative during summer and autumn. Wahguyhe soils are 36 to 50 cm to bedrock."
