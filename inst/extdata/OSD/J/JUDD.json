Carnero soils have free carbonates of lime-coated pebbles in the Bt horizon. Cueva soils have a paralithic contact between 20 to 40 inch depths. Abrazo, Carnero and Cueva soils have bedrock between 20 and 40 inches. Celsospring soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the Bt. Charette soils are noncalcareous to a depth of 51 inches. Concho soils have calcic horizons. Remunda and Swastika soils have less than 30 percent sand in the Bt horizon."
