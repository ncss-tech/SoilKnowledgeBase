(A1, A2, Bw, Bk horizons)\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 3 inches.  (A1, A2 horizons)\nCambic horizon:  The zone from 3 to 9 inches.  (Bw horizon)\nLithic contact:  The contact with Juana Lopez Limestone at 11 inches.  (R horizon)\nOther features:  The Bk horizon has the properties of a calcic horizon, but lacks the thickness to qualify.\nThis soil does not classify as an Aridisol because the lower boundary of the cambic horizon does not extend below 10 inches.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Calcium carbonate amounts were determined with a field calcimeter.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
