  "OVERVIEW": "The Jaralosa series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from micaceous sandstone and siltstone over alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist.  Jaralosa soils are on flood plains and point bars of valley floors with intermittent streams.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
