The soil moisture control sections of these soils are driest in May and June.  The soil moisture regime is ustic bordering on aridic.  The lower 2C horizon is saturated with ground water for at least one month in most years.  Water within the capillary fringe moistens horizons above the upper boundary of saturation.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jaralosa soils are on narrow flood plains and point bars of valley floors with intermittent streams.  They formed in alluvium derived from Tertiary micaceous sandstone and siltstone over alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist..  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,300 to 7,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 170 days."

Bosquecito soils are coarse-loamy, have seasonal high water tables between 2 and 3.5 feet, and occur on low flood plains.  Cuyamungue soils are sandy-skeletal, have seasonal high water tables between 5 and 8 feet, and occur on low flood plains below Jaralosa.  Mirada soils are coarse-loamy, have seasonal high water tables near the soil surface, and occur on low flood plains."
