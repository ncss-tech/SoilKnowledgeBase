Depth to fractured bedrock ranges from 18 to 60 inches, usually 20 to 36 inches.  The A1 horizons range in color from light gray to grayish brown (10YR 6/1, 6/2, 5/3, 5/2; 2.5Y 6/2, 5/1) dry and dark grayish brown to dark brown moist; in texture from gravelly sandy loam to gravelly loam and in reaction from neutral to strongly acid.  The A3 horizon is medium to very strongly acid.  The B2 horizons range in color from pale brown to very pale brown, light gray and white (10YR) dry and pale brown to grayish brown moist; in texture from gravelly sandy loam to gravelly sandy clay loam and in reaction from medium acid to strongly acid."
