  "OVERVIEW": "The Jalmar series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils. These soils formed in sandy and loamy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. Jalmar soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping plains and interdunes. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in), and mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C. (61 degrees F).",
