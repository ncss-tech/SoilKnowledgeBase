  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and to a densic contact with till ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the  loamy mantle typically ranges from 15 to 22 inches but in some pedons it is as thick as 30 inches.  Clay content averages 18 to 25 percent in the particle-size control section.  Reaction naturally ranges from strongly aid to slightly acid in the loamy mantle but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed. Reaction is stromgly acid or moderately acid in the till. The silty and loamy mantle generally has few (<2 percent) to no coarse fragments.  Volume of gravel ranges from 2 to 10 percent in the till.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the till subsoil and from 0 to 10 percent in the substratum.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR  and value and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, and value and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; and value and chroma of 3 to 6.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. Texture is loam or sandy loam.\nThe 2Cd horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is typically sandy loam, but in some pedons it is loam."

These soils formed in a mantle of wind or water laid loamy deposits and in the underlying reddish dense loamy till.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F."

In nearby areas, where the loess or loamy deposit is less than 15 inches thick, are the well drained Amery soils.  The well drained Santiago and the moderately well drained Freeon soils are in similar landscape positions.  The Freer soils contain grayer colors in the matrix."
