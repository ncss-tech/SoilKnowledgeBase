  "OVERVIEW": "The Juratrias series consists of very shallow to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from metamorphic materials. Juratrias soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 56 degrees F.",
