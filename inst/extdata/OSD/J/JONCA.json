  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Jonca series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils with a fragipan formed in a thin layer of loess, collvuium, and the underlying residuum weathered from sandstone on uplands. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and slow within the fragipan. Slopes range from 2 to 9 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, and average annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum is 56 to over 80 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 60 to more than 100 inches.  Depth to the fragipan is 24 to 40 inches, and is  about 10 to 30 inches thick.  Rock fragments larger than 3 inches in size average about 5 percent of the mass and are only present below the fragipan.  Rock fragments less than 3 inches in size are absent above the fragipan and average 0 to 15 percent within and below the fragipan.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam unless eroded, in which case it is silty clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid to medium acid, and ranges to neutral where limed.\nThe BA or E horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is clay loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam and averages between 27 and 35 percent clay and 15 to 25 percent sand.  It is extremely strongly acid to strongly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon and 2Btx horizons have hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Mottles have hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The 2Bt horizon is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam and the 2Btx horizon is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sand clay loam.  Reaction for both horizons range from extremely acid to strongly acid.  Some pedons have a 2E'2 or 3Bt horizon above the fragipan.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sandy loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.  It has a significant accumulation of translocated clays in the form of distinct clay films."

Gatton soils have a fragipan at 20 to 30 inches.  Homewood soils have glacial erratics. Readington soils have hues redder than 7.5YR in the B2 horizon.  Wooster soils have coarse fragments throughout the solum.  In addition, Wooster soils lack low chroma mottles above the fragipan."
