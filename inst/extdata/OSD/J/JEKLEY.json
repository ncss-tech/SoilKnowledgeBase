  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Jekley series are moderately deep to deep, reddish, well drained, and moderately fine textured. They are noncalcareous and neutral to slightly alkaline. They developed in residuum weathered from sandstone and shale of the Abo formation. They occur on north-facing slopes on very strongly sloping to very steep side slopes",
