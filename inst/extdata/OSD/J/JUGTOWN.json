    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Content of clay in the control section is 15 to 30 percent.  Sandstone, chert, and shale rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the surface, 0 to 25 percent in the solum, and 5 to 75 percent in the substratum.  Content of rock fragments in the control section is less than 15 percent.  In unlimed areas, soil reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral in the upper solum and from slightly acid to mildly alkaline in the lower solum and substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium, granular or subangular blocky.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is clay loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, and loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 7, `and chroma of 1 to 6.

The Bogart soils formed in outwash materials.  Centerburg soils formed in glacial till or moraines of medium lime content.  The Conowingo soils have serpentine in the lower part of the solum and have bedrock at depths less than 60 inches.  The Haney soils have free carbonates ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  Lehigh soils contain channery fragments of procelainite in the B horizon and have bedrock at depths less than 60 inches. Mount Lucas soils have angular fragments of diabase and quartzite throughout the solum.  Reaville soils have bedrock within a 20 to 40 inch depth.  Thackery soils have carbonates in the lower part of the solum.  Tuscola soils lack rock fragments.  Vaughnsville soils overlie fine textured material within a depth of 40 inches.  Williamstown soils have formed in till."

The soils are formed in alluvium derived from calcareous shale, sandstone, and limestone sedimentary rocks.  Mean annual precipitation is 38 to 45 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 50 to 54 degrees.  The number of frost-free days range from 120 to 160."
