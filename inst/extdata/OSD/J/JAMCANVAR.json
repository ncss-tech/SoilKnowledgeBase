  "OVERVIEW": "The Jamcanvar series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed alluvium derived from mixed rocks and hot spring deposits. The Jamcanvar soils are on stream terraces. Slopes are 2 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
