  "OVERVIEW": "The Jaegie series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from gniess, schist, sedimentary and igneous rock.  These soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
