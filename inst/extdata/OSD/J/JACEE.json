  "OVERVIEW": "The Jacee series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from interbedded shale and sandstones on bedrock controlled plains, mesa tops, and small alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
