    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the volcanic ash influence is 10 to 20 inches, and has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.40 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 80 percent rock fragments and 2 to 6 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has values of 4 or 5 dry, 2 to 4 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has chromas of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is ashy sandy loam, gravelly ashy sandy loam, very gravelly ashy sandy loam, or very cobbly ashy sandy loam.  It has 10 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.\nThe 2C horizons has hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, very cobbly sandy loam, or extremely cobbly coarse sandy loam.  It has 30 to 50 percent gravel, 0 to 30 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent stones.\nThe 3C horizon has hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is extremely gravelly loamy sand or extremely cobbly loamy sand.  It has 45 to 55 percent gravel, 20 to 30 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones."

These soils formed in alluvium and till from sedimentary and volcanic rock sources with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 24 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 22 to 26 degrees F.; the average July temperature ranges from 62 to 67 degrees F.; and the average annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
