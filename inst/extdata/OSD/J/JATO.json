  "OVERVIEW": "The Jato series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in gypsiferous lacustrine deposits. These nearly level soils are on relict lakebeds and level interdunes on basin floors. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
