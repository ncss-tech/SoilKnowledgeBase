  "OVERVIEW": "The Jabu series very deep, well drained soils that formed in outwash and alluvium from granitic sources. Jabu soils are on glacial outwash terraces and moraines and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 760 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
