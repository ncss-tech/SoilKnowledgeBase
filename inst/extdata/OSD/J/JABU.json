    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jabu soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep glacial outwash, moraines, and terraces at elevations of 1890 to 2260 meters. They formed in coarse textured alluvium derived mainly from granitic sources. The climate is cool continental. Mean annual precipitation is about 580 to 1040 inches. The mean annual temperature is 5 degrees C., mean January temperature is -3 degrees C., and the mean July temperature is 16 degrees C. The frost-free season is less than 100 days."
