  "OVERVIEW": "The Jemco series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over residuum derived from sandstone.  Jemco soils are on mesas and hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
