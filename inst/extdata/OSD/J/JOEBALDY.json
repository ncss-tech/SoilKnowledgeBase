  "OVERVIEW": "The Joebaldy series consists of soils that are moderately deep to fragmental material.  They are well drained soils on high elevation mountain ridges.  They formed in material weathered from talus and colluvium from metasedimentary rock with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and very rapid in the substratum.  Slope ranges from 10 to 50 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 50 inches.",
