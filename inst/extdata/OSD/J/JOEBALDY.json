These soils formed in material weathered from talus and colluvium from metasedimentary rock, with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Elevations range from 5200 to 6300 feet.   The average annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F, average annual precipitation is 45 to 55 inches, and frost-free season is from 30 to 60 days."
