The soil is effervescent and moderately alkaline throughout.  The calcium carbonate equivalent of the control section ranges from 8 to 20 percent.  Fragments of mainly dolomitic limestone less than 3 cm across long axis range from 0 to 10 percent throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Mollic layers are less than 9 inches thick.  Nonmollic A2 horizons are present in some pedons.  Texture is silty clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4.  Texture is loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bk1 and Bk2 horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam or silt loam.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aspermont, Burford, and Obaro soils in the same family.  Soils in similar families include the Enterprise, Gotebo, Shep, Weymouth, Wise and Woodward soils.  Aspermont and Burford soils have sola less than 60 inches thick.  Obaro soils are underlain by soft sandstone.  Enterprise, Gotebo and Woodward soils have coarse-silty particle-size control sections and Gotebo and Woodward soils have soft parent material at 20 to 40 inch depths.  Shep and Weymouth soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections and sola less than 60 inches.  Wise soils have siliceous mineralogy and soft parent material at 20 to 40 inch depths."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jaywi soils are on gently sloping uplands.  Slopes are convex and range from 1 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in calcareous stream terrace and colluvial deposits from receding chalky limestones and shales of the Blaine Formation (Permian age).  Most areas are dissected by streams or border flood plains.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 21 to 25 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 62 to 64 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from 1200 to 1850 feet.  Frost free days range from 210 to 220.  Thornthwaite P-E indices range is 32 to 37."

Aspermont soils are on elevations higher than the Jaywi soils.  Cottonwood, Knoco and Talpa soils are on higher elevations and have bedrock or weathered shale at very shallow or shallow depths.  Tilvern and Vernon soils are on higher elevations, have sola less than 60 inches and have fine particle-size control sections.  Quanah soils are on less sloping areas and have a mollic epipedon.  Westill soils are on stream divides, have a mollic surface and fine particle-size control sections.  Wheatwood soils are on floodplains and have stratified layers."
