  "OVERVIEW": "The Jules series consists of deep, well drained or moderately well drained soils formed in calcareous, stratified silty alluvium.  They are on alluvial fans or flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 11.7 degrees C (53 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches).",

Other similar soils are Arenzville, Bold, Chaseburg, Dorchester, Haymond, Haynie, and McPaul series.  Arenzville, Chaseburg, and Haymond soils are noncalcareous.  Bold soils are not stratified.  Dorchester soils contain more clay in the control section.  Haynie and McPaul soils have darker surface horizons."

Landes and Sarpy soils contain more sand in the control section and are on natural levees or low rises on the flood plains.  Lawson soils have a mollic epipedon and contain more clay.  They are on lower parts of the flood plain nearby.  Wakeland soils are Aeric Fluvaquents and are on lower parts of the flood plain nearby."
