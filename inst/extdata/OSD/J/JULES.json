Jules soils formed in relatively unaltered stratified, calcareous alluvium washed from soils formed in loess on nearby uplands.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 13.3 degrees C (50 to 56 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 838 to 1118 mm (33 to 44 inches)."

Arenzville, Dorchester and Haymond soils are on similar parts of the flood plains nearby.  Landes and Sarpy soils contain more sand in the control section and are on natural levees or low rises on the flood plains.  Lawson soils have a mollic epipedon and contain more clay.  They are on lower parts of the flood plain nearby.  Wakeland soils are Aeric Fluvaquents and are on lower parts of the flood plain nearby."
