The surface is covered with 30 percent gravel, 40 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones and 2 percent boulders.\nA--0 to 10 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3), moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and medium roots; many very fine to medium interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel and 35 cobbles; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline, (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (8 to 25 cm thick)\nR--10 cm; extremely hard tufa."

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture: Usually moist for short periods in winter and early spring, dry in late spring through early fall; typic aridic moisture regime.\nMean annual soil temperature: 12 to 14 degrees C.\nDepth to bedrock: 8 to 25 cm to a lithic contact.  The lithic materials are bedded layers of tufa.  Tufa is a chemical sedimentary rock composed of calcium carbonate and silica and deposited from solution in the water of springs adjacent to lakes.\nReaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 4 to 10 percent.\nRock fragments: Averages more than 60 percent gravel and cobbles.  Lithology of fragments is tufa and mixed rocks including volcanic and granitic.\nA horizon\nValue: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nBk or C horizons\nPresent in some pedons.\nR layer\nLithic materials composed of lithoid or dendritic tufa with some fine-earth in cracks and pockets. Thin plates of harder travertine or thinolite tufa may be present in some pedons.\nOther features: Material including lake deposits and bedrock may be present below the lithic contact; other layers of tufa may be present between uncemented lake deposits ranging from silt loam to cobbles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jacaranda soils are on lake terraces associated with Lake Lahontan and other Pleistocene lakes.  They formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks and tufa deposits.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1250 to 1335 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 12 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."
