  "OVERVIEW": "The Jackmill series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and slope alluvium from rhyolite, quartzite and sandstone with loess influence.  Jackmill soils are on fan remnants and have slopes of 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 1.4 degrees C.",
