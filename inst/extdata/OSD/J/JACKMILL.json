The Basinpeak soils have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Berrycreek, Lag, Sheepshrub, Timmercrek,and Wareagle soils have an O horizon.  Decram, Foxmount, Krackle, Middlehill, and Rockabin soils are moderately deep.  Fairydell soils have 20 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are slighty to strongly effervescent in the lower part of the subsoil and substratum.  Gaia and Sup soils lack a cambic horizon and the silica accumulation.  Klug soils lack the silica accumulation and the coarse textured (coarse sand or loamy sand) in the lower part of the particle-size control section."
