  "OVERVIEW": "The Jackrabbit series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sands deposits.  These soils occur on dunes, dune fields, and interdunes. Slopes are 1 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 390 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
