  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 44 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually saturated from January through June but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 30 to 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Depth to the seasonal high water table in winter and early spring is 0.5 feet to 2.0 feet below the mineral soil surface.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 16 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section contains an average of 25 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser with 0 to 3 percent coarse fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.\nThe 2Btg1 and 2Btg2 horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.  They are silt loam or silty clay loam, and are 0 to 3 percent pebbles.\nThe 2Btg3 horizon has hue of 2 .5Y or 5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2, dry or moist.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay and is 0 to 5 percent pebbles."

These soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments and recent alluvium mixed with volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  Elevations range from 1,600 to 3,100 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 16 to 18 inches. The mean January temperature is about 23 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."
