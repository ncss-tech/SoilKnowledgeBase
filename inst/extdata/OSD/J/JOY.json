    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nmollic epipedon: from a depth of 0 to 43 cm (0 to 17 inches) (Ap, A1, and A2 horizons)\ncambic horizon: from a depth of 43 to 124 cm (17 to 49 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Btg horizons);\nParticle-size control section: from a depth of 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 inches) (A1, A2, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Btg horizons);\nSeries control section: from a depth of 0 to 152 cm (0 to 60 inches) (Ap, A1, A2, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btg, and Cg horizons);\nMost cambic horizons in these soils have few or common, faint clay films on the faces of peds. The increase in clay content is not enough to meet criteria for an argillic horizon. Data for this pedon (78IL-073-094) indicates the greatest increase in clay is 14 percent.\nThese soils formed in loess near a major loess source. Very fine sandy loam and loam textures are allowed in the substratum because the loess here is relatively coarse and may contain a high content of very fine sand.\nA sandy substratum phase with loamy sand or sand textures was previously recognized. These soils are now within the concept of the Joyce series."
