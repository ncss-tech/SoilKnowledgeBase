  "OVERVIEW": "The Jipper series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and eolian sands over basalt.  Jipper soils are on smooth and concave positions on lava flows on lava fields.  Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C. and the mean annual precipitation is about 381 millimeters.",
