  "OVERVIEW": "The Janile series consists of moderately deep, somewhat\nexcessively drained soils formed in material weathered from\ngranite.  Janile soils are on mountain sideslopes.  Slopes range\nfrom 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
