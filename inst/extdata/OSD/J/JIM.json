Reaction throughout the profile ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid with pH greater than 5.5 (H20,1:1) in some part of the control section.\nThe A horizon has hue ranging from 7.5YR to 2.5Y; value moist from 3 to 5; and chroma moist from 1 to 3.\nThe C horizons have hue ranging from 10YR to 5Y; value moist from 3 to 5; and chroma moist from 2 to 4."
