  "OVERVIEW": "The Jim series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess overlying metamorphic bedrock.  Jim soils are on footslopes and sideslopes of mountains.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",

The weighted average particle size of the control section has less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid with pH greater than 5.5 (H20,1:1) in some part of the control section.\nThe A horizon has hue ranging from 7.5YR to 2.5Y; value moist from 3 to 5; and chroma moist from 1 to 3.\nThe C horizons have hue ranging from 10YR to 5Y; value moist from 3 to 5; and chroma moist from 2 to 4."
