    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Hazeldell, Olympic, and Seaquest series.  Hazeldell soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have hue of 10YR to 5YR throughout the solum.  Olympic soils have an umbric epipedon.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Jory soils are on foothills adjacent to the Willamette and Umpqua Valleys.  Slopes are 2 to 90 percent but are typically less than 60 percent.  The soils occur at elevations of 250 to 2,500 feet.  The soils formed in clayey colluvium and residuum derived mainly from basic igneous materials and secondarily from tuffaceous and sedimentary materials.  The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F. The mean January temperature is about 39 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is about 67 degrees F. The frost-free season is 160 to 235 days."

Bellpine soils are 20 to 40 inches to weathered sediments and occur on the convex positions of hillslopes.  Cottrell soils have redox depletions in the upper part of the argillic horizon and occur on concave positions. Dupee soils have redox depletions within 30 inches of the soil surface and occur on concave positions.  Gelderman soils are 20 to 40 inches to weathered basalt and occur on convex positions of the hillslope. MacDunn soils are clayey-skeletal and occur on the more steeply sloping positions of hillslopes.  Nekia soils are 20 to 40 inches to hard basalt and are on convex positions of hillslopes.  Price soils lack argillic horizons and occur on the more steeply sloping positions of hillslopes.  Ritner soils are clayey-skeletal, 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock and occur on convex positions of hillslopes. Saum soils lack argillic horizons and are on steeply sloping positions of hillslopes."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - moist chroma of 4\nArgillic horizon - 19 to 100 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons)\nField textures in the Bt horizons are silty clay loam. Particle-size analysis is clay or silty clay. The clay minerals are strong in kaolinite but are not dominant.\nPale feature - clay content does not decrease with depth.\nBase saturation is less than 35 percent throughout the lower part of the argillic horizon.\nSoil moisture regime - xeric.\nThis soil series was officially recognized by the State of Oregon as the state soil on May 23, 2011.  The Jory series is a benchmark soil.\nThis soil was previously classified as a Xeric Haplohumults. The bedrock substratum phase of this series when associated with sediments is correlated to the Windygap series. Some pedons have boulders as much as 5 feet in diameter.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for profile S55Oreg-24-6(1-8). Published in Soil Survey of Marion County Area, Oregon, 1972. Other data includes National Soil Survey Lab soil survey sample numbers S60OR-047-007, S55OR-047-005, S55OR-047-006, S55OR-003-002, S83OR-019-001, S83OR-019-002, S55OR-019-002, 01OR-053-001, 01OR-071-009, 01OR-071-010, 01OR-071-011, 01OR-047-001, 01OR-047-002, 02OR-067-001, 02OR-047-001, 03OR-005-001, 03OR-005-002, and 03OR-071-003 .\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
