  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Jarboe series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived from limestone, shale, tuff andesite, basalt and sandstone.  Jarboe soils are on concave basins or lake-formed terraces.  Slopes are less than 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jarboe soils are concave basins or lake-formed terraces at elevations of 1,370 to 1,680 meters.  Slopes are less than 1 percent. The soils formed in lacustrine materials derived from mixed rocks including limestone, shale, tuff, andesite, basalt and sandstone. These materials have been modified by carbonate precipitated from evaporating ground water. The climate is cool, semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of 150 to 200 mm. The mean annual temperature 11 to 13 degrees C and the average frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."

Aysees soils have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections; Cliffdown soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections; and Kawich soils have sandy particle-size control sections. Papoose soils have sandy clay loam argillic horizons. Timper soils have indurated duripans."

Evaporation of the lake waters and subsequent lowering of the water table has improved the natural drainage. Very slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity."
