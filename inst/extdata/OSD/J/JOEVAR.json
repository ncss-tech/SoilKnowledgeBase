  "REVDATE": "10/2002",
  "STATES": "ID,OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Joevar series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in silty alluvium derived dominantly from loess.  Permeability is moderate.  These soils are on terraces and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Bear Lake and Downata soils are very poorly drained and have fine-silty control sections.  Hondoho soils are loamy-skeletal.  Inkom soils are poorly drained and are fine-silty.  Lanoak soils have pachic epipedons.  Rexburg and Ririe soils have mollic epipedons.  Arbone and Hondoho soils are on fan terraces and terrace escarpments adjacent to the Joevar soils.  Bear Lake, Downata, and Inkom soils occupy lower terraces that are less well drained than the Joevar soils.  Lanoak, Rexburg, and Ririe soils are on loess covered fan terraces above the Joevar soils."
