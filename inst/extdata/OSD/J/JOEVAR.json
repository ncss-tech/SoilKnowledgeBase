    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Joevar soils are on terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  They formed in silty alluvium derived dominantly from loess.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches, and the average annual temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 75 to 100 days.  Elevation ranges from 4,500 to 5,400 feet."

Bear Lake and Downata soils are very poorly drained and have fine-silty control sections.  Hondoho soils are loamy-skeletal.  Inkom soils are poorly drained and are fine-silty.  Lanoak soils have pachic epipedons.  Rexburg and Ririe soils have mollic epipedons.  Arbone and Hondoho soils are on fan terraces and terrace escarpments adjacent to the Joevar soils.  Bear Lake, Downata, and Inkom soils occupy lower terraces that are less well drained than the Joevar soils.  Lanoak, Rexburg, and Ririe soils are on loess covered fan terraces above the Joevar soils."
