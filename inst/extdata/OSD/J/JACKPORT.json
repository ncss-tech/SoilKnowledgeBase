  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 50 to more than 72 inches.  Cracks 1-3 cm wide extend from the surface to depths of 20 to 40 inches during dry periods.  Clay content of the 10 to 40 inch control section, typically ranges from 50 to 60 percent.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A horizon and is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the Bg and upper Bssg and moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the lower Bssg and B'g horizons and slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the BCg and C horizons.\nThe Ap has hue of 10YR, value of  4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Iron accumulations are in shades of brown.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.\nThe Bg and Bssg horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades in red, brown and gray.  Texture is clay, silty clay and silty clay loam in the lower part.\nThe B'g and BCg horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of gray or brown.  Texture is silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe C horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of gray or brown.  Texture is variable, but dominantly silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in clayey alluvium.  The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F. near the type location."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Amagon, Foley, Grubbs and Overcup series.  Amagon soils occur on lower terraces and contain less clay and do not have vertic properties.  Foley soils occur on similar landscapes and contain less clay and have a natric horizon.  Grubbs soils occur on the margin of higher terraces and on escarpments between terraces and are better drained, contain less clay and do not have vertic properties.  Overcup soils occur on similar landscapes and have an abrupt texture change between the ochric epipedon and an underlying argillic horizon."
