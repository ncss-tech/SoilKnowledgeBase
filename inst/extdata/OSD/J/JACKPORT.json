Clay content of the 10 to 40 inch control section, typically ranges from 50 to 60 percent.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A horizon and is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the Bg and upper Bssg and moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the lower Bssg and B'g horizons and slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the BCg and C horizons.\nThe Ap has hue of 10YR, value of  4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Iron accumulations are in shades of brown.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.\nThe Bg and Bssg horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades in red, brown and gray.  Texture is clay, silty clay and silty clay loam in the lower part.\nThe B'g and BCg horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of gray or brown.  Texture is silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe C horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.

Amagon soils occur on lower terraces and contain less clay and do not have vertic properties.  Foley soils occur on similar landscapes and contain less clay and have a natric horizon.  Grubbs soils occur on the margin of higher terraces and on escarpments between terraces and are better drained, contain less clay and do not have vertic properties.  Overcup soils occur on similar landscapes and have an abrupt texture change between the ochric epipedon and an underlying argillic horizon."
