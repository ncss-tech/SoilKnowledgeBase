These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The volcanic ash mantle is 7 to 14 inches thick and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.80 to 1.00 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable iron of more than 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 65 percent rock fragments.\nThe C horizon has values of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chromas of 1 or 2 dry. It is absent in some pedons.\nThe 2A horizon has chromas of 3 or 4 dry or moist. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bw horizon has chroma of 3 to 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist. It is stony ashy sandy loam or gravelly ashy sandy loam. It has 10 to 30 percent pebbles, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, and 0 to 15 percent stones. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is very stony loamy sand, very cobbly loamy sand, or extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand. It has 20 to 60 percent pebbles, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 20 percent stones."

These soils formed in till and some outwash from granitic rock with a mantle of volcanic ash 7 to 14 inches thick. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, moist summers. The average annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 40 inches. The mean January temperature is about 20 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 58 degrees F, and the average annual air temperature is about 35 to 40 degrees F. The frost-free period is 60 to 85 days."
