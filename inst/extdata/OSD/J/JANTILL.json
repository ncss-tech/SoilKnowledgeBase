  "REVDATE": "05/2008",
  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Jantill series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in till and some glacial outwash from granitic rock with a mantle of volcanic ash 7 to 14 inches thick. These soils are on north-facing backslopes and footslopes of glaciated mountains. Slopes are 15 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is 37 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The average annual soil temperature is 37 to 42 degrees F. The average annual summer soil temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F. These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The volcanic ash mantle is 7 to 14 inches thick and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.80 to 1.00 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable iron of more than 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 65 percent rock fragments.\nThe C horizon has values of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chromas of 1 or 2 dry. It is absent in some pedons.\nThe 2A horizon has chromas of 3 or 4 dry or moist. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bw horizon has chroma of 3 to 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist. It is stony ashy sandy loam or gravelly ashy sandy loam. It has 10 to 30 percent pebbles, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, and 0 to 15 percent stones. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is very stony loamy sand, very cobbly loamy sand, or extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand. It has 20 to 60 percent pebbles, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 20 percent stones."
