  "OVERVIEW": "The Junction series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from sandstone and shale.  The Junction soils are on alluvial fans, floodplains, and desert valleys.  Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches.",
