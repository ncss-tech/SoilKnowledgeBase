  "OVERVIEW": "The Junaluska series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on ridges and side slopes of the Southern Appalachian Mountains.  They formed in residuum that is affected by soil creep in the upper part, and is weathered from low grade metasedimentary rocks, such as phyllite, slate, and low grade, thinly bedded metasandstone.  Slope ranges from 3 to 95 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches near the type location.",

Where present, the C/B horizon consists of thin parallel layers of saprolite and Bt horizon material that has formed along the fracture planes.  It is reddish in color and the C and B parts have the texture range stated for these horizons.\nThe Cr horizon is multicolored, weathered and fractured, low grade metasedimentary rock, such as phyllite, slate, and low grade, thinly bedded metasandstone.

Ashe and Chestnut soils are coarse-loamy, lack Bt horizons, and have granite or gneiss bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Arcola soils formed from siltstone and sandstone in the Piedmont Plateau and contain fragments of those rocks.  Cowee soils formed from igneous and high grade metamorphic rocks such as granite, gneiss, and hornblende gneiss, and contain fragments of those rocks.  Gilpin soils have soft bedrock of sandstone, siltstone, or shale 20 to 40 inches below the surface.  None of the other competing series have bedrock within a depth of 20 to 40 inches.\nNote: The above section has not been updated to reflect the 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy."

Slopes are typically 15 to 50 percent but range from 3 to 95 percent.  Junaluska soils formed in residuum that is affected by soil creep in the upper part, and is weathered from metasedimentary rocks, such as phyllite, slate, thinly bedded metasandstone, and quartzite.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches near the type location."

All of these soils except for Brasstown and Tsali have a cambic horizon.  Also, they are all on ridges and side slopes except for Santeetlah and Spivey which are in coves.  Cataska and Tsali soils are shallow to paralithic contact with a Cr horizon.  Cataska, Spivey, and Sylco soils are loamy-skeletal.  Santeetlah, Spivey, and Stecoah are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock.  This soil is usually mapped in complex with Brasstown or Tsali soils."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Junaluska series describes soils that were previously mapped in the Sylco series.  However, Junaluska soils have an argillic horizon and average less than 35 percent by volume rock fragments. The 6/99 revision updates the classification to the 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy.  The soil is placed in the subactive CEC activity class based upon NSSL lab data from the typifying pedon.\nLaboratory data from the typifying pedon were obtained from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, sample number S85NC-039-003.\nThis soil has the following diagnostic horizons and features:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 13 inches (Oi, A1 and A2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 13 to 23 inches below the surface (Bt horizon)\nParalithic contact - the occurrence of weathered bedrock at a depth of 28 inches.  (The upper boundary of the Cr horizon)\nMLRA = 130 SIR = NC0181"
