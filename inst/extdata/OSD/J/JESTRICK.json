  "OVERVIEW": "The Jestrick series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in eolian and alluvial deposits.  Jestrick soils are on basalt plains and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
