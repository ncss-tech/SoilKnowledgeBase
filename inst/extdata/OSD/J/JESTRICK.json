(6 to 8 inches thick)\n2Bkqm--22 to 29 inches; white (10YR 8/2) indurated duripan, gray (10YR 6/2) moist; starting at 22 inches is a series of continuous laminar caps less than one millimeter thick; these laminar caps are spaced 0.5 to 2 inches apart and the material between them is strongly cemented to indurated; few very fine and fine roots matted on top of the laminar cap; about 10 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles cemented in the duripan; abrupt wavy boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)\n3R--29 inches; basalt- continuous lime-silica cemented laminar cap 1 to 2mm thick on top of the basalt."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jestrick soils occur on basalt plains. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Elevation ranges from 3,200 to 4,000 feet.  The Jestrick soils formed in eolian and alluvial material derived from mixed sources.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 11 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rain.  The average annual air temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 140 days."
