It is silt loam or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam, loam, silty clay, or silt loam.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay loam, clay, or silty clay averaging between 35 and 60 percent clay.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Accumulations of salts are in the lower part of most pedons.\nThe Bkz horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silty clay, clay, or clay loam. Accumulations of gypsum, salts and carbonate range from few to many and fine or medium.  The Bkz horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 1 to 4.  Most pedons have redox features below depth of 30 inches.  The C horizon is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Shale fragments are common in the lower part of the C horizon in some pedons."
