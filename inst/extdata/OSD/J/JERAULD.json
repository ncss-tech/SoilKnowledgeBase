  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates is 6 to 25 inches. The natric horizon typically has ESP greater than 15 or SAR greater than 13 but ranges from 10 to 25.  Some pedons have A1 horizons 1 to 2 inches thick.\nThe A1 horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam, loam, silty clay, or silt loam.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay loam, clay, or silty clay averaging between 35 and 60 percent clay.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Accumulations of salts are in the lower part of most pedons.\nThe Bkz horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silty clay, clay, or clay loam. Accumulations of gypsum, salts and carbonate range from few to many and fine or medium.  The Bkz horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 1 to 4.  Most pedons have redox features below depth of 30 inches.  The C horizon is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Shale fragments are common in the lower part of the C horizon in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Jerauld soils are nearly level to gently sloping on plane or slightly concave slopes of glacial till plains that have slight microrelief.  Jerauld soils formed in clay loam glacial till or in local clayey alluvium underlain by glacial till.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 17 to 24 inches."

Beadle and Lane soils do not have a natric horizon and are on flats between the small depressions.  Cavo, DeGrey, Demky, Dudley, and Stickney soils do not have visible salts above depths of 16 inches and all are in the same landscapes.  The well drained Clarno, Glenham, and Houdek soils are fine-loamy.  These soils are on the plane to convex rises in the landscape."
