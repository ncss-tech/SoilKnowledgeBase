  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is about 34 to 55 inches thick and soil temperature is about 63 to 66 degrees F.  Mineralogy is mixed and the soils are dry during the summer months of most years in the soil between depths of 4 and 12 or more inches.  The A horizons have colors in the 2.5Y hue with values of 5 or 6 dry and 3 moist.  Chromas are 2 or 3.  Textures usually are fine sandy loam with sandy loam and scattered gravels in some pedons.  Structure is very weak or the soils are massive.  Consistence is slightly hard or hard, friable and nonsticky and nonplastic.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.  The Bt horizons have colors with hues of 10YR and 2.5Y, values of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist and chromas of 2 or 3.  Textures are heavy fine sandy loams or light fine sandy clay loams.  The soils are massive but break to weak or moderate coarse angular blocky structure.  Consistence is very hard to hard, friable to firm and slightly sticky and slightly plastic.  Reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline."

The Burchell soils have calcareous silty clay loam Bt horizons and the Coarsegold soils have reddish brown gravelly clay loam Bt horizons and weathered bedrock at 38 inches.  The Los Robles soils have brown clay loam textures throughout, and the Marguerite soils have neutral, heavy loam Bt horizons that are 32 inches thick.  Oakdale soils have friable, slightly acid Bt horizons and a gradual AB boundary.  Ojai soils have reddish brown Bt horizons and are very gravelly and cobbly below 36 inches.  Pinole soils have thick (36 inch) medium acid brown Bt horizons, and the Pleasanton soils have more than 1 percent organic matter in the A horizons.  Sobrante soils have yellowish red Bt horizons.  Whitney soils have light yellowish brown, thin (9 inch) Bt horizons and the Wyo soils have silt loam A horizons and calcareous B3 horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Jacinto soils occur on low, gently undulating ridges near old abandoned stream beds.  Underlying alluvium is wind modified and was derived from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks.  They occur at elevations below 250 feet, in a dry subhumid mesothermal climate with mean annual rainfall of 15 to 25 inches, with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F., average January temperature about 45 degrees F., and average July temperature about 83 degrees F.  Frost-free season averages about 265 days."
