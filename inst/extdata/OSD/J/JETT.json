  "OVERVIEW": "The Jett series consists of deep, well drained soils on\nflood plains.  They formed in mixed alluvium with an\ninfluence of volcanic ash.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3\npercent.  The mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F,\nand the mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.",

The soils are usually moist but are\ndry between depths of 4 to 12 inches for at least 60\nconsecutive days following the summer solstice.  The soil is\ngreater than 60 inches deep.  The mollic epipedon is more\nthan 20 inches thick, and the organic matter content of the\nmixed upper 7 inches is estimated to be more than 3.5\npercent and decreases irregularly with increasing depth.\nThe soil is neutral to moderately alkaline in the A horizon\nand mildly to moderately alkaline below.  It is calcareous\nin all or in some part of the A horizon and decreases in\nlime content with increasing depth.  The particle-size\ncontrol section is silt loam and averages 18 to 27 percent\nclay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry and\nchroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe C horizon has value of 2 through 4 moist and 4 through 6\ndry and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  Some pedons\nhave faint fine mottles in the C horizon below a depth of 40\ninches.  It is silt loam to a depth of 50 inches or more but\nsome pedons grade to silty clay loam below this depth."
