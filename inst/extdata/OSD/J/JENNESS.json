  "OVERVIEW": "The Jenness series consists of very deep, well drained soils on\nbottomlands, low terraces, and alluvial fans.  They formed in alluvium\nand colluvium from acid igneous rocks.  Permeability is moderate.\nSlopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about\n10 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
