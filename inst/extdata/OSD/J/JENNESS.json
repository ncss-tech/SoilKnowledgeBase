Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations\nrange from 2,000 to 4,000 feet.  The soil formed in micaceous, recent\nlocal alluvium and colluvium from acid and intermediate igneous rocks.\nThe average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, including 1 to 2\nfeet of snow.  Average annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The\nfrost-free period is 110 to 160 days."
