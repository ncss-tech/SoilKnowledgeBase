    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to semi-consolidated rock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Content of pebbles and cobbles range from 0 to 10 percent.  Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe AB horizon, where present, has the same colors and content of rock fragments as the A horizon.  Texture is clay.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Content of pebbles and cobbles range from 0 to 50 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has colors and content of rock fragments as the Bw horizon.  Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Content of pebbles and cobbles range from 0 to 50 percent, by volume.  Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Cr horizon consists of highly weathered, semi-consolidated bedded volcanic rock.  In places, secondary lime occurs as coatings along cleavage planes."

The climate is tropical semiarid.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 40 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 78 to 80 degrees F."

Annaberg, Callabo, and Descalabrado soils are on higher positions, are shallow to volcanic bedrock, and not have vertic properties.  In addition, Annaberg soils are loamy-skeletal.  Coamo soils are on slightly lower positions, are very deep, and have argillic horizon. Fraternidad and Llanos soils are on lower adjacent positions, are very deep, and have smectitic mineralogy.  Juana Diaz soils are on higher positions, have less clay in the subsoils, and are shallow to sandstone. Pozo Blanco soils are on lower adjacent positions, have calcic horizons, have less clay in the subsoil and are Mollisols.  San German soils are on adjacent higher limestone hills, are shallow to limestone, and are clayey-skeletal."
