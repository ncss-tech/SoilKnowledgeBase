Foxcan soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 12 to 14 degrees C. and have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Grina soils have paralithic contacts at depths of 36 to 50 cm. Holborn soils have a horizon with identifiable secondary carbonates and do not have pararock fragments in the series control section. Hundraw soils have 8 to 18 percent clay in the soil profile and have a horizon with identifiable secondary carbonates. Puett, Stu, and Whilphang soils have paralithic contacts at depths of 25 to 50 cm. Tert soils average 18 to 27 percent clay and have 0 to 15 percent gravel in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jacratz soils are on mountains. They typically occur on backslopes with south or west aspects. Jacratz soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sedimentary rocks. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 1,483 to 2,195 meters. The climate is cool-semiarid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
