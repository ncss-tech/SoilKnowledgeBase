  "OVERVIEW": "The Jubilee series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with influence from granitic rocks.  Jubilee soils are on swales, flood plains, and sloughs on the toes of alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
