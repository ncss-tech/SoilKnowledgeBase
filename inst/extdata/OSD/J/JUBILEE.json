  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jubilee soils are on swales, flood plains, and sloughs on the toes of alluvial fans.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources but with a significant influence from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 1,433 to 1,710 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between the soil surface and 50 cm (very shallow to moderately deep free water occurrence classes) from December through June.  Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent.  These soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for brief periods between December and May or rare flooding for very brief periods year-round."
