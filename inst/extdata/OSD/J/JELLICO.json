The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from early March to early December.  The moisture control section (10 inches to the lithic contact) is dry in all parts from early July to early November (about 110 to 130 days).\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 4/3; 7.5YR 4/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3 or 7.5YR 3/2.  Rock fragments range from 30 to 40 percent cobbles or stones and 5 to 10 percent gravel.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral. Base saturation ranges from 50 to 75 percent.\nThe Bt horizon color is 10YR 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 6/4 or 7.5YR 4/4, 6/4. Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 3/4; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/2, 4/4, 4/6 or 5YR 3/2, 4/4.

The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Reference samples (A2, Bt3) were sent to Lincoln Lab.  Pedon number is S83CA-89-2 and sample numbers are 837729, 837730, unpublished.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.
