It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of lOYR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8 with few to common mottles in varying shades of brown, gray, or red.  Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Btv horizon is mottled in varying shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray, or it has a gray matrix with mottles in varying shades of brown, yellow, or red.  Texture is sandy clay loam.  Content of plinthite ranges from 5 to 15 by volume.\nBC or CB horizons, where present, have colors similar to the Btv horizon.  These horizons are sandy clay loam with lense and pockets of finer or coarser material."
