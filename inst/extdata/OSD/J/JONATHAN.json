  "OVERVIEW": "The Jonathan series consists of very deep, moderately well to somewhat excessively drained, very slowly or slowly permeable soils on slightly elevated knolls and ridges in flatwoods areas of the Lower Coastal Plains of Florida.  They formed in thick beds of sandy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 57 inches.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the Bh horizon is more than 50 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the A and E horizon and from extremely acid to very strongly acid in the Bh horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 6.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 8.  Vertical streaks of organic matter accumulation in old root channels range from none to common.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nIn some pedons, a transitional EB horizon 0.5 to 4.0 inches thick and containing many uncoated sand grains is between the base of the E horizon and the top of the Bh horizon.  It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is fine sand, sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is weakly to strongly cemented in 60 to 90 percent of the horizon.  Pockets of E horizon material in shades of gray range from none to common.  Some pedons have a lower Bh that is noncemented and have the same range of colors and textures.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon within 80 inches.  Where present, it has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nSome pedons have a C/Bh horizon with the same matrix colors as the BC horizon and with darker colored, weakly cemented Bh fragments.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Pockets of loamy fine sand range from none to common.  Texture is fine sand or sand."

The very poorly or poorly drained Ankona and Immokalee soils are on lower positions and are 30 to 50 inches in depth to the spodic horizon.  In addition, Ankona soils have an argillic horizon, while Immokalee soils do not have ortstein.  The somewhat excessively drained Hobe soils are on higher positions, have an argillic horizon, and do not have ortstein.  The somewhat poorly or moderately well drained Pomello soils are on lower positions and do not have ortstein.  The poorly drained Salerno soils are on lower positions.   The excessively drained St. Lucie soils are on higher positions, do not have spodic horizons, and are sandy throughout.   The somewhat poorly drained Satellite soils are on lower positions, do not have spodic horizons, and are sandy throughout."

It is below 60 inches most of the rest of each year."
