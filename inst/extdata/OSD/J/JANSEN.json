  "OVERVIEW": "The Jansen series consists of very deep, well drained moderately permeable soils formed in loamy sediments over alluvial sand and gravel.  These upland soils have slopes ranging from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches.",
