    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jansen soils are nearly level to sloping uplands.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 30 percent and range from short and irregular to medium length and smooth.  The soils formed in loamy alluvium or loess over alluvial sand and gravel.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from about 18 to 25 inches, and mean annual air temperatures range from 45 to 54 degrees F."

Anselmo soils have more sand in the control section and occur below Jansen soils.  Brocksburg soils have mollic epipedons greater than 20 inches thick and occur on similar landscapes.  Meadin soils contain more than 35 percent gravel in the control section, and are less than 20 inches to gravel.  They occur on steeper slopes.  O'Neill soils have more sand in the control section and occur on similar landscapes.  Reliance soils have more clay in the control section, lack sand and gravel, and occur on nearly level slopes below Jansen soils."
