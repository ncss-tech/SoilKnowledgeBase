Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the A horizon, and neutral to slightly alkaline in the Bw and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is loam or  clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Content of pebbles ranges from 0 to 30 percent, by volume.  Some pedons have a thin AB horizon with the same range of characteristics as the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.  Content of pebbles ranges from 0 to 30 percent, by volume.\nThe C horizon have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam  in the fine-earth fraction.  Content of pebbles ranges from 0 to 30 percent, by volume.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered basic igneous bedrock."

Annaberg, Cramer, Southgate, and Victory soils are on similar positions as Jealously soils.  In addition, Annaberg and Southgate soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections and are shallow to bedrock.  Cramer soils have mixed mineralogy and are shallow to bedrock.  Victory soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections and do not have a Mollic epipedon.  Parasol soils are on lower positions and are very deep."
