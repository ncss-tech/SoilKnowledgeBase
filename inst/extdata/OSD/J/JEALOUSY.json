  "STATES": "VI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Jealousy series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on summits and side slopes of volcanic hills and mountains.  They formed in residuum from plutonic bedrock.  Near the type location, the mean annual air temperature is about 80 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation rated is about 40 inches.  Slopes range from 12 to 70 percent.",

Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the A horizon, and neutral to slightly alkaline in the Bw and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is loam or  clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Content of pebbles ranges from 0 to 30 percent, by volume.  Some pedons have a thin AB horizon with the same range of characteristics as the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.  Content of pebbles ranges from 0 to 30 percent, by volume.\nThe C horizon have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam  in the fine-earth fraction.  Content of pebbles ranges from 0 to 30 percent, by volume.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered basic igneous bedrock."

Annaberg, Cramer, Southgate, and Victory soils are on similar positions as Jealously soils.  In addition, Annaberg and Southgate soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections and are shallow to bedrock.  Cramer soils have mixed mineralogy and are shallow to bedrock.  Victory soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections and do not have a Mollic epipedon.  Parasol soils are on lower positions and are very deep."
