  "OVERVIEW": "The Jensen series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are formed in silty alluvium and lacustrine sediments influenced by alluvium.  They are on lake terraces, fan terraces, and in drainageways.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
