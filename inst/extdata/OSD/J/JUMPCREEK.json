Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum from rhyolite.  The climate is cool and moist in winter and hot and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 280 to 330 mm, and average annual temperature ranges from 8 to 9 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 95 to 115 days."
