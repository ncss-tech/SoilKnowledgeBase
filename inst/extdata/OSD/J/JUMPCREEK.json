  "OVERVIEW": "The Jumpcreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in slope alluvium and residuum from rhyolite.  Jumpcreek soils are on structural benches.  Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  Average annual precipitation is 300 mm and average annual temperature is 9 degrees C.",
