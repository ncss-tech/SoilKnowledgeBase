  "OVERVIEW": "The Jayel series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from serpentinized peridotite. Jayel soils are on mountain and broad ridges and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 2670 millimeters (105 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
