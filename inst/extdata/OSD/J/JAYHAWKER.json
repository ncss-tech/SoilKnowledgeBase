  "OVERVIEW": "The Jayhawker series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils.  These nearly level to slightly depressional soils formed in loamy fluviomarine dpoesits of the Lissie Formation of early to mid-Pleistocene age. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1295 mm (51 in",
