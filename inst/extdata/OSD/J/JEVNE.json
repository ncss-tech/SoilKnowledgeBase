  "OVERVIEW": "The Jevne series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in stratified glacial till on glacial lake plains.  These soils have moderate permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
