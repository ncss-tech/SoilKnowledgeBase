  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are lithochromatic.  Mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  The Joseph soils are saturated at certain seasons of the year but are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days in all parts between 4 and 12 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 0 to 5 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and is 60 to 90 percent basalt fragments.  Very thin (less than 1/2 inch) random stratification with materials as fine as sandy loam occur.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.  It is extremely cobbly coarse sand, extremely cobbly sand, extremely cobbly loamy sand, extremely gravelly coarse sand, extremely cobbly loamy coarse sand, or extremely gravelly sand.  Organic matter is less than 1 percent.  The dark colors are inherited from basalt."
