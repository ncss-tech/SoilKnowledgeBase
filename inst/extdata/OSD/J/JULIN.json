  "OVERVIEW": "The Julin series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or residuum derived from semiconsolidated acid shales.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
