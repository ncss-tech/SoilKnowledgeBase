  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Jacanyon series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium over residuum from sedimentary rocks.  These soils are on backslopes and shoulders of foothills, hills and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 10 to 50 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
