    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cabinspring, Cagas, Derallo, Glassbutte, Roughridge, and Slockey series.\nCabinspring soils are dominated by gravel and average 35 to 45 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Cagas soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts. Derallo soils are deep to paralithic contacts. Glassbutte soils are very deep. Rough ridge soils are 150 to 200 cm to a paralithic contact of andesite.  Slockey soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September due to convection storms."
