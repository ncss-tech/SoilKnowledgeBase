  "OVERVIEW": "The Jimlake series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till derived mainly from limestone. These soils have a large component of volcanic ash in the surface layer. Jimlake soils are on moraines in glaciated valleys and on mountain slopes. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
