  "OVERVIEW": "The Jefferson series consists of deep and very deep, well-drained soils on mountain sides and foot slopes.  They formed in colluvium from soils formed in residuum of acid sandstone, shale, and siltstone.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  The average annual precipitation is about 49 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 57 degrees F.  Slopes range from 2 to 75 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum is more than 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 50 to more than 80 inches.  Content of rock fragments of sandstone range from 5 to 35 percent to a depth of about 40 inches, and below 40 inches from 20 to 80 percent.  Some areas are stony to extremely stony.  The soil ranges from strongly to very strongly acid, excep the A horizons which range from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam, or gravelly or cobbly analogs.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is similar to the A horizon.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  They are silt loam, loam, or sandy loam, or the gravelly or cobbly analogues.\nSome pedons have BA horizons similar to the BE horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown, yellow, red, and the lower part shades of gray.  It is loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam, or the gravelly or cobbly analogues.\nThe BC horizon is in shades of brown, red, or gray, and are usually mottled.  It is very gravelly, very channery, extremely gravelly, or extremely channery analogs of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has color and texture ranges like the BC horizon.  Some pedons have a 2C horizon, below a depth of about 50 inches, that are from shaly material with a higher content of clay."
