  "OVERVIEW": "The Junipero series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from igneous rocks.  Junipero soils are on uplands and have slopes of 30 to 85 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 5O degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact of weathered rock is 28 to 40 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature is 54 to 58 degrees F.  The soil between depths of 5 and 15 inches becomes moist in some part in November and remains moist until late May or June.  Base saturation is more than 50 percent in all parts, but is less than 75 percent in some part to a depth of 30 inches.  Rock fragments, mostly angular pebbles, make up 5 to 35 percent of the soil.  Organic matter content is 3 to 8 percent and decreases regularly to less than 1 percent between the depths of 23 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon is very dark gray, dark gray, very dark grayish brown, dark grayish brown, grayish brown, dark brown or brown (10YR 4/2, 5/2, 4/3, 5/3) and in the lower part of some pedons is dark brown or brown (7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 5/2, 5/4).  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam and is gravelly, cobbly or stony in some pedons.  This horizon is moderately acid to neutral and usually becomes more acid with increasing depth.\nThe Cr horizon is slightly acid to strongly acid and is easily crushed to gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loam.  It grades to unweathered rock at depths of 3 to 8 feet."

The bedrock consists mainly of granodiorite, gneiss, schist, and some sandstone.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters with some snow.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 80 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 55 degrees F., average January temperature is 37 to 42 degrees F., and average July temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F.  Freeze-free season averages 120 to 170 days."
