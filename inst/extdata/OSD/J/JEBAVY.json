Elevation is 183 to 244 meters (600 to 800 feet) above mean sea level."

Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the ortstein and high or very high in the rest of the profile. Permeability is moderate in the ortstein and rapid in the rest of the profile."

The series was proposed in Mason County, Michigan in 1991.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
