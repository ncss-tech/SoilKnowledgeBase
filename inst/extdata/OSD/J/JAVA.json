  "OVERVIEW": "The Java series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial till on uplands.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow in the underlying material.  Slopes range from 1 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free carbonates is less than 10 inches.  Java soils typically have carbonates to the surface when cultivated.  The soil is neutral or slighty  alkaline through the Bw horizon and slightly or moderately alkaline below.  It can contain up to 15 percent by volume of pebbles and/or cobbles.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or clay loam but is gravelly or stony loam in some pedons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or clay loam.  A part or all of the Bw horizon is incorporated in the Ap horizon where cultivated. Some pedons have an AC horizon up to 10 inches thick and it has color and texture similar to the Bk horizon.\nThe Bk horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam or loam.  Few or common, fine to coarse, accumulations of carbonate are in the Bk horizons.\nThe C horizon has color and texture like the Bk horizon.  Mottles or iron stains inherent to the parent material are in most pedons.  Few or common nests of gypsum and other salts are in the C horizon in some pedons."

The mean annual temperature ranges from about 45 to 48 degrees F; mean annual precipitation from 17 to 21 inches.
