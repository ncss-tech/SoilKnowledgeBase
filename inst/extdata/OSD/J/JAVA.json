  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free carbonates is less than 10 inches.  Java soils typically have carbonates to the surface when cultivated.  The soil is neutral or slighty  alkaline through the Bw horizon and slightly or moderately alkaline below.  It can contain up to 15 percent by volume of pebbles and/or cobbles.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or clay loam but is gravelly or stony loam in some pedons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or clay loam.  A part or all of the Bw horizon is incorporated in the Ap horizon where cultivated. Some pedons have an AC horizon up to 10 inches thick and it has color and texture similar to the Bk horizon.\nThe Bk horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam or loam.  Few or common, fine to coarse, accumulations of carbonate are in the Bk horizons.\nThe C horizon has color and texture like the Bk horizon.  Mottles or iron stains inherent to the parent material are in most pedons.  Few or common nests of gypsum and other salts are in the C horizon in some pedons."

Slope gradients range from 1 to 40 percent.  These soils formed in friable, loam or clay loam glacial till.  The mean annual temperature ranges from about 45 to 48 degrees F; mean annual precipitation from 17 to 21 inches.  Growing season is about 130 to 155 days; average growing season precipitation from 13 to 18 inches; and growing degree days are about 2800 to 3400."

Eakin and Highmore soils have an argillic horizon and are typically on smooth side slopes below the Java soils. Glenham soils have an argillic horizon and are on smooth side slopes and toe slopes below the Java soils."
