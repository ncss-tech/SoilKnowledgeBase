  "OVERVIEW": "The Jamash series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from Permian shale. Jamash soils are on pediments in River Valleys in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 74 centimeters (29 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C. (59 degrees F.).",
