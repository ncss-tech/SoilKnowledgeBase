Rock fragments, mostly cobbles on the surface, range from 35 to 75 percent.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, or 5/4.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, or 7.5YR 3/2.  Clay content ranges from 10 to 12 percent.  Rock fragments, mostly cobbles or gravel, range from 10 to 80 percent. Organic matter ranges from 2 to 5 percent.  Base saturation by ammonium acetate ranges from 25 to 36 percent.  NaF pH ranges from 10.5 to 11.5. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon color is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4 or 7.5YR 4/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3 or 7.5YR 3/2.
