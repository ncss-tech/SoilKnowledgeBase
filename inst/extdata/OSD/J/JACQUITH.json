Slope gradients are from 0 to 12\npercent but dominantly between 2 and 5 percent.  Elevations range from\n2,200 to 3,500 feet.  The soils formed in eolian or alluvial deposits\nof mixed mineralogy.  The climate is semiarid and has dry summers and\nmoist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 7.5 to 11 inches,\nincluding 8 to 30 inches of snow.  Average annual air temperature is 45\nto 52 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 120 to 160 days."
