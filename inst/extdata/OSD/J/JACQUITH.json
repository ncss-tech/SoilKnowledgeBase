  "OVERVIEW": "The Jacquith series consists of moderately deep to a duripan soils on\nfan terraces.  They formed in mixed alluvium and eolian deposits.\nPermeability is rapid.  Slopes are 0 to 12 percent.  The average annual\nprecipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual air temperature\nis about 49 degrees F.",
