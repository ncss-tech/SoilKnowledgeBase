  "OVERVIEW": "The Jorn series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on concave side slopes of mountains.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rock with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  Slopes are 2 to 55 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to sedimentary bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick and includes the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Hue is 7.5YR or 10YR.  The particle-size control section has 30 to 50 percent field estimated clay with a weighted average of 35 to 45 percent.  The upper 7 to 14 inches is estimated to have 10 to 30 percent volcanic glass and 0.4 to 1.0 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 5 to 10 percent gravel and 10 to 20 percent cobbles.\nThe Bt1 horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is ashy silty clay loam or ashy clay loam with 30 to 40 percent clay.  It contains 5 to 15 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe 2Bt2 horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silty clay or clay with 40 to 50 percent clay.  It contains 15 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe 2Bt3 horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay or clay with 40 to 50 percent clay.  It contains 15 to 30 percent gravel and 30 to 50 percent soft gravel size fragments."

Fawnspring soils are deep to bedrock and are on north-facing side slopes of mountains.  Littlefawn soils have an ochric epipedon and are on north-facing side slopes of mountains.  Logsprings soils are fine-loamy over clayey, moderately well drained, very deep to bedrock and are on concave areas of adjacent benches.  Yawkola soils are clayey-skeletal, deep to bedrock, and are on south-facing side slopes of mountains."
