The soils formed in thick sandy deposits of Willis geology that has been somewhat reworked by wind.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 68 to 70 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 40 inches.  Frost free days range from 260 to 280 and the elevation ranges from 200 to 400 feet.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 52 to 60."
