  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on summits, shoulders and backslopes of dissected till plains considered to be formed during the Illinoian stage. Slope ranges from 2 to 12 percent. They formed in 76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 inches) of loess and in the underlying paleosol in till and residuum from black shale. The lower part of the loess called \"gritty loess\" contains a significantly higher sand content. The shale is from the New Albany formation, Devonian System. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F. Frost-free period is 170 to 200 days. Elevation is 152 to 213 meters (500 to 700 feet) above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Avonburg, Cincinnati, Deputy, Nabb, and Trappist soils. The somewhat poorly drained Avonburg soils are on summits of till plains. The moderately well drained Cincinnati and Nabb soils do not have a lithic contact within 203 cm (80 inches), and are on similar landform positions as the Jennings soils. The moderately well drained, deep Deputy soils and the well drained, moderately deep Trappist soils are on hills and on strath terraces."

In non-eroded to moderately eroded soils, the depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 61 to 91 cm (2.0 to 3.0 feet) in normal years. In severely eroded soils, the depth to the top of the perched seasonal high water table ranges from 46 to 61 cm (1.5 to 2.0 feet) in normal years. The potential for surface water runoff ranges from medium to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high above the fragipan and low to moderately high within the fragipan. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and slow or very slow within the fragipan."
