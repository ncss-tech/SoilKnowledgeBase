  "OVERVIEW": "The Judith series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium or colluvium derived mainly from limestone.

The OSD typical pedon listed 65 percent gravel while the original description from Fergus County reflected 50 percent gravel.  The Judith series should be investigated in the future to determine whether it is typically fine-loamy or loamy-skeletal.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
