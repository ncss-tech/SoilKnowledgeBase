  "OVERVIEW": "The Jaybee series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Jaybee soils are on hills, mountains, and plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
