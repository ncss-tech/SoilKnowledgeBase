  "OVERVIEW": "The Jahant series consists of deep to hardpan, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed but predominantly granitic rock sources.  Jahant soils are on old terraces.  Slope is 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

Unless irrigated, the soil between depths of 5 and 15 inches is moist in all parts from December to late April and is dry in all parts from June 1 thru October 15.  The mean annual soil temperature is 62 degrees to 63 degrees F.  Layers with more than 35 percent clay occur below the particle size control section.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 6/3, 5/3, 5/2; 7.5YR 5/2 or 4/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3; or 7.5YR 3/2.  It is sandy loam or loam with 10 to 25 percent clay.  Organic matter is 1 to 3 percent in the upper part and decreases to less than 1 percent in the lower part.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon is 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 6/4; 10YR 6/3 or 6/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/4; 10YR 3/3, 4/3 or 4/4.

It has an abrupt upper boundary with an absolute clay increase of 15 to 30 percent more than the overlying horizon.  It is clay loam or clay with 35 to 60 percent clay.\nThe Bq or Bqm horizon is strongly cemented to indurated.  It has similar colors as the B horizon.  Primary cementing agents are silica and iron."
