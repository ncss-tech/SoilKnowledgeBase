    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Combined thickness of the A and Bt horizons and depth to the duripan is 40 to 60 inches.  Unless irrigated, the soil between depths of 5 and 15 inches is moist in all parts from December to late April and is dry in all parts from June 1 thru October 15.  The mean annual soil temperature is 62 degrees to 63 degrees F.  Layers with more than 35 percent clay occur below the particle size control section.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 6/3, 5/3, 5/2; 7.5YR 5/2 or 4/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3; or 7.5YR 3/2.  It is sandy loam or loam with 10 to 25 percent clay.  Organic matter is 1 to 3 percent in the upper part and decreases to less than 1 percent in the lower part.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon is 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 6/4; 10YR 6/3 or 6/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/4; 10YR 3/3, 4/3 or 4/4.  It is loam or clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay.  The lower part of Bt is 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4; 10YR 5/2, 5/4, 5/6 or 6/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6; 10YR 4/4 or 4/6.  It has an abrupt upper boundary with an absolute clay increase of 15 to 30 percent more than the overlying horizon.  It is clay loam or clay with 35 to 60 percent clay.\nThe Bq or Bqm horizon is strongly cemented to indurated.  It has similar colors as the B horizon.  Primary cementing agents are silica and iron."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Jahant soils are on old alluvial terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium from mixed but mainly granitic rock sources.  Elevations range from 20 to 160 feet.  The climate is subhumid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Dense ground fog often occurs in the winter months.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches.  Mean January temperature is 45 degrees degrees F.; mean July temperature is 77 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 260 to 280 days."

Bruella soils average less than 35 percent clay and are on stream terraces often dissecting areas of Jahant soils.  Corning soils have moist values in the A horizon of more than 4 and are on relatively older, higher terraces.  San Joaquin soils have a duripan at 20 to 40 inches and are in similar landscape positions."
