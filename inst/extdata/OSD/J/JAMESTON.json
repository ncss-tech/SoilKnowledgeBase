  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  The solum typically is neutral or slightly acid in the upper part and neutral or mildly alkaline in the lower part.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1.  It typically is silty clay loam but ranges to silt loam or loam.  Sand content ranges from about 15 to 25 percent, and clay content ranges from 26 to 35 percent.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 3; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles typically are few or common.\nThe 2Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 1 through 4.  A thin pebble band is at the top of the 2Bg horizon in most pedons. Tongues of sandy loam or loamy sand extend downward from the pebble band to depths of 3 to 5 feet in some pedons.\nThe 2Btg horizon typically is mottled and has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 8.  It averages between 30 and 35 percent clay and 30 to 45 percent sand.  The part of the 2Bt horizon with distinct grayish coatings of 1 chroma on the faces of prisms ranges from 10 to 30 inches in thickness.\nA BCg horizon is in some pedons.\nThe 2Cg horizon typically is mottled and has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8.  It is clay loam with 28 to 35 percent clay."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Barry, Berville, Brookston, Buntingville, Clackamas, Cordova, Hamel, Marengo, Millgrove, Navan, Rensselaer, and Westland series in the same family and Clyde and Tripoli series.  All these soils except Navan lack the very firm consistence and distinct grayish coating on the faces of prisms in the 2Btg horizon.  Navan soils have a thinner solum and contain less sand and coarse fragments in the 2Btg and 2Cg horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jameston soils are on slight concave areas at the upper end of upland drainageways onthe Iowan Erosion Surface.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Jameston soils formed in about 18 to 30 inches of loamy sediments containing 15 to 25 percent fine to coarse sand and the underlying very firm glacial till.  In most pedons, a thin pebble band is at the boundary between the two materials.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 45 to 49 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 30 to 34 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Clyde soils and the Cresco, Kenyon, Protivin, and Riceville soils.  Clyde soils formed in stratified materials overlying glacial till and are in drainageways below Jameston soils.  Cresco, Kenyon, Protivin, and Riceville soils have browner B horizons and are on ridges and side slopes above Jameston soils.  Jameston soils form a drainage sequence with moderately well drained Cresco (Typic Argiudolls) and somewhat poorly drained Protivin sils (Aquic Argiudolls)."
