  "OVERVIEW": "The Juliette series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or loess influenced colluvium derived from limestone. These soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 30 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 600 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.",
