  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to limestone in about 60 to 65 percent of the pedon is 26 to 40 inches and in about 30 to 35 percent depth is 40 to 59 inches.  Within the pedon, in solution holes, the solum extends to depths below 60 inches.  Limestone or chert boulders are on the surface and within the solum of many areas, comprising up to 3 percent of the surface area.\nThe A horizon has hue 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid. Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon predominantly has hue 10YR, value of 5 to 8 and  chroma of 6 or less; or hue 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6 but ranges to hue 7.5YR, value 5 to 7, chroma 4 to 8 in some pedons.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.  Texture is sand or fine sand.  Where present, light gray streaks of uncoated sand grains are due to sand stripping and are not indicative of wetness.\nThe Bt horizon has hue 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8, without mottles with chroma of 3 or more.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  In some pedons, the lower 3 to 6 inches of the Bt horizon contains about 3 to 10 percent of limestone fragments 2 to 10 inches in size.  In solution holes, which comprise about 1 to 20 percent, the texture of the Bt horizon is usually sandy clay loam in the upper part and sandy clay loam or sandy clay in the lower part.  Fine to medium nodules of soft limestone are usually in the Bt horizon in the solution holes, but normally make up less than 20 percent by volume.\nSome pedons have a 2Cr horizon of soft limestone above the harder limestone.  Where present, hue is 10YR, value 7 or 8, chroma 1 or 2.  Hard limestone fragments and boulders occur randomly throughout the horizon and range from few to many.\nThe 2R  horizon is white limestone soft enough to be dug with light power equipment.  Solution holes about 4 to 12 inches in diameter and filled with sandy loam or sandy clay loam occur in the 2Cr or 2R horizon.  Depth to the underlying limestone is highly variable within short distances."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Hague series in the same family and the Chiefland series in a closely similar family.  Hague soils lack limestone within depths of 80 inches.  Chiefland soils are in a thermic family."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jonesville soils occur on nearly level to gently sloping ridges and gently undulating uplands of the hyperthermic region of Florida.  A few small limestone rock outcrops and lime sinks occur in the landscape.  The soil formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments overlying limestone.  The mean annual precipitation is about 50 to 60 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 70 to 74 degrees F.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent."

All the associated soils except Pedro soils lack limestone within depths of 80 inches.  Pedro soils have limestone within depths of 20 inches.  Apopka and Arredondo soils have A and E horizons 40 to 80 inches thick.  Candler, Paola, and Tavares soils are sandy to depths of 80 inches or more.  Kendrick soils have low base saturation.  In addition, Candler soils have lamellae and Tavares soils are moderately well drained."

Natural vegetation consists of slash and longleaf pines; post, bluejack, laurel and live oaks; scattered red oak and hickory.  The understory is chalky and other bluestems, panicum, huckleberry, blackberry, pineland threeawn and scattered sawpalmetto."
