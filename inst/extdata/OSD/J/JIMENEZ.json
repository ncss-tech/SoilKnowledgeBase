Similar soils are Amistad (TX), Boracho (TX), Ector (TX), Kimbrough (NM), Langtry (TX), Olmos (TX), Quemado (TX), Real (TX), Valco (TX), Zapata (TX), and Zorra (TX) series.\nAmistad, Boracho, Ector, Kimbrough, and Real soils: have mean annual soil temperatures less than 72 degrees F. In addition, Amistad, Ector, Langtry, and Real soils, as well as, Olmos and Zorra soils have carbonatic mineralogy.\nQuemado soils: have an ochric epipedon and argillic horizon.\nValco soils: contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments.\nZapata soils: are in a loamy family and have an ochric epipedon."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Used as native range for sheep, goats, cattle, and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation consists of mid grasses, a few short grasses, about 25 percent woody shrubs and 5 percent perennial forbs. With retrogression, woody plants, dominated by guajillo and blackbrush, form a dense canopy.  Other increasers and invaders are threeawn, hairy tridens, and red grama. The ecological site is Gravelly Ridge 18-35 PZ (R083BY419TX)."
