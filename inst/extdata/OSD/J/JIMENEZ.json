  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",

Native vegetation consists of mid grasses, a few short grasses, about 25 percent woody shrubs and 5 percent perennial forbs. With retrogression, woody plants, dominated by guajillo and blackbrush, form a dense canopy.  Other increasers and invaders are threeawn, hairy tridens, and red grama. The ecological site is Gravelly Ridge 18-35 PZ (R083BY419TX)."
