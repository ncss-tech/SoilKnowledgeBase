  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Jimenez series consists of very shallow to shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in gravelly loamy alluvium.  The soils are on gently sloping knobs of paleoterraces.Slope ranges from 1 to about 30 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F.) and mean annual precipitation is about 533 mm (21 in).",

Native vegetation consists of mid grasses, a few short grasses, about 25 percent woody shrubs and 5 percent perennial forbs. With retrogression, woody plants, dominated by guajillo and blackbrush, form a dense canopy.  Other increasers and invaders are threeawn, hairy tridens, and red grama. The ecological site is Gravelly Ridge 18-35 PZ (R083BY419TX)."
