  "OVERVIEW": "The Julius series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium or residuum derived from semiconsolidated tuff.  These soils are on alluvial fans stream terraces and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
