  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Jackland series are very deep, moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained with very slow permeability.  They formed in residuum that weathered from diabase, basalt and gabbro of the Northern part of the Piedmont plateau.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

Partially weathered diabase or basalt gravel range from to 0 to 30 percent throughout.  Few boulders are in some pedons. Reaction is very strongly acid through moderately acid in the A and upper B horizons and from very strongly acid through mildly alkaline in the lower B and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 6.  The Ap or A horizons are silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5 Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silt loam, loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Some pedons have hue of 2.5Y in the lower B horizon.  The Bt horizon is clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Some pedons have hue of 2.5Y in the lower B horizon.  The BC horizon is clay loam, sandy clay loam, sandy clay, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon is commonly multicolored in shades of brown, yellow, white, green and black, or has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 8.  Texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or less commonly loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 44 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F."

Argillic horizon - zone from 15 to 40 inches (Bt and BCt horizons).\n3.
