  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 48 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Partially weathered diabase or basalt gravel range from to 0 to 30 percent throughout.  Few boulders are in some pedons. Reaction is very strongly acid through moderately acid in the A and upper B horizons and from very strongly acid through mildly alkaline in the lower B and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 6.  The Ap or A horizons are silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5 Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silt loam, loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Some pedons have hue of 2.5Y in the lower B horizon.  The Bt horizon is clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Some pedons have hue of 2.5Y in the lower B horizon.  The BC horizon is clay loam, sandy clay loam, sandy clay, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon is commonly multicolored in shades of brown, yellow, white, green and black, or has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 8.  Texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or less commonly loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jackland soils are on the Northern part of the Piedmont Plateau uplands commonly associated with the Triassic Region.  These soils are on broad convex ridges and slope gradients range from 0 to 15 percent.  They have developed in residuum that weathered from diabase, basalt and gabbro.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 44 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F."

    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil has previously been mapped as Iredell series which is thermic and typic.\nThe 5/2003 revision adds gabbro to the parent materials to facilitate correlation activities in the MO14 region. Minor revisions were also made to other sections.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - zone from 0 to 15 inches (Ap and BEt horizons).\n2. Argillic horizon - zone from 15 to 40 inches (Bt and BCt horizons).\n3. Aquic conditions - perched seasonal saturation from a depth of 10 to 30 inches (BEt and Bt1 horizons).\nSIR=VA0184\nMLRA=148\nREVISED=9/97-RRD ; 5/2003-JAK,DHK\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
