Denbar soils are dry for 120 days or more during summer and fall and have a duripan at 40 to 60 inches.  Deshler soils are moderately deep.  Deter soils are mildly to moderately alkaline in the lower part of the B horizon and have 6 to 10 inches thick A horizons.  Deterson soils are dry for more than 80 days in summer and fall and have a solum thicker than 45 inches.  Medford soils have average annual temperature of 50 to 55 degrees F. and a frost-free season of l50 to l70 days.  Mindego soils have a C:N ratio of organic matter in the A horizon wider than l3.5, have a small (9 to 11 degrees F.) summer-winter temperature change, frost-free season of about 300 days and bedrock within a depth of 60 inches.  Nebeker soils are slightly or moderately calcareous, have sola more than 50 inches thick, and have chroma of 2 or 3 in the mollic epipedon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jacknife soils are in very gently sloping to steep alluvial and colluvial fans at elevations of 1,200 to 4,500 feet.  Slopes range from about 1 to 45 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from basalt and related basic igneous rocks.  The climate is subhumid continental.  The average frost-free period is 110 to 150 days; and the average annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches, including 4 to 10 feet of snowfall.  Average annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F."
