  "OVERVIEW": "The Jerval series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, loess, and volcanic ash.  Jerval soils are on fan remnants and lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
