  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Jonesbay series consists of very deep, subaqueous (permanently submersed), moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity soils that formed in loamy estuarine deposits. These nearly level soils occur on lagoon bottoms and estuarine tidal streams of estuaries. Slope is less than 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1295 mm (51 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (69 degrees F).",
