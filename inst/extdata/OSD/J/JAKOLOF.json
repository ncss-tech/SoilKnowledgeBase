  "OVERVIEW": "The Jakolof series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in a silty mantle of volcanic ash over alluvial deposits.  Jakolof soils are on stream terraces and alluvium fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 70 inches.",
