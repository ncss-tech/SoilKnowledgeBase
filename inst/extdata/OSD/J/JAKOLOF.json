Soils in the same great group include the Kasitsna(T) and Seldovia(T) series. Kasitsna soils have a particle size control section that is composed of medial over loamy skeletal material.  Seldovia soils have a particle size control section that is composed entirely of medial material."

Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 10 to 1000 feet.\nThe climate is maritime with mild winters and cool summers.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 65 to 75 inches and the mean annual snowfall is 70 to 120 inches.

Chenega soils do not have spodic horizons, are sandy-skeletal, and are on floodplains. Kasitsna soils are on glacial moraines and mountainslopes. Koyuktolik soils are formed in organic matter accumulated in depressions. Seldovia soils occur on mountainslopes.  Tutka soils have bedrock within 20 inches and are on glacially abraded ridges and mountainslopes."
