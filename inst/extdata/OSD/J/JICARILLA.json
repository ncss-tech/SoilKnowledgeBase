  "OVERVIEW": "The Jicarilla series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in fine-textured alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Jicarilla soils are on alluvial valley floors, stream terraces, and drainageways with slope gradients of 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
