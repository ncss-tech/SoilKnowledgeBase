    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Josie soils are strongly sloping to very steep on exposed mountain slopes and ridges at elevations of 6,000 to 8,500 feet. Slopes range from 8 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks mixed with volcanic ash. Average annual precipitation is 28 to 45 inches. Average annual temperature is 35 to 39 degrees F. Frost-free period is 15 to 60 days."
