  "OVERVIEW": "The Jasseek series consists of very deep, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in alluvium from lacustrine sediments over alluvium from igneous rocks. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent in valleys. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
