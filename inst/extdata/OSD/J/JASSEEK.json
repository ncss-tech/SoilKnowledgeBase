Correco soils have an average annual soil temperature of 48 to 50 degrees F. Northmore soils contain more than 45 percent sand in the particle-size control section and have Btq horizons with 15 percent durinodes. Schoer soils are less than 30 inches to the base of the argillic horizon and are slightly or moderately alkaline within the argillic horizon. Zymans are 40 to greater than 60 inches to a paralithic contact and have Bk horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jasseek soils are nearly level to moderately sloping on relict lake terraces at elevations of 2,600 to 2,800 feet. These soils formed in alluvium from lacustrine sediments over alluvium from igneous (dominantly granitic) rocks. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. The average annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 14 inches. The average annual temperature ranges from 50 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 140 to 150 days."
