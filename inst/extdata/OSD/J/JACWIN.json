  "BYREV": "Rev. RJK-LDC-TWN",
  "REVDATE": "03/2006",
  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Jacwin series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy glacial sediments and in the underlying residuum from calcareous shale. These soils are on treads and risers on structural benches. Slopes range from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 83 centimeters (33 inches).",
