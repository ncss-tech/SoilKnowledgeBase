  "OVERVIEW": "The Jedburg series consists of somewhat poorly drained and moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and silty marine or fluvial sediments.  These nearly level soils are on broad flats or slightly depressed areas on terraces on the Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",
