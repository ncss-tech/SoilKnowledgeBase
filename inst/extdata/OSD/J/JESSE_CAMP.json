    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jesse Camp soils are on inset fans, stream or lake terraces and flood plains.  These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine materials derived mainly from mostly volcanic rocks with a component of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations are 1,375 to 2,320 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 80 to 110 days."

Disabel soils have a fine texture natric horizon.  Kisring soils are somewhat poorly drained, have iron mottles at depths of 50 to 100 cm, have a fine loamy particle-size control section and a calcic horizon.  Lolak soils are poorly drained and have a fine particle-size control section."
