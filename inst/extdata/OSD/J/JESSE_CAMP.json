  "OVERVIEW": "The Jesse Camp series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine materials derived mainly from volcanic rocks with a component of volcanic ash. Jesse Camp soils are on inset fans, stream or lake terraces, and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
