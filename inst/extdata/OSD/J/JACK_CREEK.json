  "OVERVIEW": "The Jack Creek series consists of deep and very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from chert and shale.  The Jack Creek soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 50 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 375 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.",

The soils have formed in residuum and colluvium derived from chert and shale.
