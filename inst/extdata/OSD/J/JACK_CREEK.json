  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Jack Creek soils are on mountain slopes at elevations of 1,770 to 2,130.  The slopes commonly have south exposures but some have east exposures at the lower elevations.  Slopes are 50 to 75 percent.  The soils have formed in residuum and colluvium derived from chert and shale.  The average annual temperature is 5 to 8 degrees C.; mean annual precipitation is 360 to 400 mm; and the frost-free season is about 80 to 95 days."
