  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges in thickness from 7\nto 15 inches, thickness of solum ranges from 15 to 40 inches, depth to calcareous matrix material ranges from 8 to 24 inches, and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Calcium carbonate equivalent in the\nstrongest part of the zone of calcium carbonate accumulation is typically\nabout 4 or 5 percent but ranges from 1 to 10 percent.  Bulk calcium carbonate equivalent, including gravel fragments, ranges from 6 to 30 percent in the solum.  The soil is 80 to 100 percent base saturated with\nexchangeable sodium and potassium remaining constant or increasing slightly with depth.  Typically the solum extends to bedrock, but in some\npedons a C horizon may intervene.  Content of coarse fragments is typically 5 to 10 percent but ranges from 2 to 15 percent in the particle\nsize control section and is mostly fine limestone fragments in the upper\npart of the control section increasing in size in the lower part.  The average annual soil temperature is 38 degrees F., and the average summer\nsoil temperature is 53 degrees F. without an 0 horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3\nmoist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Typically, the horizon has strong crumb or granular structure but the structure is weak subangular blocky in some peds.  Dry consistence ranges from soft to slightly hard.  Reaction ranges from pH 6.5 to pH 7.6.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5\nmoist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  In some pedons, value of 4 dry and 3 moist occur above depths of 16 inches in the Bt horizon.  This horizon has weak prismatic and subangular blocky structure.  Dry consistence ranges from hard to very hard.  Texture is typically clay or silty clay with clay ranging from 35 to 50 percent, silt from 15 to 55 percent, and\nsand from 5 to 40 percent.  Reaction ranges from pH 6.8 to pH 7.8.  Hue of the BCk and Ck horizons if present is 2.5Y or 10YR.  Reaction ranges from pH 8.0 to pH 8.4."

The Brinkert, Buckskin, T Florissant, Gothic, Heath, Jerry, Sessions and Youman soils have no lithic contact above 40 inches.  Sneffels soils lack a zone of lime accumulation.  Little Horn soils have mean annual soil temperatures\ngreater than 40 degrees F.  Mayoworth, Owen Creek, Piltz and Trout Creek\nsoils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches."
