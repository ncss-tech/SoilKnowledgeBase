    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

Depth to an indurated carbonate cemented hardpan is 20 to 40 inches.  Electrical conductivity of the saturation extract is 0 to 2 mmhos/cm. Secondary carbonate is at a depth of 17-20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam, or loam with 15 to 55 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, gravelly sandy clay loam or gravelly clay loam.  The Bt horizon has a moderate coarse or moderate medium subangular blocky structure, or moderate medium prismatic structure.  Clay content ranges from 27 to 35 percent.  It has from 0 to 35 percent rock fragments which are predominantly gravel but include cobbles.  This horizon is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a Btk horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture of the fine earth fraction commonly is loam or sandy loam, but the range includes sandy clay loam, clay loam and loamy sand.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 55 percent and are gravel and cobbles.  Clay content is 10 to 18 percent. Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bkm horizon is moderately to very strongly indurated."

The soils formed in alluvium from basic and intermediate igneous and sedimentary rocks.  These soils occur at elevations of 5,200 to 6,300 feet.  The climate is semiarid, having a mean annual temperature of 45 to 50 degrees F., mean summer temperature of 66 to 71 degrees F., mean annual precipitation of 8 to l2 inches. The freeze-free period is l00 to l40 days."
