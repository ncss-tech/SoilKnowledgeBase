  "OVERVIEW": "The Jeneva series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess, a thin layer of pedisediment, and a paleosol formed in till. They are on till plains. Slope ranges from 2 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
