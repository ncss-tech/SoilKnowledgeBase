  "OVERVIEW": "The Jackalope series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountain backslopes.  Jackalope soils are formed in volcanic ash overlying colluvium from andesite.  Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
