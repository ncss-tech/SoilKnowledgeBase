  "OVERVIEW": "The Joeney series consists of poorly drained soils that are shallow to an ortstein pan and formed in medium textured eolian material overlying stratified marine deposits.  Joeney soils are on old marine terraces and have slopes of 0 to 7 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually saturated above the Bs horizon during the winter and spring. The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  Depth of rooting and downward water movement is restricted by the thin lenses of ortstein in the Bs horizon and by the very firm 2C horizon.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.\nAn A horizon, in some pedons, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, chroma of 2 or 3, and is up to 4 inches in thickness.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam, is very high in organic matter and has many roots.\nThe E horizon has value of 5 to 7 moist, 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It commonly is very fine sandy loam, but ranges to silt loam or loam.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam and high in organic matter and fibrous roots.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma mainly of 4 to 8 moist and dry with streaks of 1 to 4 occurring randomly throughout.  The ratio of free iron to carbon ranges from 1.0 to 4.0. It is massive or platy and is weakly or strongly cemented.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7 moist , 6 to 8 dry and chroma of 2 to 6 moist and dry.  It has few to many distinct or prominent redox concentrations and is mottled.  It is weathered from siltstone or marine sediments and is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam, usually thinly to thickly stratified.  Below a depth of 40 inches texture ranges to sandy loam and clay loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Joeney soils are on old marine terraces at elevations of 150 to 550 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 7 percent.  The soils formed in medium textured eolian materials overlying stratified marine deposits on wave eroded surfaces.  The soils are usually on flats or in slight depressions.  The marine climate is cool and wet in the winter and cool and moist during the summer with fog.  The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 90 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F., and mean July temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 190 to 300 days.  The Joeney soils occur on the Seven Devils geomorphic surface."
