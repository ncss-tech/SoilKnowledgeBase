  "OVERVIEW": "The Jury series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in weathered granitic or metamorphic colluvium and residuum with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  They are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and moderately rapid or rapid in the lower part.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.  The average precipitation is about 42 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
