  "REVDATE": "06/2002",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Juana Diaz series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in residuum weathered from sandstone.  They are on rounded hilltops and sideslopes of uplands.  Slopes ranges from 20 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F.",

Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is clay loam.  Consistence is slightly sticky and plastic.\nThe Bw horizons hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 or 6.  Texture is silt loam, clay loam or loam, and never exceed 35 percent in clay.   Structure ranges from weak medium to weak fine subangular blocky.  Consistence is sliightly sticky and plastic in the upper B horizons, and friable in the lower B horizons.\nThe BC horizon has similar color and texture as the Bw horizon.  Saprolite ranges from 10 to 40 percent.\nThe Cr horizon is semi-consolidated sandstone."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Callabo, Victory, and Vieques series in the same subgroup, and the Diamond, Pandura, Sabana, and Yunes series.  The Callabo soils are finer textured.  The Victory soils are thicker.  The Vieques soils are coarser textured, and have coarse fragments.  The Diamond soils have hard limestone within 20 inches and colors of soil are in redder hues.  Pandura soils have a thinner, coarser textured solum.  Sabana soils have hard volcanic rock within 20 inches and solum is more acid.  Yunes soils have coarse fragments throughout the solum and the soil is more acid."
