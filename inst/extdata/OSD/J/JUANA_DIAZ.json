Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is clay loam.  Consistence is slightly sticky and plastic.\nThe Bw horizons hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 or 6.  Texture is silt loam, clay loam or loam, and never exceed 35 percent in clay.   Structure ranges from weak medium to weak fine subangular blocky.  Consistence is sliightly sticky and plastic in the upper B horizons, and friable in the lower B horizons.\nThe BC horizon has similar color and texture as the Bw horizon.  Saprolite ranges from 10 to 40 percent.\nThe Cr horizon is semi-consolidated sandstone."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Callabo, Victory, and Vieques series in the same subgroup, and the Diamond, Pandura, Sabana, and Yunes series.  The Callabo soils are finer textured.  The Victory soils are thicker.  The Vieques soils are coarser textured, and have coarse fragments.  The Diamond soils have hard limestone within 20 inches and colors of soil are in redder hues.  Pandura soils have a thinner, coarser textured solum.  Sabana soils have hard volcanic rock within 20 inches and solum is more acid.  Yunes soils have coarse fragments throughout the solum and the soil is more acid."

The soil formed in loamy residuum weathered from sandstone.   The climate is semiarid.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 40 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 80 degrees F. The range in mean annual soil temperature is from 78 to 80 degrees F."
