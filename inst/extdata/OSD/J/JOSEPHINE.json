  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are dry during the summer for 60 to 90 consecutive days in Oregon and 90 to 110 in California in all parts of the moisture control section.  The soils also are moist during the winter.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 56 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Uncoated sand and silt coatings are common on faces of peds in the upper part of the B horizon in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It has 10 to 30 percent soft rock fragmants and 15 to 30 percent gravel.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It has 15 to 30 percent soft rock fragmants and 15 to 30 percent gravel.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR moist and 7.5YR or 5YR dry, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 8 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It averages 27 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 35 percent partially weathered and unweathered gravel.  It has weak or moderate structure and few to common, faint to distinct clay films.  It is slightly acid to very strongly acid with acidity decreasing with depth.\nThe BC horizon has similar ranges in color and texture but gravel content is 15 to 50 percent.  It is gravelly clay loam, gravelly silty clay loam, very gravelly clay loam or very gravelly silty clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Acker, Diamond Springs and Jocal series.  Acker soils have a Bt horizon with moist hue yellower than 7.5YR and are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days.  Diamond Springs soils are 24 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact, have a Bt horizon dominantly yellower than 7.5YR hue and are structureless.  Jocal soils are dry for 90 consecutive days or more during the summer."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Josephine soils are on broad ridgetops, toeslopes, footslopes, and side slopes of mountains.  Elevations are 200 to 4,000 feet in Oregon and up to 5,500 in California. Slope gradients dominantly are 35 to 60 percent but range from 2 to 75 percent.  The soils formed in moderately fine textured colluvium and residuum weathered from sedimentary, metamorphosed sedimentary, and volcanic rocks.  The climate consists of hot, dry summers and warm, moist to wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 30 to 60 inches but may range up to 70 inches in California and up to 100 inches in the interior mountains of Curry County, Oregon.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F in Oregon and as high as 58 degrees F in California.  The average January temperature is about 35 degrees F, and the average July temperature is about 65 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 100 to 235 days in Oregon and as many as 260 days in California."

Beekman, Colestine and Vermisa soils lack an argillic horizon and are less than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Pollard soils occupy gently sloping to moderately steep terraces and are clayey in the control section.  Speaker soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock."
