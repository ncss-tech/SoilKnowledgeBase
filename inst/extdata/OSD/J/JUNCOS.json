  "OVERVIEW": "The Juncos series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils on lower side slopes and foot slopes of uplands.  They formed in sediments that weathered from basic volcanic rocks. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 66 inches.  Slopes range from 5 to 20 percent.",

They formed in fine textured residuum that weathered from extrusive basic volcanic rocks and to a small degree from sediments of similar materials.  The climate is humid topical.  Slopes range from 5 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 66 inches and the average ranges from 72 to 78 degrees F."

The well drained Caguabo soils are on higher positions, are shallow to bedrock, and have loamy mixed control sections.  Junquitos soils are on lower positions, are very deep, and have very-fine mixed control sections.  The somewhat poorly drained Mabi soils are on lower adjacent alluvial fans and terraces, and are very deep.  Montegrande soils are on lower foot slope positions, are very deep, and have very-fine control sections.  Mucara soils are on similar positions, are moderately deep, and have fine-loamy mixed control sections."
