The COLE has value of 0.09 to 0.13 in the solum.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is clay.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of  7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Juncos soils are on side slopes and foot slopes of strongly dissected uplands. They formed in fine textured residuum that weathered from extrusive basic volcanic rocks and to a small degree from sediments of similar materials.  The climate is humid topical.  Slopes range from 5 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 66 inches and the average ranges from 72 to 78 degrees F."

The well drained Caguabo soils are on higher positions, are shallow to bedrock, and have loamy mixed control sections.  Junquitos soils are on lower positions, are very deep, and have very-fine mixed control sections.  The somewhat poorly drained Mabi soils are on lower adjacent alluvial fans and terraces, and are very deep.  Montegrande soils are on lower foot slope positions, are very deep, and have very-fine control sections.  Mucara soils are on similar positions, are moderately deep, and have fine-loamy mixed control sections."
