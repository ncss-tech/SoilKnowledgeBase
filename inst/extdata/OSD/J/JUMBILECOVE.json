  "OVERVIEW": "The Jumbilecove series consists of very deep, poorly drained, high saturated hydraulic conductivity (rapidly permeable) soils that formed in eolian deposits. These nearly level soils occur on vegetated tidal flats on barrier islands. Slope is less than 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1245 mm (49 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).",
