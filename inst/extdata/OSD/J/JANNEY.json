  "OVERVIEW": "The Janney series consists of moderately deep, poorly drained, moderately permeable soils in flatwoods and low hammocks of western peninsular Florida.  They formed in sandy marine sediments over limestone bedrock.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the A and E horizons and from extremely acid in the upper part of the Bh horizon to neutral in the lower part of the Bh horizon.  Reaction in any BC, C or Bt horizon ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E and Eg horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5Yr to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is sand, fine sand or loamy fine sand.\nIn some pedons, a thin, discontinuous Bt horizon is immediately above the bedrock in solution holes.  Where present this layer has color similar to that of the C horizon and has texture of sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nA BC horizon occurs below the Bh horizon in some pedons.  Where present, it has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 or less.  Texture is sand, fine sand or loamy fine sand.\nA C horizon occurs just above the bedrock in some pedons.  Where present, it has the same range of colors and textures as the BC horizon.\nThe R horizon is composed of limestone bedrock having varying degrees of hardness.  Commonly, it can be chipped, but not dug with a hand spade, but can be dug fairly easily with power machinery.  In some areas, the limestone occurs as a ledge, ranging from about 12 to 30 inches in thickness, and is underlain by material similar in color and texture to that of the C horizon."

The very poorly drained Estero soils are in lower tidal marsh areas.  Ona soils are on similar positions.  The very poorly or poorly drained St. Johns soils are on similar to slightly lower positions."

The average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 70 to 74 degrees F."

All of these soils are very poorly or poorly drained and are on similar to slightly lower positions.  Basinger, Boca, Hallandale and Holopaw soils do not have spodic horizons.  In addition, Basinger and Holopaw soils are very deep while Holopaw and Boca soils have argillic horizons.  Hallandale soils are shallow to limestone bedrock.  EauGallie, Immokalee, Myakka, Smyrna and Wabasso soils are very deep.  In addition, EauGallie and Wabasso soils have argillic horizons."

Some areas near the southern parts of the series range are used for citrus production.  The natural vegetation typically consists of an overstory of slash pine, oaks, cabbage palm, black gum and sweet gum with sawpalmetto, gallberry, blueberry, bluestems, pineland threeawn, and a variety of other grasses and forbs in the understory."
