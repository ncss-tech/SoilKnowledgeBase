    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jimek soils are on exposed mountain sides and ridges. Slopes are 5 to 60 percent. They formed in colluvium from rhyolite and tuff and volcanic ash. Elevations are 3,000 to 6,300 feet. The soils are in a continental climate with cool moist summers and cold wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 80 inches. The average January temperature is about 22 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 60 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F. and the frost-free season is 35 to 75 days. The growing season at 28 degrees F. is 80 to 110 days."
