  "OVERVIEW": "The Jimek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium from rhyolite, tuff and volcanic ash. Jimek soils are on mountain sides and ridges. Slopes are 5 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 70 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
