  "OVERVIEW": "The Jasperpeak series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from metavolcanic rocks. The Jasperpeak soils are on hills.\nSlopes range from 10 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 530 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C.",
