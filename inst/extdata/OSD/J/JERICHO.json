  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jericho soils are on fan remnants and ballenas.  These soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from igneous rocks, but includes some sedimentary rocks. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Areas with slopes over 15 percent are the result of faulting subsequent to the formation of the duripan.  Elevations range from 1,405 to 2,320 meters.  The climate is semiarid continental.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 360 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C and the mean summer temperature is 16 to 18 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."

Truesdale soils are coarse-loamy, moderately deep to duripans, and have cambic horizons and calcic horizons."
