  "OVERVIEW": "The Jericho series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from igneous rocks.  Jericho soils are on fan remnants and ballenas.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

The climate is semiarid continental.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 360 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C and the mean summer temperature is 16 to 18 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."
