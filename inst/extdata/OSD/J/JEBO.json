  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Jebo series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in colluvium derived mainly from sandstone or conglomerate composed of sandstone, limestone, and quartzite rocks.  These soils are on foothills and mountain slopes and have slopes of 15 to 40 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is about 15 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 20 inches thick.  The thickness of the solum and the depth to free carbonates typically is about 18 inches but range from 13 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments in the 10 to 40 inch depth are rounded, and range from 40 to 65 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobble.  Depth to the bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 37 to 44 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F.  The soil is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 or more consecutive days within the 4 months following the summer solstice.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.  Rock fragment content is about 40 percent with 30 to 40 percent as gravel and 0 to 10 percent as cobble.  The A horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline, and noncalcareous or slightly calcareous.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.  Rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 60 percent, with 30 to 60 percent as gravel and 0 to 15 percent as cobble.  Clay content is 15 to 22 percent. The Bw horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline, and noncalcareous to moderately calcareous.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 4 dry, 4 to 6 moist.  It ranges from very cobbly loam or extremely cobbly sandy loam to extremely gravelly loam or extremely gravelly sandy loam.  Rock fragment content is 35 to 60 percent, with 30 to 55 percent as gravel and 0 to 40 percent as cobble. Clay content is 10 to 15 percent.  The Bk horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline."
