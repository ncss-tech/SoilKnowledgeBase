  "OVERVIEW": "The Jarola series consists of deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from tuff, rhyolite and pumice.  They are on stream terraces with slopes ranging from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
