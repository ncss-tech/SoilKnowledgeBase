    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jarola series are on stream terraces and have gradients of 0 to 5 percent.  They formed in alluvium derived from extrusive and pyroclastic volcanics, mainly rhyolite, tuff and pumice. Elevations are 8,000 to 8,800 feet.  The climate is continental with mean annual precipitation of about 20 to 25 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free season is about 70 to 100 days."
