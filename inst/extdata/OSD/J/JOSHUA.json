  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to the duripan (Csics horizon) are 20 to 40 inches.  The duripan consists of discontinuous silica lenses in more than 50 percent of the horizon or has more than 50 percent very firm or extremely firm durinodes and/or pendants on the underside of rock fragments.  The mean annual soil temperature is 63 to 67 degrees F. and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F. at any time.  The soil is usually dry and is not continuously moist for as long as 60 days.  The soil is moderately to strongly saline alkali.  SAR is 13 to 35.\nThe A horizon is light yellowish brown, pale brown or very pale brown (10YR 6/4, 6/3, 7/4).  Moist colors are light yellowish brown, brown, dark yellowish brown or dark brown (10YR 6/4, 5/3, 4/4, 4/3).  Structure is weak to strong and thin to thick platy.  This horizon is sandy loam or loam and averages about 5 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.  It is mildly alkaline to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons are noncalcareous.\nThe B2t horizon is reddish brown, yellowish red, or strong brown (5YR 5/4, 4/4, 5/6; 7.5YR 5/6).  Moist colors are reddish brown, yellowish red, or dark brown (5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/6; 7.5YR 4/4).  This horizon is gravelly sandy clay loam or gravelly heavy sandy loam with 15 to 35 percent fine gravel.  Clay ranges from 18 to 30 percent and increase by 3 to 10 percent clay from the A horizon to the Bt horizon.  Reaction is mildly alkaline to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a B3 horizon.\nThe C horizon is white, or very pale brown (10YR 8/2, 8/3, 7/4).  Moist colors are pale brown, light yellowish brown, light gray or very pale brown (1YR 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3).  This horizon is very gravelly loam coarse sand or very gravelly coarse sandy loam with 35 to 60 percent fine gravel that grades into cobbly material as depth increases.  In some pedons it is made up of durinodes or silica coatings on coarse fragments."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Caudle, Cuddeback, Dateland, Harqua, Ligurta, Nyala, Unsel and Vigus series in other families.  Caudle, Nyala, Unsel and Vigus soils have mesic soil temperature.  Cuddeback soils have a continuous indurated duripan and an SAR less than 10.  Dateland, Harqua and Ligurta soils have hyperthermic soil temperature and lack a duripan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Joshua soils are on old gravelly erosion pavement covered terraces and have gradients of 2 to 15 percent.  They formed in mixed alluvium derived from granitic and volcanic rocks.  Elevation s are 2,600 to 3,000 feet.  A well developed erosion pavement covers from 70 to 90 percent of the surface.  The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool partly moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 4 or 5 inches, most of the moisture falls as rain in the winter.  Some moisture falls occasionally as snow.  The average January temperature is 46 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 84 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 61 to 65 degrees F.  The frost free season is 210 to 255 days."
