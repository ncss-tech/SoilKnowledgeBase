  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Juva series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Juva soils are on fan skirts, basin-floor remnants, and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.   The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
