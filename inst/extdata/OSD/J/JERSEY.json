  "OVERVIEW": "The Jersey series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from interbedded sandstone and shale.  Jersey soils are on mountain slopes and canyon sideslopes.  Slopes range from 30 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
