    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 36 to 38 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 55 to 57 degrees F.  In most years there are cracks one centimeter wide at a depth of 20 inches that are open for 30 to 60 days.  Surface horizons that have color value, dry, of less than 5.5 and a color value, moist, of less than 3.5 have a combined thickness of 5 to 11 inches.  Depth to distinct mottling is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section has 40 to 60 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 when dry, 3 or 4 when moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is clay or silty clay. Reaction is strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is clay or silty clay. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral."

Elevation ranges from 7,800 to 8,400 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 35 to 37 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 30 to 60 days.  More than one-half of the precipitation falls as snow in the winter."
