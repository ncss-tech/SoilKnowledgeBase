  "OVERVIEW": "The Jokodowski series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium and residuum derived from shale.  Jokodowski soils are on hillsides.  Slopes range from 3 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",

In most years there are cracks one centimeter wide at a depth of 20 inches that are open for 30 to 60 days.  Surface horizons that have color value, dry, of less than 5.5 and a color value, moist, of less than 3.5 have a combined thickness of 5 to 11 inches.  Depth to distinct mottling is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section has 40 to 60 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 when dry, 3 or 4 when moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is clay or silty clay. Reaction is strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is clay or silty clay. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral."
