  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Jade Run soils were previously mapped in New Jersey as Pasquotank soils. Pasquotank soils are in a thermic temperature regime and are in a coarse-silty particle-size family. Particle-size data from several pedons within 3 counties in New Jersey supports a coarse-loamy family. Jade Run soils occur adjacent to landforms and soils with higher glauconite content, and may contain few glauconite pellets in the reworked marine materials from which the soils formed. Unconforming materials and the presence of a lithological discontinuity (2C horizon) are not a series requirement. Pedons that do not have unconforming 2C materials are not significantly different in use and management. 05/2002.  The series was reclassified from Humaquepts to Endoaquepts.  The dry color of the surface horizon was determined to be consistently greater than 5 and moist color, although typically 2 or 3, ranging from 1 to 4. The 2/2003 revision changes the OSD name from Jaderun to Jade Run to address naming convention concerns at the local level. The 5/2004 revision updates series status and adds date established.\nDiagnostic horizons and other soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 11 inches (Ap\nhorizon)\nCambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 11 to 52 inches (Bg and BCg horizons)\nAquic conditions--the zone from 0 to 80 inches is periodically saturated (endosaturation)\nOther soil features identified with this pedon:\nLithologic Discontinuity--contrasting sand sizes at a depth of 52 inches (2Cg and 2C horizons)\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nReference particle-size data is available from the project soil survey staff, Hammonton, New Jersey.\nDatabase Information:\nOSD Data Mapunit ID: To be developed\nTypical Pedon Data Mapunit ID: 407397\nOSD User Pedon ID: Jade Run-OSD\nRevised: 11/2002-SCK, JAK; 2/2003-DHK; 5/2004-DHK\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
