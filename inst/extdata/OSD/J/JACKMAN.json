  "OVERVIEW": "The Jackman series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium and slope alluvium from glacial drift derived from dunite.  Jackman soils are on glacially modified mountains and have slopes of 30 to 65 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F, and the average annual precipitation is 85 inches.",
