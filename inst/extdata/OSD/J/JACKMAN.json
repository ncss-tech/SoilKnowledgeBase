The soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium and slope alluvium from glacial till influenced by dunite.  The average annual precipitation is 75 to 90 inches.  They are in a marine climate with cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  The average January temperature is about 30 degrees F., and the average July temperature is about 57 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 110 days."
