Reaction of the series control section is extremely acid to strongly acid. Redoxomorphic features are present throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 0 to 2. In cultivated areas, the Ap horizon has value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. The A or Ap horizon is silty clay or clay.\nThe Bg or Bssg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture is silty clay or clay.\nThe BCg, BCssg or Cg horizon, where present, has colors and textures similar to the Bg or Bssg horizons."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the only series in this family. In related families, are the Alligator, Booker, Cape, Carlow, Karnak, Okaw, Perry, Salzer, Sharkey, and Zipp soils. Alligator, Perry, and Sharkey soils are thermic. In addition, Perry and Sharkey soils are less acid in the series control section. Booker and Carlow soils have mollic epipedons. Cape, Karnak, Okaw, Salzer, and Zipp soils contain less clay in the particle-size control section. In addition, Karnak and Zipp soils are less acid in the series control section, and Zipp soils do not shrink and swell as much as Jacob soils. Also the Okaw soils have an albic horizon and an argillic horizon and Salzer soils are in a different climate."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jacob soils are on low-lying flood plains and terraces, principally along the Mississippi River and the larger tributaries to it. Slope gradients commonly are less than 1 percent, but range to 2 percent. Jacob soils formed in clayey slack water sediments. Winters are cold and summers are hot. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 48 inches, frost free period ranges from 180 to 210 days, and elevation ranges from 340 to 450 feet above mean sea level."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: 1. These soils are in a geographic area that is transitional from mesic to thermic temperature regimes. Air temperature data and soil investigation in the vicinity of the type location suggest that the average annual soil temperature is near 59 degrees F. Its most common associates are also mesic soils.\n2. Jacob soils were previous classified as:\na. Very-fine, smectitic, acid, mesic Vertic Endoaquepts; classification was\nadjusted to agree with ST Issue #17 on 23 Aug 94 by CLG.\nb. Very fine, montmorillonitic, acid, mesic Vertic Haplaquepts \t(Classification as of January 1979).\nc. Alluvial soils intergrading toward Low-Humic Gley soils in the 1938\nclassification by great group system.\n3. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon: the zone from 0 to 4 inches (A horizon).\nb. Cambic horizon - the zone from 4 to 60 inches (Bg1, Bg2, Bg3 and Bssg\nhorizons).\nc. Vertic subgroup feature - clay and silty clay texture with pressure faces\non the faces of peds and slickensides in \tthe series control section.\nd. Aquic moisture regime - aquic conditions and a chroma of 2 or less in the \tzone from 0 to 60 inches.\ne. Redoximorphic features: the zone from 0 to 60 inches\n4. The NASIS Data Mapunit ID is: 133697. This data mapunit represents the OSD\npedon for Jacob.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
