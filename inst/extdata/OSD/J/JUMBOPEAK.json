  "OVERVIEW": "The Jumbopeak series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from granite, gneiss and schist. Jumbopeak soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
