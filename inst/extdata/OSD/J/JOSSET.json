  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the summer months. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick. The particle-size control section above the very gravelly sand is a loam or fine sandy loam with about 10 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. The lower part of the control section is sand or loamy sand with 35 to 65 percent gravel. Depth to very gravelly sand is 20 to 36 inches. The solum is slightly to moderately alkaline and calcareous throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It has 0 to 5 percent gravel. It has 1 to 2 percent CaCO3 equivalent.\nThe C1 horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is loam or fine sandy loam with 0 to 20 percent gravel. It has 1 to 2 percent CaCO3 equivalent.\nThe 2C2 horizon is sand or loamy sand and is very gravelly or extremely gravelly. It has 35 to 65 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils have formed in stratified alluvium weathered from basalt, granite, and limestone with an influence of alluvial loess and volcanic ash in the surface. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations are 3,400 to 4,400 feet. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 17 inches. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."

Lostine and Redmount soils are on slightly higher terraces and lack irregular decrease in organic matter and lack contrasting textures within 40 inches."
