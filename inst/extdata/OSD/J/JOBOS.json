  "OVERVIEW": "The Jobos series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils formed in coastal plain clays overlain by sandy sediments.  They are gently sloping and sloping soils in the coastal plain.  These soils are sandy loam, nonplastic in the A horizon and have clay, plastic thick B horizon with plinthite.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum is over 60 inches.  Thickness of the argillic horizon is over 50 inches.  Content of plinthite in the B horizon varies from 6 to 30 percent.  Clay films in the B horizon varies from thin patchy to thick continuous.  Reaction ranges from strongly to extremely acid in the whole profile.  The mean annual soil temperature is 75 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hues of 10YR, values of 3 and 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is dominantly sandy loam.  Structure is weak fine or medium granular or subangular blocky parting to single grain.  Thickness of the A horizon is 6 to 19 inches.\nThe B2t horizons have red, strong brown, light gray, yellowish brown, and dark red colors in varying proportions in a reticulate pattern.  Texture is clay.  Structure varies from weak to strong and from medium to coarse subangular blocky.  Consistence is slightly sticky or sticky and plastic."

The Almirante, Cabo Rojo, Cidral, Espinosa, Guanajibo, Guerrero, Maleza, Sosa, Torres and Vega Alta series are similar soils in related families.  The Almirante and Guanajibo soils lack the low chroma mottles.  The Bejucos, Cidral, Espinosa and Maleza soils lack the nonindurated plinthite within 60 inches from the surface.  The Cabo Rojo and Vega Alta soils have mixed mineralogy in the clay fraction.  The Guerrero soils have thicker sandy surface layers.  The Sosa soils have ustic moisture regimes.  The Torres soils have higher organic matter content in the upper argillic horizons."
