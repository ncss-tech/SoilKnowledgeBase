They formed in silty alluvium derived from limestone, sandstone, siltstone, shale, and loess. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 55 to 58 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 40 to 46 inches."

Bearthicket, Horsecreek, Pinerun, and Secesh soils have argillic horizons and are on slightly higher landscape positions.  Cedargap soils have a mollic epipedon, are loamy-skeletal, and are on similar landscape positions."

Laboratory data shows clay activity of this series is borderline to active. The type location is 0.57 CEC/clay ratio but the representative value of all pedons sampled is between 0.60 and 0.65.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
