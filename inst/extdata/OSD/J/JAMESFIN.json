  "OVERVIEW": "The Jamesfin series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in silty alluvium derived from limestone, sandstone, siltstone, shale, and loess. These nearly level soils are on flood plains and low stream terraces of major streams and rivers. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 44 inches.",
