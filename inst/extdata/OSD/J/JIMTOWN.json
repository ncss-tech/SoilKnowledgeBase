    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 25 to 46 inches. Thickness of the solum ranges from 25 to 54 inches. Rock fragments are dominantly sandstone and shale, with a significant portion of igneous pebbles and cobbles. The particle size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay and 20 to 55 percent sand.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 (6 or more dry) and chroma of 1 to 3. Some pedons have an A horizon up to 5 inches thick that has value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry) and chroma of 1 or 2. Textures are loam, silt loam, sandy loam, or their gravelly analogues. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have an E horizon up to 8 inches thick that has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 (7 or 8 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture and reaction are like the A horizon.\nSome pedons have a BE horizon.\nThe Bt and Btg horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. Textures typically are loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or their gravelly and very gravelly analogues. Some pedons have horizons of fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Some pedons have horizons of silt loam or silty clay loam to a depth of 24 inches. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 30 percent in the upper part and from 5 to 60 percent in the lower part. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BCtg, BCt, BCg, and BC horizons have hue of 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. Textures are loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, and their gravelly, very gravelly, and extremely gravelly analogues. Rock fragment content averages between 15 and 50 percent but ranges from 0 to 75 percent. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 6. Textures are loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or sand, coarse sand and their gravelly, very gravelly, and extremely gravelly analogues. Rock fragment content averages between 15 and 60 percent, but ranges from 0 to 85 percent. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Some pedons range to moderately alkaline below 60 inches. Some pedons have carbonates in the lower part."

Angola, Mitiwanga, Nuhi, and Shadeland soils have a lithic contact before 40 inches. Appleton, Darien, and Ovid soils have sola shallower than 54 inches and are formed in till. Ayshire, Crawleyville, and Whitaker soils have less rock fragments in the subsoil and substratum. Burdett soils have higher clay content in the substratum. Digby and Sleeth soils are more alkaline in the substratum. Mongle soils have a higher mean annual temperature."
