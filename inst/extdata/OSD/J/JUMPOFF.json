  "OVERVIEW": "The Jumpoff series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from tuff and volcanic breccia. Jumpoff soils are on hillslopes and have slopes of 7 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry throughout the control section for 45 to 70 consecutive days during the summer. During the winter and spring, depth to water table ranges from 2.5 to 3.5 feet. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 54 degrees F. Depth to a paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches. Rock fragments in the control section range from 0 to 15 percent pebbles and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist and 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. It is clay or cobbly clay and averages 40 to 50 percent clay. It has moderate or strong medium to coarse subangular blocky or prismatic structure."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bateman, Freezener, Lettia, Melbourne, Munset, Napavine, Oak Grove, Oakland, Rainier, Secata, and Veneta series. Bateman soils are heavy silt clay loam or silty clay in the B horizon, and have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR in the B horizon. Freezener soils have hue redder than 10YR and are strongly acid or very strongly acid in the lower part of the B horizon. Lettia soils have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and greater than 25 percent medium and coarse sands in the Bt horizon. Manzanita soils have hue as red as 5YR in all or in some part of the argillic horizon, have a mean annual soil temperature warmer than 55 degrees F., are dry for more than 90 consecutive days, and have distinct high chroma mottles in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Melbourne soils are well drained and are deeper than 60 inches to water table and bedrock. Munset soils are well drained and are deeper than 60 inches to water table and bedrock. Munset soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Napavine soils have an umbric epipedon. Oak Grove soils have an umbric epipedon and have hue redder than 7.5YR in the argillic horizon. Oakland soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Rainier soils have an umbric epipedon and are strongly acid. Secata soils have mean annual soil temperature of 56 to 58 degrees F. and are neutral or mildly alkaline in the argillic horizon. Veneta soils have 60 percent or more clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon."

These soils formed in colluvium weathered from tuffs and volcanic breccia. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist with an average annual precipitation of 35 to 45 inches. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F.; and the frost free period is 100 to 170 days."
