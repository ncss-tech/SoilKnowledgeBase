    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to duripan is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.  The soils have cracks 1 to 4 cm wide at a depth of 20 or more inches.  The cracks open and close once each year.  They are open through the summer and fall and are closed during the winter and spring.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline above 15 inches and moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline below 15 inches.  Effervescence occurs below 15 inches.\nThe A horizon dry color is dominantly 10YR 5/1, 4/1, 3/1, or N 3/0 with a mixture in some pedons of 10YR 4/3, 4/2, or 3/2.  Moist colors are dominantly 10YR 3/1, 2/1, N 3/0, or N 2/0 with a mixture in some pedons of 10YR 3/3, or 3/2.  It is clay or silty clay.\nThe Bk or 2Bqk horizon has dry color of 10YR 7/2, 6/1, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4 5/4, 5/1, or 4/1 and moist color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/1, 4/1, 3/1 or 2.5Y 5/2.  It has distinct or prominent mottles, or iron-manganese concretions, or both.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay or clay.  The 2Bk horizon, is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam and contains 0 to 15 percent hard durinodes which are counted as gravel.\nThe 2Bqkm horizon has dry color of 7.5Y 5/6, 6/4; 10YR 6/1, 5/6, 5/4, 4/4, 4/3, 5/2 or 4/2.  Moist colors are 7.5Y 4/4; 10YR 5/1, 5/4, 4/4, 4/3, 5/2 or 4/2.  It is strongly cemented to indurated with silica and carbonates in 60 to 90 percent of the horizon.  Carbonates are disseminated or segregated in soft masses.  A laminar cap is indurated or thin laminar bands are indurated below the upper boundary.\nThe 3Bqkm horizon has similar colors as the 2Bkqm horizon.  It is weakly to strongly cemented with silica and carbonates in 30 to 70 percent of the horizon.  Carbonates are either disseminated or segregated."

Depth to water table is presently greater than 5 feet because of pumping and deep drainage ditches.  The soil may be saturated above the duripan with a perched water table for short periods after heavy rains during the winter months."
