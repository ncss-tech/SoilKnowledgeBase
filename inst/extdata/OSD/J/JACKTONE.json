They are open through the summer and fall and are closed during the winter and spring.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline above 15 inches and moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline below 15 inches.  Effervescence occurs below 15 inches.\nThe A horizon dry color is dominantly 10YR 5/1, 4/1, 3/1, or N 3/0 with a mixture in some pedons of 10YR 4/3, 4/2, or 3/2.  Moist colors are dominantly 10YR 3/1, 2/1, N 3/0, or N 2/0 with a mixture in some pedons of 10YR 3/3, or 3/2.
