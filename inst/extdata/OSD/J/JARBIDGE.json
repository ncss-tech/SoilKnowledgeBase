Cobblank soils have a udic moisture regime and have mean annual soil temperature of less than 5 degrees C.  Cowood soils are dominated by channers in the particle-size control section and have an udic moisture regime.  Hechtman soils are dominated by gravel in the particle-size control section, have mean annual soil temperature of 0 to 2 degrees C, and have an udic moisture regime.  Hotter soils have a udic moisture regime and have mean annual soil temperature of 1 to 3 degrees C.  Merino soils have a udic moisture regime that borders on ustic.  Pendergrass soils are dominated by channers in the particle-size control section, have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, and have an ustic moisture regime.  Sigbird soils have an ustic moisture regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevations range from 2,445 to 3,025 meters.  The climate is subhumid with cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 630 to 900 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."

Further study is needed to determine base saturation in these soils for accurate great group placement.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
