  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon, thickness of the silty mantle, and depth to sandy alluvium all range from 40 to 60 inches. The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay. The content of fine sand or coarser is less than 15 percent in the silty mantle. Carbonates are absent to 80 inches or more. Rock fragments are absent in the silty mantle and the content of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the sandy alluvium. Reaction commonly ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the pedon but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed. Redox accumulations occur within 72 inches and commonly occur within 40 inches. Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are in the lower part of the series control section in some pedons. Saturation occurs at a depth of 40 to 72 inches for 1 month or more per year in 6 or more out of 10 years. In many pedons, saturation occurs within 40 inches for less than 1 month per year or less than 6 out of 10 years, or both.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Where moist value is 3, dry value is 6 or more. Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture of the Ap or A horizon is silt loam.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam\nSome pedons have a 2Bt horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. Texture is typically stratified dominantly with silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam and has thin strata of coarser texture. In some pedons it is not stratified.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is stratified fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand. Thin strata of finer texture are in some pedons."
