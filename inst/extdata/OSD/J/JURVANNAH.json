  "OVERVIEW": "The Jurvannah series consists of deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from granitic rocks. Jurvannah soils are on alluvial fans, low stream terraces, or flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

A fluctuating water table ranges from about 18- to 36-inch depth in spring and early summer for about two months. Base saturation ranges from about 50 to 75 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe C horizon is stratified with sand, gravelly sand or very gravelly sand and contains 5 to 50 percent gravel. This horizon has thin strata of sandy loam in some pedons. Between depths of 10 and 40 inches the soil averages 35 to 45 percent fine gravel. Mottles occur between depths of 6 and 20 inches."
