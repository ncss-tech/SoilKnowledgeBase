A fluctuating water table ranges from about 18- to 36-inch depth in spring and early summer for about two months. Base saturation ranges from about 50 to 75 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe C horizon is stratified with sand, gravelly sand or very gravelly sand and contains 5 to 50 percent gravel. This horizon has thin strata of sandy loam in some pedons. Between depths of 10 and 40 inches the soil averages 35 to 45 percent fine gravel. Mottles occur between depths of 6 and 20 inches."

Mean annual precipitation is 22 to 24 inches. mean annual temperature is 38 degrees to 40 degrees F., and mean summer temperature is 53 degrees to 55 degrees F. Frost-free season is 50 to 70 days."
