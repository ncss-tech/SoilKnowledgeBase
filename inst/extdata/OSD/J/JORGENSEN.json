  "OVERVIEW": "The Jorgensen series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in loess, volcanic ash, and glacial outwash derived from dunite.  Jorgensen soils are on outwash terraces and have slopes of 3 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 90 to 100 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
