  "OVERVIEW": "The James series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils formed in clayey alluvium on floodplains.  Permeability is slow or very slow.  Slopes are less than l percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:   Thickness of mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to over 60 inches. Redoximorphic features in many pedons are masked by the dark matrix colors.  Free carbonate is at or within 10 inches of the surface.  The particle size control section is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay averaging between 35 and 60 percent clay, but some layers will exceed 60 percent clay. Buried horizons are common below depths of 20 inches but are at depths of less than 20 inches in some pedons.  The electrical conductivity ranges from about 8 to 20 or more mmhos/cm in the upper part of the pedon. Visible accumulations of salts range from few to many and fine to medium in the solum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or less.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe Bz horizon  has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and 2 to 4 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.   Some pedons have faint or distinct redoximorphic features.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have Bzy, Bkg, or BC horizons.\nThe Ab horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y or neutral, value of 2 or 3 and 2 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  It typically is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay, but some pedons have thin strata of coarser materials below depths of 40 inches.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Some buried layers do not have carbonates.\nThe C horizon  has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 to 5 and 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam, but some pedons have thin layers of silty and loamy materials. It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Baltic, Holly Springs, Knoke, and Nishna series in the same family. The Baltic, Holly Springs, Knoke, and Nishna soils do not have salts in the solum.  In addition, Baltic and Nishna soils typically do not have buried horizons. Holly Springs and Nishna soils typically do not have gypsum crystals within the series control section and Holly Springs soils contain less clay in the upper part of solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The James soils are nearly level on plane to slightly concave floodplains. They are mainly on low flats that entrap water, at the base of foot slopes some distance from the present stream channel or in abandoned stream channels.  Slope gradients are less than 1 percent.  They formed in clayey alluvium. The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 26 inches."

Clamo soils do not have carbonate in the upper part of the solum and contain less salts.  Lamo soils are fine-silty and contain less salts.  Salmo soils are fine-silty and are on similar landscapes.  Wann soils are coarse-loamy and are on higher parts of the floodplain."
