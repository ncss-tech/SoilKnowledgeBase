  "OVERVIEW": "The Jenks series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from soft sandstone or shale.  Jenks soils are on hills and have slopes of 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

The moisture control section between depths of 6 and 18 inches is moist in some parts for at least 90 days from December until May and is moist in all parts from 45 consecutive days between mid-January and mid-March.  The soil is dry for about 210 days and has a Xeric bordering on an Aridic moisture regime.  The soil is, clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3; 2.5YR 4/2 or 5/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3; 2.5YR 3/2.  Gravel content is 0 to 15 percent.\nThe B horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3 or 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4 or 5/4.
