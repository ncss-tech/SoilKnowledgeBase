Elevations are 800 to 1585 meters. The climate is warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1235 to 1970 mm, of which 3 to 15 percent falls as snow. Snow covers the higher elevations from December until March. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 to 14 degrees C. Mean January temperature is about 4 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 24 degrees C. Frost-free season is about 170 to 225 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fiddletown, Hartless, Horseshoe, Mariposa and Sites soils. Fiddletown and Hartless soils do not have argillic horizons, have a lithic contact at 100 to 150 cm, and occur on backslopes and shoulders of mountain slopes. Horseshoe soils formed in gravelly Tertiary terrace remnants and basic volcanic rocks (dominantly andesitic tuff breccia) and occur on backslopes, summits or footslopes of broad tabular ridges. Mariposa soils occur in similar hillslope positions as Jocal and are 50 to 100 cm to a paralithic contact of metasedimentary rock. Sites soils have more than 35 percent clay in the upper argillic horizon, have parasesquic mineralogy, and occur on more stable backslopes and summits of mountain slopes."
