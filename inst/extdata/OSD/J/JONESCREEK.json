  "OVERVIEW": "The Jonescreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium or outwash from mixed sources.  These soils occur on flood plains, flood plain steps, stream terraces, and outwash terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
