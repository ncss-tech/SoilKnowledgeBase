Depth to the water table ranges from 0.5 to 4 feet throughout the year.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2.5 or 2, and chroma of 1or 2. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Ag horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. The texture is mucky silt loam or silt loam modified by 10 to 50 percent coarse fragments, 5 to 25 percent gravel, 5 to 35 percent cobbles, and 0 to 3 percent stones. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe 2Cg horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid and may range to moderately acid below 20 inches from the mineral soil surface."
