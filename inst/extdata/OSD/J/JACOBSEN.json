  "REVDATE": "04/2003",
  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Jacobsen series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium overlying gravelly glacial drift. Jacobsen soils are in depression on till plains, drainageways, and hills. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F.",

Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Ag horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. The texture is mucky silt loam or silt loam modified by 10 to 50 percent coarse fragments, 5 to 25 percent gravel, 5 to 35 percent cobbles, and 0 to 3 percent stones. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe 2Cg horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid and may range to moderately acid below 20 inches from the mineral soil surface."
