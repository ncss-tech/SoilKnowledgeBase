Rock fragments are Triassic sandstone, conglomerate and rounded quartz gravels from the weathered conglomerate. Unlimed reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Ap or A horizons have hue of 10YR to 5YR, Value of 3 to 5, and Chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Structure is weak fine granular or weak fine subangular blocky.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  Structure is moderate fine to coarse subangular blocky.\nThe C horizon has the same color ranges as the Bt.

Arcola soils are less than 60 inches to bedrock or Cr horizons.  Bedington and Shelocta soils have an argillic horizon extending below 40 inches and have higher chroma Bt horizons.  Bucks soils have a silty loess influenced upper solum with less than 5 percent rock fragments and bedrock at less than 50 inches. Collington, Freehold and Wist soils contain glauconite.  Edgemont, Edneytown, Quakertown, Pineville and Rayne soils have B horizons with hue of 7.5YR or yellower.  Germania series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvial fans.  Gilpin, and Syenite soils have bedrock between 20 and 40 inches. Gladstone soils are well drained formed in residuum and colluvium from granitic gneiss. Leedsville soils formed in residuum from Triassic-Jurassic interbedded sandstone and conglomerate of the Culpeper Basin. Millstone soils formed in loamy alluvium. Pennval are well drained soils formed in colluvium from interbedded shale and siltstone, or sandstone on footslopes of prominent valley ridges. Pigeonroost soils formed in residuum affected by soil creep in the upper part and weathered from felsic to mafic, igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks.\nSoils in closely related families are: The Albemarle, Allegheny, Allenwood, Arendtsville, Aura, Birdsboro, Brasstown, Butano, Chester, Chetwynd, Chillmark, Clymer, Cowee, Elsinboro, Eubanks, Frankstown, Glenelg, Junaluska, Leck Kill, Lonon, Meadowville, Murrill, Nixon, Shouns, Tate, Thurmont, Ungers, and Whiteford.

Arendtsville soils have rock fragments of aporhyolite. Birdsboro soils are on terraces and formed in old alluvial deposits and do not have angular fragments of traissic sandstone in the solum.  Brasstown, Cowee, Junaluska soils are less than 60 inches to bedrock or Cr horizons. Butano soils have bedrock between 20 and 40 inches. Chester, Glenelg, and Tate soils have rock fragments of gneiss, granite, or schist. Chetwynd, soils have hues yellowier than 5YR. Chilmark and Clymer soils have B horizons with hue of 7.5YR or yellowier. Elsinboro soils contain fragments of mica, particularly in the lower part of the solum and C horizon underlain by stratified sand and gravel. Eubanks soils have angular quartz sand grains in the solum. Frankstown soils have rock fragments of limestone and/or chert. Leck Kill soils have a channery rock fragments and do not contain rounded fragments of quartz. Meadowville soils contain mica. Murrill soils have a solum greater than 60 inches thick. Nixon soils have quartzite rock fragments, 70 percent of which are cobble size. Shouns soils formed in colluvium from sandstone, siltstone, and shale. They are on the lower part of hillsides, benches, and foot slopes and commonly have silty clay loam Bt horizons. Ungers soils formed in residuum from red sandstone and shale and are in MLRA 147 on mountain ridge tops. Whiteford formed in residuum from dark colored slate and/or phyllite."
