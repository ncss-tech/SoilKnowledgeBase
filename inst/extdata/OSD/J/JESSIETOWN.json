  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to hard bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent in the upper solum and from few to 35 percent in the lower solum and\nsubstratum.  Fragments are mostly weathered and unweathered black, fissile, carbonaceous shale.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid throughout the profile.  Where limed, the upper sola ranges to neutral.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4, but to a depth of 7 inches after mixing the Ap has value moist of 4 or more.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  In some pedons the Bt horizons has mottles in shades of brown, yellow, or red and in the lower part shades of gray.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6.\nThe 2C horizon, if present, has colors and textures similar to the B horizon.\nThe 2Cr horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is weathered shale.\nThe 2R horizon is hard fissile shale."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chillum, Fletcher, Greenbriar, Kurtz, Talleyville, Wernock, and Whitley series.  Chillum soils have a thinner solum, Fletcher so11s formed in residuum weathered in phyllite, and Greenbriar soils formed in similar materials to the Jessietown soils but are more than 40 inches to hard bedrock.  Kurtz soils formed over noncarbonaceous shale and siltstone and are more than 40 inches to bedrock.  Talleyville soils have a thicker solum and formed in a silty mantle underlain by residuum weathered from igneous rock.  Wernock soils formed in residuum weathered from interbedded sandstone, siltstone, or noncarbonaceous shale.  Whitley soils have solum and depth to bedrock greater than 40 inches and are on stream terraces."

They formed in a thin mantle of silty material and residuum weathered from black carbonaceous fissile shale.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 49 inches."
