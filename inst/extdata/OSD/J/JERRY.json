  "OVERVIEW": "The Jerry series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvial and colluvial sediments or residuum derived mainly from sandstone, shale, breccia, and tuff.  These soils are on upland hills, mountain slopes, ridges, benches, and mesa tops.  Slopes are 1 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges 35 to 44 degrees F.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches, depth to secondary lime ranges from 15 to 40 inches, and thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 50 inches.  Organic carbon in the mollic epipedon ranges from .8 to 2 percent and decreases uniformly with increasing depth.  The soil is 90 to 100 percent base saturated.  Cation exchange capacity ranges from approximately 60 to 90 milliequivalents per 100 grams of clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in a majority of the particle-size control section and are mainly of pebble size, but includes channers up to 6 inches in length and some angular cobble.  Some pedons have polygenetic horizons in the lower parts and soft bedrock may occur at depths of 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from soft to slightly hard.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It usually has prismatic to subangular blocky structure but has angular blocky structure in some pedons.   The Bt horizon may be modified with gravel or channers.  Textures are clay loam, silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay and has 35 to 55 percent clay.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It ranges from pH 8.0 to 8.6, and the calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from approximately 4 to 13 percent.  Textures are silty clay loam, silty clay, clay or clay loam, and loam is common below 40 inches."

Beaverdam, Brinkert, Gothic, Helmet, Sessions, and Youman soils lack lime carbonate above a depth of 40 inches and do not have k horizons.  Judy, Little Horn, and Sneffels soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Buckskin and Sessions soils have sola more than 50 inches thick.  Florissant, Mayoworth, Owen Creek, Piltz, and Trout Creek have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Heath and Heathcoat soils have calcic horizons.  Blackhorse soils have more than 45 percent silt in the Bt horizon and have lime carbonate above 15 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in locally transported alluvial and colluvial sediments or residuum derived principally from sandstone and shale Breccia and/or Tuff, but having a mixture of other crystalline rocks in places.  The average annual precipitation is 16 to 30 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the spring and late summer.  The mean annual temperature is 36 to 42 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 54 to 59 degrees F.  Elevation is 7,000 to 10,000 feet in the state from north to south.  The frost-free period ranges from 50 to 75 days."
