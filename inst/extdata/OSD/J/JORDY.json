These soils are usually moist in the moisture control section but are dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick and has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.35 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, including 10 to 30 percent sand-size pumice, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent, 0 to 3 percent basalt gravel, and an apparent field estimated clay content of 5 to 14 percent. The particle size control section contains 10 to 18 percent clay and has 15 percent or more fine sand coarser. Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. Reaction is moderately acid or neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist. It has 0 to 15 percent gravel. Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline."

Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. These soils usually occur on aspects other than north. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches. Average January temperature is about 26 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 70 degrees F. and average annual air temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F. Frost-free season is 110 to 165 days."

Argabak soils are on ridgetops, hill slopes and benches of uplands, are loamy-skeletal and are very shallow to a lithic contact. Dougville soils are on side slopes of uplands and are deep or very deep. Camaspatch soils are hillslopes, escarpments and canyon walls and are clayey-skeletal."
