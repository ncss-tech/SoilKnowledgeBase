  "OVERVIEW": "The Jordy series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in loess mixed with volcanic ash over older loess underlain by basalt bedrock. Jordy soils are on nonglaciated plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The particle size control section contains 10 to 18 percent clay and has 15 percent or more fine sand coarser. Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. Reaction is moderately acid or neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist. It has 0 to 15 percent gravel.
