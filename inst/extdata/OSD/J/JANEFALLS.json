  "OVERVIEW": "The Janefalls series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from limestone. The Janefalls soils are on backslopes of mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
