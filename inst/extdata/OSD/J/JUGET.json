  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 20 inches thick and depth to the lithic contact is 7 to 20 inches.  The soils are slightly acid to neutral throughout.  Organic carbon in the mollic epipedon is 0.6 to 2 percent and decreases uniformly with increasing depth.  The soils are 60 to 100 percent base saturated.  The particle size control section is very gravelly sand or loamy sand excluding any loamy very fine sand.  These soils have a high proportion of medium and coarse angular sand in the sand fraction.  Packing patterns tend to be cubical and horizons of low organic matter content have an unusually great differential in consistence between moist and dry conditions.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 46 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 70 degrees F.  The soil temperature is 41 degrees F, or higher for less than 230 days.  The soils are dry more than one-half the time.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It usually has granular structure but it is subangular blocky in some pedons.  It is soft to slightly hard.  It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline (pH 6.1 to 7.8).\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline (pH 6.1 to 7.8) with little change with depth.  It is unusually hard for a sandy soil."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.  The Comodore and Falcon series are similar.  Comodore soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the control section.  Falcon soils have a gravelly sandy loam control section with less than 35 percent coarse fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Juget soils are on mountain side slopes, hills, and ridges in the foothill and mountain areas.  Slopes range from 6 to about 60 percent.  The soil formed in thin noncalcareous very gravelly coarse-textured materials weathered from granite bedrock.  At the type location, the average annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 24 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual air temperature is 41 to 46 degrees F, and mean summer temperature is about 57 degrees F.   The frost-free period is about 80 to 120 days.  Elevation ranges from 6,300 to 8,200 feet."
