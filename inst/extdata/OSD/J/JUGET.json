  "OVERVIEW": "The Juget series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in thin noncalcareous very gravelly coarse-textured materials weathered from granite bedrock. Juget soils are on mountain side slopes, hills, and ridges. Slopes range from 6 to about 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 510 cm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
