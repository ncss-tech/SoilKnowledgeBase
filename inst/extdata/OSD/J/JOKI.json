  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Joki series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of a sandy eolian or glaciolacustrine mantle and in the underlying clayey glaciolacustrine deposits. These soils are on flats on glacial lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 670 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
