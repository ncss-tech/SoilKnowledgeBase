  "STATES": "ND",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Janesburg series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum weathered from alkaline, soft shale, siltstone and mudstone.  These soils have slow or very slow permeability.  They are on upland plains and have slopes of 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.",

Depth to visible salt or gypsum accumulation is more than 16 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam.  It is medium acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam.  It is medium acid to neutral.  In some cultivated pedons the E horizon has been mixed with the Ap horizon.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is silty clay, clay, silty clay loam or clay loam, but some is sandy clay containing 35 to 50 percent clay.  It has strong columnar structure in the upper part grading to moderate or strong prismatic and blocky in the lower part.  The B horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline in the upper part and slightly to strongly alkaline in the lower part.  The exchangeable sodium exceeds 15 percent or the sodium plus magnesium exceeds calcium plus hydrogen.  Some pedons have salt or gypsum accumulation in the lower part of the B horizon.  Some pedons have Btkn, Bk, Bz or By horizons.\nThe BCk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, silty clay loam or silty clay.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon is alkaline, soft shale, siltstone or mudstone.  Some pedons have a C horizon above the Cr horizon.  It has gypsum accumulations in some pedons."

Belfield, Daglum and Rhoades soils are on nearby foot slopes, swales and terraces.  These soils do not have soft bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  In addition, Belfield soils have interfingering of an E horizon into the Btn horizon and do not have strong columnar structure.  Dogtooth soils are on similar positions as Janesburg soils.  They have thinner sola and have salts within 16 inches.  None of the other soils have natric horizons.  In addition, Cabba soils have soft bedrock within depths of 20 inches.  They are on nearby knobs and ridges.  The other soils are on nearby terraces and uplands."
