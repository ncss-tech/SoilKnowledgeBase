All of these soils are very deep, and none of them have an argillic horizon below 100 centimeters. Carsitas, Lagunita, Myoma and Pintobasin soils are formed in alluvium while Dalelake and Rositas soils are formed in eolian deposits. In addition, Carsitas and Rositas soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 25 to 28 degrees C."

Elevations range from 200 to 800 meters (655 to 2,625 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."

Pintobasin soils do not have an argillic horizon. Patscamp soils have less than 50 centimeters of sand or loamy sand material above the argillic horizon and have a calcic horizon associated with the argillic horizon."
