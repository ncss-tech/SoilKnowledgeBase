  "OVERVIEW": "The Jaucas series consists of very deep, excessively drained, very rapidly permeable soils on vegetated beach areas along the sea coast.  They formed in calcareous sand deposits.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 80 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.",

Cinnamon Bay soils are on higher positions and have fine-loamy subsoils.  Glynn soils are on higher positions and have clayey-skeletal particle-size control sections.  Sandy Point soils and Sugar Beach soils are in slightly lower saline marshes, flats and ponds and are very poorly drained.  In addition, Sandy Point soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections and Sugar Beach soils are organic.  Solitude soils are in areas adjacent to saline marshes, flats, and ponds, have loamy subsoils and are somewhat poorly drained."
