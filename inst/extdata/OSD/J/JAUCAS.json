Cinnamon Bay soils are on higher positions and have fine-loamy subsoils.  Glynn soils are on higher positions and have clayey-skeletal particle-size control sections.  Sandy Point soils and Sugar Beach soils are in slightly lower saline marshes, flats and ponds and are very poorly drained.  In addition, Sandy Point soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections and Sugar Beach soils are organic.  Solitude soils are in areas adjacent to saline marshes, flats, and ponds, have loamy subsoils and are somewhat poorly drained."
