    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jonesboro soils are on ridgetops and shoulders of the loess-capped till plains of Illinoian age. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. The soils formed in 46 to 102 cm (18 to 40 inches) of loess and the underlying till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1170 mm (37 to 46 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 9 to 14 degrees C (48 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 155 to 225 days. Elevation is 271 to 311 meters (890 to 1020 feet) above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Loudon, Nicely, Rossmoyne, Schaffer, Secondcreek, and Westboro soils. Loudon soils are fine textured and are on adjacent side slopes. Nicely soils have more sand in the upper part of the solum and are on shoulders and backslopes. Rossmoyne soils have a fragipan and are on similar positions. The somewhat poorly drained Schaffer and Westboro soils are in drainageways and swales. The very poorly drained Secondcreek soils are in depressions."

The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 46 to 91 cm (1.5 to 3.0 feet) between January and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to high depending on slope gradient. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper solum and moderately low in the lower solum. Permeability is moderate in the upper solum and slow in the lower solum."
