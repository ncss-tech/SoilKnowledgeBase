    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jollymill soils are on ridge tops and side slopes. Slopes are convex and range from 1 to 60 percent. These soils formed in cherty or silty colluvium and the underlying hillslope sediments and residuum from cherty limestone in upper Mississippian geology. Bedrock is dominantly Grand Falls Chert or other hard chert layers, but can be Tripoli, and is dominantly 2 to 6 feet thick. The mean annual temperature varies from 56 to 59 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation varies from 38 to 48 inches."

Crackerneck soils are on ridge tops and high stream terraces. Hailey soils are on shoulder slopes and side slopes. Clarksville and Noark soils are on ridge tops.  Goss and Rueter soils are on side slopes."
