  "OVERVIEW": "The Jollymill series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils on uplands.  They formed in colluvium and the underlying hillslope sediments and residuum from cherty limestone on ridges in MLRAs 116A and 116B.  Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches.",

Bedrock is dominantly Grand Falls Chert or other hard chert layers, but can be Tripoli, and is dominantly 2 to 6 feet thick. The mean annual temperature varies from 56 to 59 degrees F.
