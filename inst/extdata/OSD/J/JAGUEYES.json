The soil ranges from strongly to extremely acid.\nThe A horizons have hues of 2.5Y or 10YR, values of 4 or 5, chromas of 2 through 6.  The Ap horizon is sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizons have dominant hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 4 through 8 and chromas of 4 through 8.  Mottles are common or many are red or dark red in color.  Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  The structure ranges from weak to moderate subangular block.  Clay films range from few faint to many prominent.\nThe C horizons have dominant red colors.  They are sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam."

The Albonito, Cialitos, Daguey, and Limones soils have a higher content of organic matter in the argillic horizon.  The Alonso and Ingenio soils have finer textured argillic horizons with more than 35 percent clay.  The Consumo, Corozal, Lirios, Maricao, Moca, and Rio Piedras soils have higher cation exchange capacity--more than 24 meq/100 grams of clay - in their argillic horizons.  The Magens soils are dry for more than 60 consecutive days during most years.  The Sabana Seca soils are saturated with water during some part of the year and have dominant low chroma colors."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Jagueyes soils occur in sloping to steep sideslopes and narrow ridgetops.  Slope gradients range from 20 to 40 percent.  The soil formed in highly weathered residuum of plutonic igneous rocks, mainly quartz diorite and granodiorite.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual rainfall is from 75 to 85 inches and the mean annual temperature is from 77 to 80 degrees F."
