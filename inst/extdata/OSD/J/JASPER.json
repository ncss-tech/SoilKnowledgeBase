  "OVERVIEW": "The Jasper series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy material and stratified loamy sediments on outwash plains. Some pedons have a thin mantle of loess or other silty material. Slopes range from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches).",

A till substratum phase is currently recognized. These soils will be investigated during MLRA update activities to determine if new series is needed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 48 cm (19 inches) (Ap and A horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from about 48 to 124 cm (19 to 49 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons); udic moisture regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
