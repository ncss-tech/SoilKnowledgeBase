A till substratum phase is currently recognized. These soils will be investigated during MLRA update activities to determine if new series is needed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 48 cm (19 inches) (Ap and A horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from about 48 to 124 cm (19 to 49 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons); udic moisture regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
