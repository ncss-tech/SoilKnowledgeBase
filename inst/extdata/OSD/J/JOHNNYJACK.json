  "OVERVIEW": "The Johnnyjack series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary sources. Johnnyjack soils are on stream terraces in mountain river valleys. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 2030 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C.",
