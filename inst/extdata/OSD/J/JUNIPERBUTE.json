  "OVERVIEW": "The Juniperbute series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils on basalt plains.  They formed in eolian deposits from mixed sources.  Permeability is very rapid.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Lowercreek soils have an O horizon and lack mollic colors below the A horizon.  Pablo soils lack mollic colors below the A horizon and have an O horizon.  Sacheen soils have an O horizon, B horizons, and are moderately or slightly acid.  Shellrock soils formed in granitic parent materials and have loamy coarse sand textures in the texture control section.  Sisters soils have 20 to 60 percent volcanic ash and have 30 to 50 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Juniperbute soils are on nearly level to steep basalt plains and mountain sideslopes.  Elevations are 5,250 to 6,100 feet.  Slopes are 1 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in stabilized eolian deposits from mixed sources.  On steeper slopes there has been some influence from slope alluvium.  Average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches and comes mostly during winter and spring months.  Average annual temperature is 39 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 75 to 95 days."

These soils are on stabilized dunes and basalt plains.  The Blacknoll and Siddoway soils have A-B-C profiles, a mollic epipedon, and a calcic horizon.  Grassyridge and Malm soils have calcic horizons.  Snowshoe soils have A-B-C profiles and are effervescent in the lower horizons.  Wolverine soils have lime in the profile and are usually dry except for 60 to 80 days in early spring."
