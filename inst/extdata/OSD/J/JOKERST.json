  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to lithic bedrock is 4 to 10 inches, (5 to 25 cm).  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F, (15 to 18 degrees C).  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about May to about October (about 150 to 200 days).  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 24 percent clay and 10 to 35 percent rock fragments, mostly gravel.  Mineralogy is mixed.  A fluctuating water table can occur between the top of the bedrock and the surface of the soil from November through March.  Redoximorphic features such as iron-manganese masses occur in the A and Bt horizons, iron-manganese concretions in the Bt horizon, and manganese masses occur in layers 1/16 to 1/8 inch, (2 to 4 mm) thick on top of the bedrock.  Rock fragments on the surface range from 0 to 10 percent gravel, 2 to 30 percent cobbles, 3 to 50 percent stones and 0 to 5 percent boulders.  Some pedons have a 1/16 inch, (2 mm) thick organic mat on the surface.\nThe A horizon dry color is 5YR 4/6, 5/6 or 7.5YR 6/6.  Moist color is 2.5YR 3/3, 3/4, 5YR 3/2, 3/4, 4/3, 7.5YR 3/2 or 3/3.  Texture is loam, gravelly loam, cobbly loam, stony loam, very cobbly loam or very stony loam.  Clay content ranges from 12 to 21 percent.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 25 percent gravel, 10 to 40 percent cobbles and 0 to 30 percent stones.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon dry color is 5YR 5/6, 6/6 or 7.5YR 6/6.  Moist color is 2.5YR 3/3, 3/4, 5YR 4/3, 4/4, 7.5YR 3/3 or 3/4.  Texture is loam, gravelly loam or cobbly loam.  Clay content ranges from 16 to 25 percent.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent stones.
