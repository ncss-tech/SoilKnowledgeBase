  "OVERVIEW": "The Jehemy series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in alluvium material derived mostly from sedimentary rock sources.  Jehemy soils are on marine terraces and hills and have slopes of 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 millimeters (11 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to bedrock is greater than 150 centimeters.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 17 degrees C (62.6 degrees F.), and the difference between the mean summer and the mean winter is about 5 degrees C (9 degrees F).  The soil between the depths of 15 and 26 centimeters (6 and 14 inches) is dry in all parts from about May or June to November and is moist in all parts of the soil moisture control section from January to mid-March 60 to 75 days.  The soil temperature is always above 8 degrees C (47 degrees F).  The moisture regime is ustic bordering on aridic.  When dry, the soil develops cracks that are at least 1 cm wide and 15 to 36 centimeters (6 to 12 inches) apart at a depth of 71 centimeters (28 inches).  The cracks remain open from sometime in June or July until sometime in October.  The soil is neutral or moderately alkaline. Some pedons have finely disseminated calcium carbonate or calcium carbonate is segregated as few fine seams, filaments or threads.  ESP ranges from 15 to 35 to a depth of 112 centimeters (44 inches) and the electrical conductivity is 4 to 8 desisiemens per meter.\nThe An horizon has dry colors of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3; 2.5Y 5/2 or 6/2, and moist colors of 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3; 2.5Y 3/2, or 4/2.  It has 40 to 60 percent clay.  It has few wedge shape aggregates and few intersecting slickensides in the lower part of the A horizon.\nThe Cn horizon has dry colors of 10YR 6/2, 6/3; 2.5Y 6/2 or 6/4, and moist colors of 10YR 4/2, 4/3; 2.5Y 4/2 or 4/3.  Some pedons have few faint mottles and iron stains, 10YR 7/4, 6/6, or 7/6; moist color is 10YR 5/4, 4/6, or 5/6.  Texture is clay and clay loam.  ESP is 5 to 20.\nChanneled and overwashed phases are also recognized, overwashed phases are loams or sandy loams about 20 to 36 centimeters (8 to 14 inches) thick.  The overwash soil material is the result of accelerated past erosion from the steeper slopes."
