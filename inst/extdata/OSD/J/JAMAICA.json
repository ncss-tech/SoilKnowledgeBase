  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is 25 to 50 cm. The thickness of the sandy dredge materials range from 100 to 200 cm. Soil texture ranges from fine sand to coarser. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral. Coarse fragments are generally absent. Some pedons contain shell fragments.\nThe ^A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is defined by moderate fine granular structure. Consistence is very friable.\nThe ^C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3. Structure is massive or single grain. Consistence is very friable. Some pedons have common horizontal bands 1 cm thick, with a high proportion of dark minerals."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jamaica soils are on nearly level areas to gently sloping artificially-created or human-altered landforms. These soils formed in sandy dredge spoils from dredging activities along coastal waterways and rivers, in and near major urbanized areas of the Northeast. The dredge material contains few, if any, human artifacts. Coarse fragments are less than 20 percent. Shell fragments may be present. Slope ranges are commonly 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual temperature range 8 to 17 degrees C and mean annual precipitation ranges from 1020 to 1325 mm."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Barren, Bigapple, Breeze, Fortress, Hooksan, Ipswich, Matunuck, Pawcatuck, Sandyhook and Verrazano soils. The excessively to well drain Bigapple, moderately well drained Fortress, and somewhat poorly drained Barren soils are associated in a drainage sequence.  Breeze soils average more than 10 percent (by volume) human artifacts throughout. Hooksan soils formed in sandy eolian deposits. Ipswich, Matunuck and Pawcatuck soils formed in organic soil materials and are subject to tidal flooding. Sandyhook soils formed in sandy marine deposits and are subject to tidal flooding. Verrazano soils have a contrasting particle size class within 100 cm of the soil surface."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of these soils are used for wildlife habitat and recreation. Urban development is unlikely due to high water tables and ponding. Native vegetation consists of poison ivy, bayberry, Multiflora rose, ferns, Phragmites, bitter sweet, mugwort, and dogwood."
