  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jonnic soils are on fan piedmont remnants.  The soils formed in alluvium from mostly quartzite sources with some shale and limestone.  Slopes are 4 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 3,000 to 4,500 feet. The climate is arid with hot dry summers and mild winters.  The mean annual precipitation is between 7 and 9 inches; mean annual temperature is between 57 to 64 degrees F., and the frost-free season is about 180 to 220 days."

In 1985 the subgroup was changed from Abruptic to Xerollic based on collected data, in addition, mineralogy was changed from mixed to montmorillonitic.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from about 2 to 38 inches (Bt, Btk1 and Btk2 horizons).\nXeric intergrade - Soil moisture regime is Xeric Aridic\nDuripan - The zone from about 38 to 45 inches (Bqkm horizon).\nTextural control section - The zone from about 2 to 22 inches. (Bt, Btk1 and part of the Btk2 horizons)\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 9/2015. The last revision to the series was 8/2001.
