  "OVERVIEW": "The Jonnic series consists of moderately deep over a duripan, well drained soils that are on fan piedmont remnants.  Jonnic soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  Slopes are 4 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

In 1985 the subgroup was changed from Abruptic to Xerollic based on collected data, in addition, mineralogy was changed from mixed to montmorillonitic.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from about 2 to 38 inches (Bt, Btk1 and Btk2 horizons).\nXeric intergrade - Soil moisture regime is Xeric Aridic\nDuripan - The zone from about 38 to 45 inches (Bqkm horizon).\nTextural control section - The zone from about 2 to 22 inches. (Bt, Btk1 and part of the Btk2 horizons)\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 9/2015. The last revision to the series was 8/2001.
