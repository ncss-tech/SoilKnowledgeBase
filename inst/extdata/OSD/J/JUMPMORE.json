    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Average annual soil temperature ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days during summer and fall.  The upper 10 to 22 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.15 to 1.30 g/cc volcanic glass content of 7 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.3 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar moisture of 5 to 10 percent (air-dry).  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 29 percent clay and 40 to 60 percent sand in the fine earth fraction.  Rock fragments average 40 to 75 percent by volume.  Base saturation (by NH4OAC) is estimated to range from 50 to 60 percent between depths of 10 and 30 inches below the soil surface.  Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, chroma of 3 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.  It is cobbly ashy loam, gravelly ashy loam, very cobbly ashy loam, or very gravelly ashy sandy loam.  It is 10 to 14 percent clay.\nThe 2Bw horizon has colors similar to the Bw horizon.  It is very gravelly loam, very cobbly loam or very gravelly sandy loam.  It is 10 to 14 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, chroma of 4 through 6 dry or moist.  It is very cobbly loam, very gravelly clay loam, extremely gravelly loam or extremely gravelly sandy clay loam.  It is 18 to 29 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jumpmore soils are on mountain sides and have slopes of 30 to 65 percent.  They formed in residuum and colluvium from Teanaway and Grande Ronde basalt, loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash.  Elevation is 2,400 to 5,500 feet.  These soils are in a climate with warm moderately dry summers and cool moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 35 to 50 inches.  The average January temperature is about 24 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 64 degrees F. The average annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F is 145 to 170 days and the frost-free season is about 65 to 100 days."

Cliffdell soils have a mantle of volcanic ash 7 to 10 inches thick and are on mountain sides and ridges.  Jummer soils are on mountain sides.  Jumpe soils have base saturation of 60 to 90 percent in the Bw horizon and are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice and are on convex mountain sides, ridges, and smooth summits.  Keechelus soils have a clayey-skeletal argillic horizon and are on mountain sides, ridges, and benches.    Kiper soils are coarse-loamy with 5 to 20 percent hard sandstone fragments in the control section and are on mountain sides.  Standup soils have an ashy mantle less than 7 inches thick, a particle-size control section with 10 to 15 percent clay, and are on mountain sides."
