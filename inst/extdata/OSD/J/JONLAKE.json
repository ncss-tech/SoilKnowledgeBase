  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jonlake soils are on mountains and typically occur on summit and backslope positions. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from quartzite with local admixtures of argillite. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. Elevations are 2,070 to 3,170 m. The climate is moist-subhumid, cold wet winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 700 mm, the mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 40 to 60 days."
