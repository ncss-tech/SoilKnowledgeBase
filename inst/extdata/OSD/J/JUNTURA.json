  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F. (estimated).  The soil is saturated with water at some period of the year.  The soil is noncalcareous and ranges in reaction from mildly to moderately alkaline.  Strongly contrasting textures are lacking within 40 inches of the surface and bedrock is deeper than 60 inches.  The 10 to 40-inch control section ranges from silt loam and loam to very fine sandy loam and has a weighted average of less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand including coarse fragments up to 7.5 cm.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, values of 2 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chromas of 1 and 2 moist and dry.  It has strong or moderate granular structure in the upper part and moderate granular or weak to moderate prismatic parting to weak or moderate subangular or angular blocky structure in the lower part.\nThe AC horizon has values of 3 moist and 5 dry and chromas of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Sand, gravelly sand or very gravelly medium or moderately coarse textured alluvium are below 40 inches in some places.  Depth to a water table ranges from 14 to 36 inches.  Faint mottles may occur in the A horizons.  Mottles are either distinct in the lower part of the mollic epipedon or are dark gray immediately below the epipedon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Juntura soils occur on nearly level flood plains at elevations of 2,800 to 4,000 feet.  These soils are formed in stratified medium textured alluvium of mixed origin.  The climate is semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of 10 to 12 inches.  The summers are dry.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F., the average January air temperature is 25 degrees F., the average July air temperature is 70 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
