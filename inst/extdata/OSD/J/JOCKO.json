  "OVERVIEW": "The Jocko series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in glacial outwash and alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces and dissected alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
