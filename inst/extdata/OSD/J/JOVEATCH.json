  "OVERVIEW": "The Joveatch series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvial sediments derived from mixed sources.  Joveatch soils are in depressions, basin floors and fan piedmont slopes with slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
