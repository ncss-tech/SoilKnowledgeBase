  "OVERVIEW": "The Jivas series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed volcanic rocks.  Jivas soils are on mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
