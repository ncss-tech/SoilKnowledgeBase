All these series except Cloverlick and Highsplint have a solum thickness less than 80 inches. Cloverlick soils average less than 40 percent sand in the particle-size control section. Highsplint soils average more than 35 percent silt in the lower part of the cambic horizon. Also, Cloverlick and Highsplint soils are not dominated by bouldery and stony fragments in the upper part of the solum."

They formed in colluvium from sandstone and siltstone bedrock. Slopes range from 20 to 50 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 11.1 to 13.9 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Frost-free days range from 170 to 200. Elevation ranges from 105.2 to 305 meters (345 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

The well drained Branchville soils are typically complexed with the Jubin soils and are on the lower part of the footslopes. The moderately well drained Deuchars, Ebal and Kitterman soils are on shoulders and backslopes of hills."
