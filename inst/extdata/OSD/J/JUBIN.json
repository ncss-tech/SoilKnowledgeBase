  "OVERVIEW": "The Jubin series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on benches of hills. They formed in colluvium from sandstone and siltstone bedrock. Slopes range from 20 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12.8 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
