Depth to the argillic horizon ranges from 12 to 18 inches.  Rock fragments are angular gravel, cobbles and stones of shale and sandstone.  Some pedons have a thin A1 horizon.\nThe A2 horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, very fine sandy loam, or light clay loam and has 20 to 50 percent rock fragments.\nThe B2t horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is clay loam, sandy clay or clay and has 35 to 50 percent clay and 50 to 80 percent rock fragments."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chris, Loberg, Nutras, Seitz and Vulcan series.  All of these soils except Loberg have montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Loberg soils have an A2 horizon less than 13 inches thick.  Also, they are slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part of the profile."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Jaroso soils are on moderately sloping smooth sides of mountains and strongly sloping to steep sides of rough mountains.  Elevations are 9,000 to 11,000 feet.  These soils formed in material weathered from interbedded shale and sandstone and some limestone.  The climate is humid and the annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 40 inches.  About 70 percent of the precipitation comes in the form of snow and in most years the snowpack is in place as late as mid-June.  About 30 percent of the precipitation comes as summer storms."
