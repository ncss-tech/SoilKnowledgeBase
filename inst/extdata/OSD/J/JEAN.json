  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in sandy alluvial or aeolian materials underlain by unconforming sandy-skeletal sediments from mixed rock sources.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations are 2,000 to 3,600 feet.  The climate is arid with hot dry summers and mild winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 7 inches; mean annual temperature is 62 to 68 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 240 to 300 days."
