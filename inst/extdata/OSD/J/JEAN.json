  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Jean series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in sandy alluvial or aeolian materials over unconforming sandy-skeletal sediments from mixed rock sources.  The Jean soils are on erosional fan remnants, inset fans, and channels.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F.",
