  "OVERVIEW": "The Jenrid series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  Jenrid soils are on alluvial flats.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
