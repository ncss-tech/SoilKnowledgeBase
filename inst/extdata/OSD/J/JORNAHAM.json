  "OVERVIEW": "The Jornaham series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium from gypsum rock and limestone. Jornaham soils are on ridges, fan terraces and knolls. Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",
