  "OVERVIEW": "The Jughandle series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum from granitic rock. Jughandle soils are on mountains and have slopes of 7 to 90 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 34 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

They formed in residuum from granite, quartz monzonite, gneiss or similar coarse-grained acid igneous bedrock. Elevations are 3,000 to 7,000 feet. Average annual precipitation is 25 to 45 inches. Average annual temperature is 36 degrees to 42 degrees F. Frost- free season is 10 to 70 days."

Molly soils have a high content of volcanic ash and loess in the upper part. Suttler soils have an umbric epipedon and lack a Bs horizon."

The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
