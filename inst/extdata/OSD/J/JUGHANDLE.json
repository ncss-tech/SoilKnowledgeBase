  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jughandle soils are on mountainous slopes, usually with a northerly aspect, and have gradients of 7 to 90 percent. They formed in residuum from granite, quartz monzonite, gneiss or similar coarse-grained acid igneous bedrock. Elevations are 3,000 to 7,000 feet. Average annual precipitation is 25 to 45 inches. Average annual temperature is 36 degrees to 42 degrees F. Frost- free season is 10 to 70 days."

Helmer soil have a medium textured Bs horizon and a fragipan. Lochsa soils lack cryic summer soil temperature and have a thick umbric epipedon. Molly soils have a high content of volcanic ash and loess in the upper part. Suttler soils have an umbric epipedon and lack a Bs horizon."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This revision changes the classification from Coarse-loamy, mixed Vitrandic Cryochrepts to Coarse-loamy, isotic Vitrandic Eutrocryepts.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 4 to 15 inches (Bs horizon).\nCambic horizon - the zone from 15 to 45 inches (2Bw and 2BC horizons).\nParalithic contact - at 45 inches.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Coarse-loamy, isotic Vitrandic Eutrocryepts to Coarse-loamy, isotic Vitrandic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
