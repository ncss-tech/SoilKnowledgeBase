  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Jana series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium and residuum derived from conglomerate, sandstone and shale.  Jana soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 30 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
