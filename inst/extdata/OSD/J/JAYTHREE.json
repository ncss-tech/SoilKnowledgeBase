  "OVERVIEW": "The Jaythree series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from arkosic sandstone and shale.   Jaythree soils are in valleys and drainageways.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
