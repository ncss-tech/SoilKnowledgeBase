  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact of hard fractured bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 59 degrees F.; mean January soil temperature is 34 to 39 degrees F.; mean July soil temperature is 68 to 83 degrees F.  The soil temperature at the 20 inch depth or the lithic contact exceeds 41 degrees F. from April 15 to November 20.  The soil between the depths of 4 and 12 inches is dry from mid-June until mid-October and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the time.  Rock fragments make up 15 to 35 percent of the soil profile and consist mostly of fine and medium (2 to 15mm) gravel.\nThe A horizon is dark grayish brown, grayish brown, dark brown or brown (10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 4/2, 5/2).  Moist colors are very dark brown, very dark grayish brown or dark brown (10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3; 7.5YR 3/2).  It has 12 to 18 clay and is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon is dark brown. dark yellowish brown, brown, yellowish brown, pale brown, light yellowish brown, strong brown, or light brown (10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4).  Moist colors are dark brown, dark yellowish brown, brown, yellowish brown or strong brown (10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6).  The upper part of the B2t horizon has dry value of 4 or 5 and moist value and chroma of 3.  It is gravelly loam or gravelly clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and has at least a 4 percent (absolute) clay increase but lacks an abrupt A/B2t horizon boundary.  It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe bedrock is slightly to highly fractured and slightly weathered with soil materials filling some of the fractures."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in materials weathered from metamorphosed sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Elevations are 2,200 to 5,000 feet.  The climate is continental and subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 32 inches.  Seasonal snowfall is 18 to 24 inches.  Mean January temperature is 28 to 37 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 90 to 150 days."
