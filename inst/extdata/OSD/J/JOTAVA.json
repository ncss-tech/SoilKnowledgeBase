Elevations range from 1,375 to 1,680 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; medium surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 60 and 150 cm (moderately deep and deep free water occurrence classes) between January and May.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods year-round.  This flooding is slow, very shallow sheet flow following storms and heavy snow melt."
