These soils formed in alluvium derived from quartzite, limestone, and reworked lacustrine deposits. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations are 1,700 to 2,250 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, generally dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 350 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
