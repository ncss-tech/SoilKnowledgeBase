  "OVERVIEW": "The Jarab series consists of shallow to an indurated duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from quartzite, limestone and reworked lacustrine deposits. Jarab soils are on intermountain valley fans, alluvial fans and fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
