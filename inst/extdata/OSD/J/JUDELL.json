  "OVERVIEW": "The Judell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium and colluvium derived mainly from limestone.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
