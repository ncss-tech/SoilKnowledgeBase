    "content": "REMARKS:   Soil interpretive record: MT1751, MT3231.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from 2 to 6 inches (A horizons); a cambic horizon from 6 to 23 inches (Bw and BC1 horizons); a particle size control section from 10 to 40 inches (part of Bw, BC1 and BC2 horizons); a layer of decomposing welded tuff from 58 to 60 inches (Cr horizon).  Judco soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Vitrandic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustivitrandic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
