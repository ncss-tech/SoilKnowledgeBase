  "OVERVIEW": "The Jonda series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium weathered from tuff.  These soils are on mountains  and have slopes of 5 to 45 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
