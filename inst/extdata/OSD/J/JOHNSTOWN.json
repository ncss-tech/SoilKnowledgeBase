    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 44 inches.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 55 inches.  The depth to the 2C horizon typically ranges from 40 to 60 inches.\nDepth to carbonates ranges from 30 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to buried soils ranges from 14 to 36 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is typically loam but includes fine sandy loam, clay loam, or silt loam.  It is moderately acid through neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is typically clay loam but includes silty clay loam.  It averages between 27 and 35 percent clay.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Btb1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Btb2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam.  It averages between 27 and 35 percent clay.  It is neutral or silghtly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a BCkb horizon.\nThe BCb horizon and the C horizon, when present, have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  They are loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.  They are neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Goshen, Hall, Kuma, Mobridge, and Simpatico soils. Goshen, Hall, Kuma and Mobridge soils typically do not have coarse sand and gravel between a depth of 40 and 60 inches.  Goshen, Hall and Mobridge soils do not have buried horizons above 40 inches.  Simpatico soils are in an area with a drier climate and have redder hues in the argillic horizon."

Anselmo soils are coarse-loamy.  O'Neill soils are moderately deep over coarse sand and gravel.  They are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal. Brocksburg and Jansen soils occur on similar landscapes and are moderately deep over coarse sand and gravel.  They are in the fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal family."
