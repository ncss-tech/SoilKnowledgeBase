  "OVERVIEW": "The Jeffers series consists of deep, poorly drained calcareous soils that formed in loamy glacial till or drift on glacial moraines and till plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (46 degrees F). The mean annual precipitation is about 66 centimeters (26 inches).",

Rock fragments comprise 0 to l0 percent of the volume of the sola and 3 to 15 percent of the C horizon. The average calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 20 percent in the solum and C horizon. These soils commonly have a calcic horizon, but it begins below depths of 16 inches. Carbonates are disseminated in the upper part of the sola, and both disseminated and in 5 to 10 mm diameter soft masses in the lower part of the sola and in the C horizon. The average content of gypsum in the sola is 2 to 5 percent. It occurs throughout the sola in powder form as coats on faces of peds or as 1 to 5 mm diameter crystals and few 5 to 10 mm diameter nests of crystals, or both. The C horizon lacks or has a trace of gypsum.\nThe A horizon has 2.5Y hue, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1. It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe BG, Bkg, and Bk horizons have 2.5Y hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2 in the upper part and 1 through 4 in the lower part. It is commonly clay loam and less commonly loam. It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has 2.5Y hue or 5Y hue, value of 4 or 5, and chrome of 2 through 4. It is commonly loam and less commonly clay loam or sandy clay loam. It is slightly or moderately alkaline."

These soils formed in loamy calcareous glacial till or drift which mantles a firm calcareous glacial till at depths as shallow as 76 centimeters (30 inches) in a few pedons. These sediments are Late Wisconsin Age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 10 C (45 to 50 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 61 to 71 centimeters (24 to 28 inches). Annual frost free days are 125 to 170. Elevation ranges from 267 to 480 meters (890 to 1,600\nfeet) above mean sea level."

Poorly drained   Pell Creek soils are on broad flats, lack gypsum in the sola and are not calcareous in all parts. Poorly drained and very poorly Romnell soils are in  slightly concave, flat, and depressional areas and are not calcareous in all parts Walnut Grove soils are in similar position but are leached in the upper third of the profile."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and properties recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 43 centimeters (18 inches) (Ap, A and AB horizons), cambic horizon - the zone from 43 to 89 centimeters (18 to 35 inches) (BA and Bkg and Bk horizons), Aquic moisture regime.\nThese soils formerly were included in the mapping units of the Canisteo soils among others. These soils are marginal to having a gypsic horizon.\nThe OSD was moved to this location as of this revision to better fit the concept of firm till. 1/21/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected."
