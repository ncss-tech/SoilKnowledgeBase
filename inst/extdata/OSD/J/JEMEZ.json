  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Elevations are 7,500 to 8,800 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 to 24 inches. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F., and the frost-free period is about 60 to 130 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: In October 2000, taxonomic classification was converted to the closest match found in Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition 1999.  Previous classification was fine-loamy, mixed Mollic Eutroboralfs. Some update was made to horizon nomenclature, competing series section, etc.  Other placements may be more appropriate after a complete update.\nResponsibility transferred to the Lakewood MO 5/2001.\nThis pedon may have sufficient volcanic glass for the Vitrandic subgroup; future investigation will need to determine this. At this time it is presumed to have a significant component of volcanic glass, so an estimate was added to the Range in Characteristics. This may help to provide separation from competitors until this question is resolved.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 13 inches.  (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizons:  The zone from 19 to 27 inches.  (Bt horizons)\nLithic contact:  Tuff at 27 inches. (2R layer)\nParticle-size control section - from 19 to 27 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
