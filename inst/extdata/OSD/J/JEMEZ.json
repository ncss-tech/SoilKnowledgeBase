  "OVERVIEW": "The Jemez series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from tuff and latite on hills and on interfluves on plateaus.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: In October 2000, taxonomic classification was converted to the closest match found in Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition 1999.  Previous classification was fine-loamy, mixed Mollic Eutroboralfs. Some update was made to horizon nomenclature, competing series section, etc.  Other placements may be more appropriate after a complete update.\nResponsibility transferred to the Lakewood MO 5/2001.\nThis pedon may have sufficient volcanic glass for the Vitrandic subgroup; future investigation will need to determine this. At this time it is presumed to have a significant component of volcanic glass, so an estimate was added to the Range in Characteristics. This may help to provide separation from competitors until this question is resolved.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 13 inches.  (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizons:  The zone from 19 to 27 inches.  (Bt horizons)\nLithic contact:  Tuff at 27 inches. (2R layer)\nParticle-size control section - from 19 to 27 inches."
