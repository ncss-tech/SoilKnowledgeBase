The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from early June to mid November (ranges 140 to 160) and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.    Rock fragments, on the soil surface, range from 0 to 90 percent.  The mollic epipedon is 8 to 14 inches thick and includes the upper part of the Bt horizon or all the Bt in soils less than 14 inches thick.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, or 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 5/2, 5/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, or 7.5YR 3/2, or 5YR 3/2, 3/3.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 2 percent.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, very cobbly loam, extremely stony loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, or very gravelly loam.  Clay content ranges from 10 to 27 percent.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.  Base saturation by ammonium acetate ranges from 85 to 100 percent.\nThe Bt horizon color is 10YR 4/3, 5/3, 5/4, or 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 5/6, or 5YR 4/2, 4/4.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon- 0 to 11 inches (A1,A2, Bt).\n2. Clay content in the control section is always over 35 percent.\nDuripan - 11 to 16 inches (Bqm).\nArgillic horizon - 6 to 11 inches (Bt)\nLithic contact - 16 inches (2R)\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Reference samples were run by the Susanville District-BLM on the A1 and Bt horizons for clay mineralogy.  The A1 horizon has a medium amount of montmorillonitic and kaolinitic clays and a small amount of vermiculite.  The Bt horizon is dominantly montmorillonitic with a small amount of kaolinitic clays.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
