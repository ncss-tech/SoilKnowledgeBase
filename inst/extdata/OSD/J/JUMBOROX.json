  "OVERVIEW": "The Jumborox series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite, granitoid or gneissic rocks. The Jumborox soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is  138 millimeters (5.5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",

Dovecanyon, Goldpeak, and Wingap soils are not moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September. Dovecanyon, Friedliver, Helendale, Hexie and Searchlight soils all have a mean annual soil temperatures of 19 to 22 degrees C. Dovecanyon soils also have no secondary carbonates. Friedliver soils also have an argillic with an upper boundary between 25 and 50 centimeters from the mineral soil surface. Goldivide soils have an argillic horizon 50 to 100 centimeters below the mineral soil surface.  Goldpeak soils are noneffervescent throughout. Hexie and Littlefargo soils are moderately deep and have a paralithic contact between 50 and 100 centimeters. Searchlight soils are moderately to strongly alkaline throughout the control section, and have 5 percent or more calcium carbonate equivalent throughout the series size control section.  Sonoita soils are intermittently moist for more than 20 days following summer convection storms.  The Tray soils are moderately well drained and have strongly or very strongly alkaline horizons that have an ESP of 15 to 30 within the particle size control section. Wingap soils have a paralithic contact within 100 to 150 centimeters of the soil surface and lack secondary carbonates."
