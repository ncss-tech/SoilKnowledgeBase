Dovecanyon, Goldpeak, and Wingap soils are not moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September. Dovecanyon, Friedliver, Helendale, Hexie and Searchlight soils all have a mean annual soil temperatures of 19 to 22 degrees C. Dovecanyon soils also have no secondary carbonates. Friedliver soils also have an argillic with an upper boundary between 25 and 50 centimeters from the mineral soil surface. Goldivide soils have an argillic horizon 50 to 100 centimeters below the mineral soil surface.  Goldpeak soils are noneffervescent throughout. Hexie and Littlefargo soils are moderately deep and have a paralithic contact between 50 and 100 centimeters. Searchlight soils are moderately to strongly alkaline throughout the control section, and have 5 percent or more calcium carbonate equivalent throughout the series size control section.  Sonoita soils are intermittently moist for more than 20 days following summer convection storms.  The Tray soils are moderately well drained and have strongly or very strongly alkaline horizons that have an ESP of 15 to 30 within the particle size control section. Wingap soils have a paralithic contact within 100 to 150 centimeters of the soil surface and lack secondary carbonates."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Jumborox soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived from granite, granitoid or gneissic rocks. Elevation is 1000 to 1575 meters (3,280 to 5,200 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 175 millimeters (4 to 7 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 13 to 17 degrees C. The frost free season is 210 to 270 days."

Desertqueen soils are very shallow and shallow to a paralithic contact and are found in areas where fan aprons cover pediment surfaces. Morongo soils are on fan aprons, are very deep and sandy throughout the particle-size control section.  Ironped soils are on fan aprons over pediments, and nearby hills and mountains. They are very shallow and shallow to a paralithic contact, do not have an argillic horizon and are sandy throughout."
