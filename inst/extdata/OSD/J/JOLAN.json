  "OVERVIEW": "The Jolan series consists of moderately deep to an indurated hardpan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed volcanic rocks.  The Jolan soils are on summits of alluvial fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
