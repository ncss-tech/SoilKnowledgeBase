  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jennett soils are on drainageways and depressions on plateaus.  These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from basalt and tuff.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Elevations range from 4,700 to 4,900 feet.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 19 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F., mean January temperature is 25 to 28 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

Casebeer and Norcross are clayey, shallow to duripans over bedrock, and have argillic horizons.  Dranket soils are fine, moderately deep to duripans over bedrock, do not have aquic conditions, and have argillic horizons."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; medium surface runoff; slow permeability.  Endosaturation is present with a seasonal high water table between 10 and 20 inches (shallow internal free water occurrence class) from December to May.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  During summer months in normal years a zone of saturation is not present.  These soils receive run-on moisture.  Soils on less than 1 percent slope on depressions are frequently ponded for long duration, mainly in the late winter and spring.  Soils with 1 percent slope on drainageways have brief or very brief periods of flooding, especially after intense rainfall events."
