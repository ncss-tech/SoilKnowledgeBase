  "OVERVIEW": "The Jennett series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from basalt and tuff.  Jennett soils are on drainageways and depressions on plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Endosaturation is present with a seasonal high water table between 10 and 20 inches (shallow internal free water occurrence class) from December to May.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  During summer months in normal years a zone of saturation is not present.  These soils receive run-on moisture.  Soils on less than 1 percent slope on depressions are frequently ponded for long duration, mainly in the late winter and spring.  Soils with 1 percent slope on drainageways have brief or very brief periods of flooding, especially after intense rainfall events."
