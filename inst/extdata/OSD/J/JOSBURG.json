  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 36 to 53 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches thick and may extend into the Bw horizon in some pedons.  Depth to the 2Bw horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Carbonates typically are below a depth of 30 inches and many pedons lack free carbonates to a depth of 60 inches.  Dark colored soil material and roots are common in cracks and cleavages in the 2Bw and 2BC horizons.  Fine pebbles commonly are on the surface and mixed throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is dominantly loam, but the range includes loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, and silt loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe BA horizon has value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is typically loam or clay loam, but fine sandy loam is within the series range. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is typically loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.  Clay content in the Bw horizon averages from 17 to 28 percent.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is sandy clay, sandy clay loam, clay loam or loam.  The percent clay in the 2Bw horizon ranges from 24 to 40 percent.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam or loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 and 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Redoximorphic concentrations in the soil matrix are faint to prominent brownish, yellowish or reddish, and common or many.  Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  In some places the carbonates occur as small soft, powdery accumulations in a noncalcareous soil matrix."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES::  These are the Clarno and Hand series (it is assumed Clarno series are competing pending an update in the classification).  Clarno and Hand soils have lime within 26 inches of the surface.  In addition, Clarno soils are formed in glacial till and Hand soils are formed in stratified loamy glacial meltwater sediments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Josburg soils are on uplands.  They are on convex and concave positions in the landscape.  Slope gradients are typically less than 2 percent but range from 0 to 9 percent.  Josburg soils formed in loamy material deposited over firm alluvial sediments.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 24 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Anselmo, Dunn, Jansen and O'Neill soils.  Anselmo soils are coarse-loamy and slightly higher in the landscape.  Dunn soils contain more sand in the upper part and are on similar positions.  In addition, Dunn soils have a perched seasonal high water table that ranges from about 1.5 to 3 feet during extended wet periods.  Jansen and O'Neill soils are underlain with gravelly coarse sand within a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  In addition, O'Neill soils are coarse-loamy.  O'Neill and Jansen soils are similar landscapes."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and slow in the lower part of the solum.  Runoff is low.  These soils have a slowly permeable layer within 1 meter that keeps the soil wet close enough to the surface for long enough periods that planting or harvesting operations may be adversely affected on some low areas during prolonged wet periods."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the acreage is cultivated.  Some areas are irrigated.  Alfalfa, wheat and corn are the principal crops.  A few areas are in native grass.  Big and little bluestem, sideoats grama and blue grama are the dominant species."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon--the zone from 0 to 13 inches (Ap and A horizon).\nThe 2Bw2 horizon has strong angular blocky structure and an increase in clay (see lab data indicated below), but the clay increase is due to deposition rather than illuviation.  However, it may be an argillic horizon if clay films are present.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab sample numbers of the Type Location are 79PO336-79PO341.  Pedon sample number is S78NE089-006(1-8).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
