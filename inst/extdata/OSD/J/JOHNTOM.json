  "OVERVIEW": "The Johntom series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from rhyodacite and quartz latite, with a component of loess and volcanic ash. These soils are on mountain ridges, shoulders, and upper backslopes. Slopes are 8 to 90 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Depth to a lithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches. The particle-size control section is 5 to 15 percent clay, 45 to 70 percent rock fragments by weighted average and has an estimated volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.10 to 0.25 percent and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples. Reaction is neutral or slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is 15 to 35 percent gravel, 5 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent stones.\nThe AC horizon is very gravelly ashy loam or extremely gravelly loam and is 30 to 60 percent gravel, 5 to 20 percent cobbles.\nThe C horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is very gravelly sandy loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, or extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam. It is 40 to 70 percent gravel and 5 to 20 percent cobbles."

Aldax soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for more than 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice and have a mollic epipedon that extends to the lithic contact. Bakeoven and Couleedam soils have an aridic moisture regime. Bakeoven, Bodacious, Bodell, Lickskillet, and Venator soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. In addition, Lickskillet soils have an aridic moisture regime. Hendap soils are calcareous throughout. Limekiln soils have a calcic horizon. Plaskett soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 55 to 58 degrees F. Rockly soils are 4 to 10 inches deep to a lithic contact."

Elevations range from 1,500 to 4,800 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 24 inches. The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 69 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is 40 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 140 days."

Inkler, Louiecreek, Republic, and Scoap soils are greater than 60 inches to bedrock. In addition, Inkler, Republic, and Scoap soils are frigid. Inkler soils are on foothills and mountains. Republic soils are on alluvial fans, terraces and footslopes and backslopes of mountains. Scoap soils are on uplands and mountainsides. Northstar and Thout are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock and are on glaciated mountainsides and ridgetops. Donavan soils are moderately deep to densic material Louiecreek and Northstar soils are on on toeslopes, footslopes, and backslopes of mountains."
