  "OVERVIEW": "The Jay series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy material overlying siltstone or cherty limestone.  These nearly level to gently sloping soil are on uplands on the Ozark Highlands; MLRA 116B.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 46 inches.",
