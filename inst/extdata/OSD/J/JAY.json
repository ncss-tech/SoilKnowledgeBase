Slope gradients range from 1 to 8 percent.  The soil formed in loamy residuum.  The underlying bedrock is siltstone or cherty limestone.  Average annual temperature at the type location is about 57 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 44 inches."

The Choteau and Dennis soils, which are on similar upland slopes, are in a fine particle size class and do not have fragipans.  The Taloka soils, which are on adjacent slightly depressional slopes, are in a fine particle size class and do not have a fragipan."
