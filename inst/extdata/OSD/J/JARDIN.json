  "OVERVIEW": "The Jardin series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed from eolian sands mixed with calcareous, loamy residuum of the Goliad Formation. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (72 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 584 mm (23 in).",

Major forbs include orange zexmenia, bushsunflower, velvet bundleflower and Oenothera spp. Dominant woody plants are guajillo, spiny hackberry, blackbrush, leatherstem, and Texas kidneywood. Woody species increase during extended periods of overgrazing. The ecological site is Shallow Sandy Loam, PE 19-31 (R083CY487TX)."
