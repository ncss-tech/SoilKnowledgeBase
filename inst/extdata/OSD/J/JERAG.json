  "OVERVIEW": "The Jerag series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium modified by eolian sands. Permeability is moderately slow above and below the very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon.  These soils are on fan piedmonts and fan remnants.  Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
