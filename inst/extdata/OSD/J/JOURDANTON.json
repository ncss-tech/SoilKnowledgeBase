Acuff, Motley, and Olton\nsoils have mean soil temperatures less than 72 degrees F.  In addition, Acuff soils have calcic horizons.  Motley soils are\nmoist for longer periods, and Olton soils have over 35 percent\nclay in their control sections.  Amphion and Hanis soils have\nmollic epipedons over 20 inches thick and have more than 35\npercent clay in their control sections.  Brennan and Duval soils\nlack mollic epipedons and have thinner sola.  Caid soils are calcareous throughout and have calcic horizons.  Hargill soils are moist for longer periods and have more frost-free days."
