  "OVERVIEW": "The Jafa series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  Jafa soils are on alluvial terraces and fans and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 54 degrees to 59 degrees F.  The soil temperature exceeds 47 degrees F from March 15 to November 30 and exceeds 41 degrees F from February 15 to December 30.  The soil between the depths of 7 and 21 inches is dry in all parts from July 1 to October 15 and is moist in all parts from January 1 to April 30.  The particle-size control section (25 to 45 inches) averages from 25 to 35 percent clay and from 5 to 35 percent total rock fragments.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6, 6/4; 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4 or 6/3.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6; 10YR 3/3, 3/4 or 4/3.  Only the upper 7 inches have moist chromas of 3 or less.  It is loam, or gravelly loam with 18 to 25 percent clay.  Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 30 percent and consists of pebbles.  It is neutral to strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon is 5YR 5/6, 5/8, 6/4, 6/6, 7/6; 7.5YR 4/6, 5/6, 6/4 or 6/6.  Moist color is 5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/6, 5/8; 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6 or 5/6.  Chroma is more than 4 in at least the lower part.  It is heavy loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam or their gravelly equivalents.  Clay content increases with depth or decreases only slightly from its maximum throughout the upper 60 inches of the profile.  Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent and consists of 5 to 30 percent pebbles and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  It is slightly acid to strongly acid.  Base saturation (by sum of cations) ranges from 40 to 70 percent.\nSome pedons have a B3t or C horizon below 60 inches.  It is gravelly or very gravelly clay loam or sandy clay loam.  Rock fragment content ranges from 25 to 50 percent and consists fo 20 to 35 percent pebbles and 4 to 15 percent cobbles."
