  "OVERVIEW": "The Jo series consists of very shallow or shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from basalt. Jo soils are on lower positions of weathered lava fields formed from non-viscous lava flows. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
