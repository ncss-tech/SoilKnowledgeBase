  "OVERVIEW": "The Jerryslu series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, moderately well drained saline-alkali soils that rest abruptly on an indurated lime-silica cemented duripan.  Jerryslu soils are developed from granitic alluvium on basin rims and fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",

In the native state, this soil is used for livestock grazing.  Native vegetation consists of red brome, Arabian schimus, foxtail fescue, pepperweed, filaree, Allenrolfea, and Allscale."
