Upon full mechanical and chemical reclamation where the natric horizon is destroyed and the duripan is more than 50 percent removed, the Jerryslu soil is destroyed and the Atesh soils (coarse-loamy, mixed (calcareous) thermic Alfic Torriarents) are formed. In the native state, this soil is used for livestock grazing.  Native vegetation consists of red brome, Arabian schimus, foxtail fescue, pepperweed, filaree, Allenrolfea, and Allscale."
