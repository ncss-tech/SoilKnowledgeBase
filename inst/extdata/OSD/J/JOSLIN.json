These soils formed in 40 to 60 inches of loamy material and in reddish, clayey, hematite-rich lacustrine deposits.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent.  Winters are cold and summers are hot.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 48 to 54 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 29 to 37 inches."
