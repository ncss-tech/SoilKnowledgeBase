It is silt loam or loam.\nThe next part of the control section (2Bt or 2BC horizon) has hue of 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay averaging between 35 and 50 percent clay.\nThe lower part of the control section (3C horizon to a depth of 60 inches) is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, or clay loam.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils primarily are on the Mississippi River valley terraces and in a few tributary valleys.  They also are in the ancient Mississippi River valley in Rock Island and Whiteside Counties, Illinois, known locally as the Meredosia slough.  These soils formed in 40 to 60 inches of loamy material and in reddish, clayey, hematite-rich lacustrine deposits.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent.  Winters are cold and summers are hot.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 48 to 54 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 29 to 37 inches."

Coyne soils have sandier A and upper B horizons and less clay in the 2B horizon.  Trempealeau soils are underlain by sand between depths of 20 and 40 inches."
