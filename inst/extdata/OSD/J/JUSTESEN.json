Border and Pegram soils contain more than 35 percent rock fragments below the argillic horizon. Chesnimnus soils have an influence of volcanic ash in the upper part. McCarey soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Bess, Vicking and Victon soils are less than 24 inches deep to carbonates."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Justesen soils are on gently sloping to steep alluvial fans, fan terraces, toeslopes, and foothills at elevations of 4,600 to 7,000 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in medium textured alluvium from rhyolite, basalt, and sedimentary rocks. The average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rains.  The average annual temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 70 to 110 days."

Bancroft soils have less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand in the particle-size control section.  Carey Lake soils lack a calcic horizon.  Drage soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Goodington soils have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  McCarey soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  McCarey and Goodington soils are on basalt plains. Drage soils are on alluvial fans associated with metasedimentary parent material. Carey Lake and Bancroft soils are on the same landscape."
