  "OVERVIEW": "The Justesen series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from rhyolitic, basaltic, and sedimentary rocks. Justesen soils are on alluvial fans, fan terraces, foothills and basalt plains and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
