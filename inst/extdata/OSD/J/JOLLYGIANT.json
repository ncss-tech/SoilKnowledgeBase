Beaucoup, Blackoar, Ettrick, Leshara, Gorham, and Lummi soils have a difference between average winter and summer soil temperature of greater than 9 degrees C and have a mean January soil temperature less than 8 degrees C.  Bridgeson, Sauvie, and Wapato soils are dominated by amorphous clays inherited from volcanic ash.   Copperas soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Gorham soils have a discontinuity and average more than 40 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.  Fella and Sepo soils have carbonates within a depth of 40 inches. Leshara soils also have free carbonates at depths of 10 to 26 inches.  Sauvie soils are also slightly acid and subject to freshwater overflow during high tides.  Wapato soils are 35 to 50 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jollygiant soils are on low terraces, alluvial fans, and fan remnants on alluvial plains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. Elevation is 3 to 50 meters. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 890 to 2030 millimeters. The mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C. The mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C. The mean annual air temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C. Frost free season is about 275 to 330 days."

Dungan soils have redoximorphic features at greater than 100 centimeters, and occur on higher positions than Jollygiant.  Canalschool soils are on high flood-plain steps and lack a mollic epipedon.  Swainslough and Arlynda soils have redoximorphic features at 0 to 10 centimeters, and are on backswamps and depressions. Arlynda soils are also on meander scars and are in the fine-silty family. Swainslough soils are in the fine family."
