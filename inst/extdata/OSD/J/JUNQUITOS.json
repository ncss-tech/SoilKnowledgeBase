Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the A or Ap horizon (except where limed), from strongly acid to slightly acid in the Bt horizons, and from slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the C horizons.  Concretions range from few to many throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture ranges from silty clay loam to clay loam in the fine earth fraction.  Rock fragments range from 20 to 35 percent, by volume.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of red and yellow and below 20 inches, gray, range from few to many. Texture is clay loam or clay.

The poorly drained Fortuna soils are very deep, on lower adjacent flood plains, and have less clay in the control section.  The somewhat poorly drained Mabi soils are very deep and are on lower adjacent alluvial fans and terraces.  The well drained Naranjito soils are on higher positions, and have less clay in the control section.  Rio Arriba soils are very deep, and are on lower adjacent alluvial fans and terraces, and have less clay in the control section.  The well drained Sabana soils are shallow to bedrock, on higher positions and have less clay in the control section.  The well drained Via soils are very deep, are on lower adjacent stream terraces, and have fine-loamy control sections."
