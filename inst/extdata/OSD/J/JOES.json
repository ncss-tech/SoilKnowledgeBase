  "OVERVIEW": "The Joes series consists of very deep, well drained soils on fan terraces, hills and basalt plains.  They formed in loess and silty alluvium derived from loess.  Slopes are 1 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
