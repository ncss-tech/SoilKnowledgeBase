    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils average 5 to 15 percent sand and 22 to 27 percent clay in the particle size control section. The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 55 to 59 degrees F..\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4, 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3. An E horizon, if present, has value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral. Sand content is less than 10 percent.\nThe Bt and BC horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6 in, but can be 2 chroma below depths of 40 inches. Texture commonly is silt loam or silty clay loam, but can be loam in the lower part. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral in the upper part and very strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part.\nThe 2Bt, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is very gravelly silt loam.\nThe 2C horizon, where present, has colors similar to the Bt horizon, with texture of gravelly to extremely gravelly loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jemerson soils are on nearly level to gently sloping high floodplains or low terraces. They formed in alluvium or loess and alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent and most areas are weakly dissected, resulting in broad, gentle undulations. Mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 37 inches."

The flood plain soils do not have argillic horizons. Freeburg, Twomile and Okaw soils are somewhat poorly or poorly drained."
