  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches. The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 30 inches. The calcium-magnesium ratio is 1 or more. Depth to the Btk horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Total content of very fine sand through very coarse sand is less than 10 percent throughout the solum, and strongly cemented or harder concretions are less than 5 percent. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the A horizon, and neutral to moderately alkaline in the subsoil and underlying layers.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2; or hue of 2.5Y, value of 3, and chroma of 2; or it is neutral with value of 3. Texture is silt loam or silt.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, or it is neutral with value of 3. Redoximorphic features are in shades of olive, brown, or gray. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Btkg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1; or hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2; or hue of 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. Very weakly to moderately cemented calcium carbonate concretions, 2 to 75 millimeters in diameter, make up 3 to 25 percent of the horizon by volume. Calcium carbonate equivalency ranges up to 5 percent. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. The Btkg horizon is discontinuous in some pedons.\nThe B'tg horizon and the Btg3 horizon have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Peds coatings have chroma of 1 or 2, and redoximorphic features are in shades of olive, brown, or gray. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have a Btk and a Bt horizon that has similar hue, value and texture as the Btkg, B'tg or Btg3 horizon, but with chroma ranging from 3 to 6.\nThe BC or C horizon, where present, has the same color range as the lower Bt, B'tg or Btg3 horizon. Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or silty clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Andry series is in the same family. The Essen, Loreauville, Meaton, Morey, and Urich series are in closely related families. Andry soils have a histic epipedon and have moderate to high salinity in all mineral horizons. Essen, and Loreauville soils do not have a mollic epipedon. Meaton soils have siliceous minerology. Morey soils have a fine-loamy particle size control section.  Urich soils are more acid and do not have secondary carbonates in the solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on nearly level to depressional areas on uplands or terraces. Slopes are less than 1 percent. They formed in late Pleistocene age loess deposits or silty alluvium. Average annual temperature ranges from 60 to 70 degrees F., and average annual rainfall ranges from 55 to 65 inches. Frost free days range from 235 to 350. Elevation ranges from 5 to 80 feet."

In addition, Acy soils are on nearly level terraces at low elevations that have been influenced by Mississippi River alluvium. Coteau and Duson soils are on convex ridges and side slopes. Deerford and Patoutville soils are on convex ridges and side slopes at higher elevations. Essen soils are on convex ridges at lower elevations. Frost soils are on broad depressional areas and along drainageways."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Jeanerette soils are somewhat poorly drained. Runoff is slow and permeability is moderately slow. The soil is wet in the layers below 1 to 2.5 feet during the months of December through April in most years. Some areas are subject to rare flooding."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the soil is cleared and is used for pasture or for growing sugarcane, rice, soybeans, cotton, wheat, and grain sorgum, in rotation with crayfish production. Native vegetation is big bluestem, indiangrass, and switchgrass. Some areas are in woodland that is presumed to be recent encroachment on the grassland."
