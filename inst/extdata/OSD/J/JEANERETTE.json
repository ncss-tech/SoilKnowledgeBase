  "OVERVIEW": "The Jeanerette series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loess or silty alluvium. They are on broad, nearly level areas or slight depressions on late Pleistocene age terraces. Mean annual temperature is 67 degrees F. near the type location, and mean annual rainfall is about 60 inches. Slope is dominantly less than 0.5 percent but ranges up to 1 percent.",
