  "OVERVIEW": "The Juanita series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from andesite.  Juanita soils are on mesas or cuestas, and on hillslopes and scarp slopes on sides of mesas. Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 4.4 degrees C.",
