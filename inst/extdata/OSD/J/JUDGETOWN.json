  "OVERVIEW": "The Judgetown series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in weathered granitic residuum with thick volcanic ash mantles. They are on mountain slopes and ridges. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to 17 inches and high below this depth. Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent. The average precipitation is about 42 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
