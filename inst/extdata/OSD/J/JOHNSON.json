  "OVERVIEW": "The Johnson series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess over material weathered from granitic or metamorphic rocks. Johnson soils are on canyon breaks, structural benches, plateaus, mountains, and hills and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 600 mm and the average annual air temperature is about 7.2 degrees C.",
