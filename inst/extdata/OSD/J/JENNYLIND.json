These soils formed in residuum derived from acidic tuff mainly associated with the Valley Springs Formation. Elevation is 60 to 650 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 915 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 15 to 17 degrees C. The frost free season is 235 to 340 days."
