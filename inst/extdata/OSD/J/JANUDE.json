  "STATES": "NE,SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Janude series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate.  These soils are on flood plains of major streams and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation is about 740 millimeters.",
