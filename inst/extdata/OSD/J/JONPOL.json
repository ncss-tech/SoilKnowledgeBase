Depth to the calcareous material ranges from 10 to 19 inches.  Coarse fragments are typically less than 5 percent but range from 0 to 15 percent pebbles throughout.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F.\nThe A horizon when present has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3 dry and moist.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3 dry and moist.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3 dry and moist.  Texture is heavy clay loam, silty clay or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.
