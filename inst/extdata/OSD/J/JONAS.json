Depth to unweathered bedrock ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Rock fragments in the particle-size control section range from 15 to 35 percent.  The soil is strongly acid or moderately acid throughout.  The soil moisture control section is usually moist but is dry for 30 to 45 consecutive days after the summer solstice; udic moisture regime.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Pebbles range from 10 to 30 percent in the upper part and 25 to 30 percent andesite pebbles and 10 to 30 percent andesite cobbles in the lower part.  Structure is weak or moderate.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 3 through 6 dry.  The horizon averages 15 to 35 percent rock fragments, including 5 to 15 percent andesite pebbles and 5 to 30 percent andesite cobbles.  It is gravelly loam, gravelly clay loam, cobbly loam, cobbly clay loam, gravelly silty clay loam, cobbly silty clay loam or very gravelly loam.  Some pedons have thin patchy clay films on some faces of peds and on some rock fragments."

Moe soils are less than 15 percent hard rock fragments and 35 to 45 percent apparent clay in the Bw horizon.  Murnen soils have an apparent silt loam texture and have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Vailton soils have soft siltstone fragments and no hard rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Wilhoit soils have an umbric epipedon 20 to 30 inches thick.  Xeno soils are 15 to 55 weathered breccia and lack lithic rock fragments in the particle-size control section."

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from andesite with an admixture of volcanic ash and pumice in the upper part.  Average annual precipitation is 60 to 90 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 61 degrees F, mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 140 to 190 days."
