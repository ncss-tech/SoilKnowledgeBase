  "OVERVIEW": "The Jonas series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from andesite and breccia with an admixture of volcanic ash in the upper part.  Jonas soils are on upland benches, hillsides, broad ridgetops, and mountain slopes at elevations of 1,800 to 2,800 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 90 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 75 inches and average annual temperature is about 43 degree F.",

Pebbles range from 10 to 30 percent in the upper part and 25 to 30 percent andesite pebbles and 10 to 30 percent andesite cobbles in the lower part.  Structure is weak or moderate.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 3 through 6 dry.  The horizon averages 15 to 35 percent rock fragments, including 5 to 15 percent andesite pebbles and 5 to 30 percent andesite cobbles.  It is gravelly loam, gravelly clay loam, cobbly loam, cobbly clay loam, gravelly silty clay loam, cobbly silty clay loam or very gravelly loam.
