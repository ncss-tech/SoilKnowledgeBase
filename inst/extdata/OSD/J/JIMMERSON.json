    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section (8 to 21 inches) is moist in all parts from about early December until early April and usually is dry in all parts from early July until early November (120 to 130 days).  The soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. from about early March to late December and is above 47 degrees F. from mid April to mid November.  The clay in the control section ranges from 18 to 30 percent.\nThe A horizon color is 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6; 5YR 5/4, 4/6, or 4/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/4; 5YR 3/4.  Horizons with mollic colors are too thin to qualify for a mollic epipedon.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 50 to 60 percent and ranges from 50 to 55 percent by sum of cations.  It is loam or stony sandy loam.  Rock fragments, mostly stones and gravel, range from 0 to 30 percent.  It ranges from moderately acid through neutral.  The percent clay ranges from 12 to 20 percent with a small amount of halloysite clay.  NaF pH ranges from 9.6 to 10.0. Glass content ranges from 10 to 15 percent.  Aluminum plus 1/2 iron (ammonium oxalate) range from 1 to 1.5.  Bulk density range from 1.0 to 1.5 g/cm3.\nThe Bt horizon color is 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 4/6, 5/6, 5/8, 6/6, 6/8; 5YR 4/4, 4/6 or 5/6 dry and is 10YR 4/6; 7.5YR 3/4, 5/4, 4/4, 4/6; 5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6; 2.5YR 3/4, 4/6, or 3/6 moist. Chroma of 6 to 8 occur in at least the lower part of the Bt horizon.  It is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, cobbly loam or cobbly clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay in the upper part with an average of 18 to 30 percent in the control section; and clay loam, silty clay loam, clay, cobbly clay or cobbly clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay in the lower part with halloysite as the dominant clay.  Rock fragments, mostly cobbles and gravel, range from 0 to 30 percent.  It ranges from moderately acid through neutral.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 55 to 75 percent, with some part 75 to 80 percent, and ranges 45 to 60 percent by sum of cations.
