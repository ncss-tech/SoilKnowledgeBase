Aftaden, Copperworld and Grinder soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section. Darktower soils have a lithic contact between 36 and 50 centimeters (14 and 20 inches). Sparkhule soils have a mean annual soil temperature range of 17 to 19 degrees C (63 to 67 degrees F) and do not receive appreciable summer precipitation. Aftaden, Darktower and Stonegold soils are formed from basalt. Zyplar soils are formed from rhyolitic ash-fall tuff and have a mean annual soil temperature of 15 to 18 degrees C (59 to 65 degrees F)."
