  "OVERVIEW": "The Jackmore series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loess over glacial moraine deposits derived from metamorphic rock.  Jackmore soils are on high elevation mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 600 cm, and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
