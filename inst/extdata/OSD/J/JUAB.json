  "REVDATE": "11/2007",
  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Juab series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in lacustrine deposits and alluvium from sedimentary, quartzite and igneous rock.  Juab soils are on alluvial fans, alluvial plains and lake plains and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
