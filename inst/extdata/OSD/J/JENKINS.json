  "OVERVIEW": "The Jenkins series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sedimentary rock.  Jenkins soils are on mountain sides and ridges at relatively high elevations and have slopes of 4 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 34 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 12 to 24 inches, and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The fine earth portion of the control section is typically sandy loam or loam and has 7 to 18 percent clay, 15 to 50 percent silt, and 30 to 70 percent sand.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent by volume and are mostly gravel and thin, flat fragments less than 10 inches in length.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  This horizon typically has weak platy structure that parts to fine granules and crumbs.  Dry consistence is soft or slightly hard.  Reaction ranges from pH 4.5 to 5.5.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Typically the horizon has subangular blocky structure.  Dry consistence is hard or slightly hard.  Reaction ranges from pH 4.5 to 5.5.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR.  Reaction ranges from 5.0 to 6.5."

Azwell soils have chroma of 2 to 4 in the B2 horizon, are dry in the summer, and formed in material weathered from mixed igneous rocks.  Hanks, Jughandle, Lake Janee, Liggett, Sambrito, and Walters soils are deeper than 40 inches to a lithic contact.  Bobtail soils have 15 to 75 percent of the sand fraction as medium, coarse, and very coarse sand and formed in material weathered from mixed igneous rocks.  Ryorp soils are slightly or medium acid; the mean annual soil temperature is above 38 degrees F. and the frost-free season is longer than 50 days."

The soils formed in moderately coarse textured, medium acid parent materials weathered from sandstone and shale.  At the type location, the average annual precipitation is 20 inches with generally uniform distribution occurring throughout the year.  The mean annual temperature is about 32 to 35 degrees F. and the frost-free season is about 20 days."
