  "OVERVIEW": "The Jordan series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Jordan soils are on low lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
