    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Junebee soils are on toeslopes of erosional fan remnants.  They formed in alluvium derived from Tertiary granitic sandstone, fanglomerate, and mudstone.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,100 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 15 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.   The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."
