  "OVERVIEW": "The Junebee series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitic sandstone, fanglomerate, and mudstone.  Junebee soils are on toeslopes of erosional fan remnants.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
