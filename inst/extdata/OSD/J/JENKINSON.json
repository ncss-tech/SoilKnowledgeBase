The control section is channery loam or channery clay loam. Clay averages 18 to 35 percent. Small slate-like fragments range from 15 to 35 percent. The soil is calcareous throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is channery loam or channery clay loam. This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is channery loam or channery clay loam. This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline."

Hazton soils are noncalcareous, have less than 18 percent clay in the control section, contain a high proportion of medium and coarse angular granite sand and gravel. Heisspitz soils are not calcareous and have a udic moisture regime. Lotex soils are not calcareous and are 8 to18 percent clay. Paddy, Skisams, Tuggle, and Udelope soils are not calcareous. Splitro soils are noncalcareous and have less than 18 percent clay in the control section. Dickle, Spliten, and Taylow soils are not calcareous and have a xeric moisture regime. Mucet soils formed in material weathered from basalt. Trump soils have continuous horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation and have cambic horizons."

The soils formed in parent material weathered from underlying interbedded sandstone and phyllitic shale. At the type location the average annual precipitation is about 18 to 24 inches. The average annual temperature is 36 to 42 degrees F. Elevations are 7,000 to 9,000 feet. The frost-free season is 60 to 90 days."
