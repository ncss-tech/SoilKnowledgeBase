  "OVERVIEW": "The Jimbee series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from limestone on ridges, foothills and mountains.  Permeability is  moderate.  Slopes are 10 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
