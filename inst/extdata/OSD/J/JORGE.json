    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jorge soils are on gently sloping to strongly sloping plateaus and hills and moderately steep and steep mountains at elevations of 1830 to 2745 meters. They formed in colluvium over residuum from volcanic flow rock of andesite, basalt, and latite. The climate is cool continental with mean annual precipitation which varies from 580 to 1450 mm. The mean annual temperature is 5 degrees C., mean January temperature is -5 degrees C., and mean July temperature is 14 degrees C. The average frost-free season is less than 90 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Jorge soils were formerly classified as members of the loamy-skeletal, mixed family of Typic Cryoboralfs. The cryic soil temperature regime was based upon a thumb rule that 0 horizons are not considered unless the thickness is greater than 3 inches. This concept is not considered to be valid in California and conflicts with Soil Taxonomy. Some pedons are described as having Bw horizons in the upper colluvial part of the profile.\nClassification was changed from Ultic Haploxeralfs after reviewing lab data, NSSL Pedon Number 00P0046\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
