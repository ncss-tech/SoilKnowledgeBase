  "REVDATE": "05/2011",
  "STATES": "IN,NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Junius series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on lake plains. They are nearly level soils that formed in permeable water deposited sandy material. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 47 to 51 degrees F. and mean annual percipitation is about 27 to 40 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 50 inches; depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 60 inches. Rock fragments are typically absent but fine gravel is present in the C horizon of some pedons. Unless limed, reaction is medium acid to neutral in the A horizon, slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the B horizon and neutral to moderately alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sandy loam. Undisturbed areas have A horizons 4 to 6 inches thick.\nThe B horizons have hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 through 4. Redoximorphic concentrations and/or depletions occur below a depth of 8 inches. Texture of the fine earth fraction is loamy fine sand or fine sand. Structure is granular, or it is single grain. Some pedons have a weak subangular blocky structure. Consistence is loose or friable. Some pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has colors similar to the B horizon, but generally has redoximorphic depletions with lower chroma. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, or very fine sand and is commonly stratified. Thin strata of loamy very fine sand occur in some pedons at depths greater than 40 inches. It is single grained, but in some pedons is massive."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Arloval, Carrolls, Conrad, Dair (T), Forbar, Gothenburg, Norway (T), Stafford, Tryon, Tyre and Wanser series are in the same family. Stafford soils are slightly acid or extremely acid in the C horizon. None of the other soils occur in Land Resource Region R. In addition, Arloval soils receive less rainfall. Conrad soils have buried A horizons. Dair does not have an OSD on file for differentiation. Gothenburg soils contain more rock fragments and are subject to frequent flooding. Norway and Wasner soils are calcareous throughout. Tryon soils lack B horizons and have buried A horizons. Tyre soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.\nThe Granby, Kingsville, Lamson, Minoa, Scarboro and Wareham are similar soils in related families. Granby soils have mollic epipedons. Kingsville soils are more acid and have darker surface layers than Junius soils. Scarboro soils have a histic epipedon. Wareham soils have Ap horizons with moist values of 3 or less and dry value of 5 or less. Lamson and Minoa soils have coarse-loamy pariticle-size control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Junius soils are nearly level soils on lake plains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The soils developed in calcareous sand dominated by quartz, feldspar, and ferromagnesian minerals. The climate is humid temperate and continental. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 27 to 40 inches; mean annual air temperature from 47 to 51 degrees F.; and the frost-free period ranges from 140 to 190 days."

The silty Niagara and Canandaigua soils and the better drained more acid sandy Colonie and Elnora soils on lake plains."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Many drained areas are used to grow hay, corn, vegetables, small fruit, or deciduous tree fruits. Undrained and partially drained areas are used for pasture, are idle, or wooded. Native vegetation consists of maple, elm, black and white ash, eastern white pine and other water tolerant species."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The temperature range previously bridged mesic and  frigid, the series has been restricted to the mesic range. Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Entisols order - the pedon lacks cambic horizon due to textures of loamy fine sand and fine sand in the B horizons.\n2. Aquents suborder -  the zone between 16 and 20 inches (Bg horizon) texture is loamy fine sand or coarser and 50% or more of matrix has hue of 10YR, chroma of 2 or less, and has redox concentrations.\n3. Psammaquents great group - the pedon has a sandy particle size in all horizons between 10 inches and 40 inches."
