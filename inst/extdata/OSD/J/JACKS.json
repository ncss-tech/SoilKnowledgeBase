The Lynx soils have mollic epipedons and are along drainageways within areas of Jacks soils. The Showlow soils have mollic epipedons and ca horizons at moderate depths. Springerville soils lack argillic horizons and crack deeply upon drying. Tortugas soils are shallow to bedrock and contain more than 50 percent coarse fragments."
