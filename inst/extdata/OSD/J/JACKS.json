Slopes are dominantly 0 to 15 percent and range from 0 to 45 percent. The average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 22 inches.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: In addition to the competing Disterheff, Dye and Hogg soils, these are the Lynx, Showlow, Springerville, and Tortugas soils. The Lynx soils have mollic epipedons and are along drainageways within areas of Jacks soils. The Showlow soils have mollic epipedons and ca horizons at moderate depths. Springerville soils lack argillic horizons and crack deeply upon drying. Tortugas soils are shallow to bedrock and contain more than 50 percent coarse fragments."
