Brycan soils have a cambic horizon.  Cordeston soils have carbonate at depths of 60 inches or more.  Dalmatian soils have low chroma redoximorphic features at 40 to 60 inches (102 to 152 cm) in depth.  Enbar and Polich soils have redox concentrations and seasonal high water tables within 100 cm..  Jode[r1] soils have accumulations of secondary carbonate in the particle size control section and typic ustic soil moisture regimes.  McGaffey soils have hue of 5YR or redder in more than half the profile.  Breezebasin, Nutrioso, Pinridge, Staad, and Straw soils have mollic epipedons less than 40 inches (100 cm) thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Jodero soils are on stream terraces, concave drainageways, fan skirts, fan remnants, and the concave portions of alluvial fans. Elevations range from 5,700 to 9,200 feet (1737 to 2,804 m). Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in thick, calcareous alluvium derived primarily from rhyolite, andesite, gneiss, dacite, basalt, tuff, and trachite. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 16 inches (200 to 406 mm) with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and summer months. Mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F. (3.9 to 7.2 degrees C.), mean summer temperature is 59 to 61 degrees F. (15.0 to 16.1 degrees C.), and the freeze-free period is 60 to 110 days."
