  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Juneau soils are on foot slopes in the glaciated landscape, commonly along the base of drumlins or morainic slopes or in intermittent drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  These soils formed in light-colored, stratified, recently deposited silty colluvium or alluvium over a buried soil. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.8 to 10.0 degrees C (46 to 50 degrees F)."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Juneau soils are associated in the landscape with Miami, Theresa, Dodge, McHenry, and St. Charles soils.  All of these soils are on higher topographic positions that contributed the colluvium in which Juneau soils formed.  Juneau soils form a drainage sequence with the somewhat poorly drained Orion and the poorly drained Washtenaw soils in nearly level or depressional sites."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained.  The potential for surface runoff ranges from negligible to medium.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14 .11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate. These soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of 107 to 183 cm (3.5 to 6 feet) for some time in most years."
