    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to the organic horizon varies from 21 to 35 inches.  Texture of solum is clay.  Consistence of solum is slightly sticky or sticky and plastic.  Reaction of the solum is slightly to mildly alkaline.  The mean annual soil temperature is 76 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hues of 10YR, values of 2 and 3, and chromas of 1 or 2.  Dark brown and yellowish mottles are usually present.  Structure is weak fine or medium subangular blocky which may part to granular.\nThe B1 horizon has hues of 10YR, values of 2 and 3, and chromas of 1 or 2.  High chroma mottles may be present.\nThe gley B2 horizons have hues of 10YR to 5Y, values of 2 to 5, and chromas of 1 or 2.  Structure is weak fine to coarse subangular blocky.  Pressure faces may or may not be present.\nThe organic layer consists of black, highly decomposed materials with less than 5 percent fiber."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Reparada series in the same family.  The Bajura, Coloso, Corcega, Fortuna, Igualdad, Maunabo, Perchas, Pinones, Santoni, Talante and Vayas series are similar soils in related family.  The Reparada soils have an ustic moisture regime.  All of these soils, except, Pinones lack underlying organic layers.  The Pinones soils are acid throughout the profile."

They formed in clay sediments of mixed origin overlying decomposed organic materials.  The climate is humid.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 60 to 70 inches.  The mean annual termperature is 77 degrees F."
