  "OVERVIEW": "The Jayem series consists of very deep, well to somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sediments weathered from noncalcareous sandstone. Jayem soils are on uplands and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
