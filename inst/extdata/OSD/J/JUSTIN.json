Clay content ranges from 24 to 40 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt3 horizons have redoximorphic concentrations in colors of red, yellowish red, brown, strong brown, yellowish brown, or olive brown.  Some pedons have redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less below a depth of 40 inches.  Texture is clay loam or clay.  Some pedons have C horizons of with redoximorphic features of brown, red, brownish gray, or gray, and have textures of sandy clay, sandy clay loam, or shaly clay below 60 inches depth.
