Content of fine nodules and fragments of ironstone ranges from none to about 5 percent throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) or brown (10YR 4/3; 7.5YR 5/2, 4/2).  It is loam or fine sandy loam and slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt1 horizon is brown (10YR 5/3; 7.5YR 4/2, 5/4), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6), pale brown (10YR 6/3), light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), yellowish red (5YR 5/6, 5/8), or reddish brown (5YR 5/3, 5/4).  Redoximorphic concentrations of dark red (2.5YR 3/6), red (2.5YR 4/6), yellowish red (5YR 4/6), or strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) range from none to common.  It is sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam with clay content ranging from 24 to 35 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt2 horizon is brown (10YR 5/3; 7.5YR 5/4), grayish brown (10YR 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2), light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6; 5YR 6/6), reddish brown (5YR 5/4), or yellowish red (5YR 5/6).  It has common coarse red, yellowish red, or reddish yellow redoximorphic concentrations if hues are 10YR or yellower.  Texture is clay loam or sandy clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 24 to 40 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt3 horizons have redoximorphic concentrations in colors of red, yellowish red, brown, strong brown, yellowish brown, or olive brown.  Some pedons have redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less below a depth of 40 inches.  Texture is clay loam or clay.  Some pedons have C horizons of with redoximorphic features of brown, red, brownish gray, or gray, and have textures of sandy clay, sandy clay loam, or shaly clay below 60 inches depth.
