  "OVERVIEW": "The Jovine series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Jovine soils are on depressions and low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
