  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to mucky peat (hemic material) is 25 to 35 inches.  Some pedons are underlain by mineral soil at a depth greater than 46 inches.  All organic material is from herbaceous plants.  The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F. Soils are frozen from the 0 to 8 inch depth in winter.  A perennial water table is at a depth of 1.5 to 2.5 feet. The soils are frequently ponded with up to 3 feet of water on the surface from March to September.\nThe surface tier (0 to 12 inches, Oa and 2Bw horizon) is muck with thin strata mineral soil.  Buried or overwash phases are recognized; where present texture is silt loam and is 6 to 12 inches thick.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe subsurface tier (12 to 36 inches, 3Oa and 3Oe1) is muck or mucky peat; mucky peat textures occur below a depth of 30 inches.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe bottom tier (36 to 51 inches, 3Oe1 and 3Oe2) is mucky peat and mineral soil material; may occur below a depth of 46 inches.  It is neutral."

Skidoosprings and Mcbain soils are on higher terraces. Doubleo soils are on slightly higher terraces. Fury soils are poorly drained. Housefield soils are on the same terrace as Jimgreen soils, but have mucky silt loam textures throughout."
