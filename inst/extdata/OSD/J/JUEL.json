  "REVDATE": "02/2016",
  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Juel series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum weathered from sandstone and shale. These soils are on hillslopes and pediments.  Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.",
