  "OVERVIEW": "The Juniperlake series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in tephra and till from andesite and basalt. Juniperlake soils are on ground moraines in the Southern Cascade mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 49 inches (1245 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F, (5 degrees C).",
