  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 6 to 24 inches.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 0 to 6 inches.\nSome pedons contain an A horizon, which has color and texture ranges similar to the E horizon.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 (dry or moist).  It is typically loam, but ranges to include silt loam and very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is strongly or very strongly alkaline.  Sodium adsorption ratio ranges from 13 to 20 and exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 5 to 35.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 (dry or moist).  It is typically loam or silt loam, but the range includes very fine sandy loam, clay loam and silty clay loam.  Reaction is strongly or very strongly alkaline.  Sodium adsorption ratio ranges from 13 to 90 and exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 15 to about 100.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 (dry or moist).  It is typically loam and silt loam with the range including very fine sandy loam.  Thin subhorizons of loamy fine sand and coarse sand are in some pedons. Below a depth of 40 inches the material ranges from silt loam to sand with less than 10 percent gravel by volume.  Reaction is strongly or very strongly alkaline.  Sodium adsorption ratio ranges from 13 to 40 and exchangeable sodium ranges from 15 to about 110.  Redoximorphic features are few or common, faint or distinct and fine or medium."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Janise soils are nearly level to very gently sloping and on alluvial fans and bottom lands.  They formed in mixed alluvium.  Slope gradient ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  The range of mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches, and the range of mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Glenberg, Las Animas, Lisco, Minatare, Mitchell and Yockey soils.  Glenberg, Las Animas, Lisco, Minatare and Yockey soils are on similar landscapes.  Glenberg soils contain more sand in the particle-size control section.  Las Animas soils are coarse-loamy and have sodium saturation percentage of less than 15 and a sodium absorption ratio less than 13.  Lisco soils are coarse-loamy.  Minatare soils are in the fine family. Yockey soils do not have a B horizon and are less alkaline in the particle-size control section.  Mitchell soils do not have a B horizon, are less alkaline in the particle-size control section and are well drained."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 1 inch (E horizon).  They have an exchangable sodium percentage(ESP) of 15 or more and sodium adsorption ratio(SAR) of 13 or more in one-half or more of the soil within 20 inches of the soil surface.\nThe Janise soils were formerly correlated as an alkali phase of the Mitchell series.  In some survey areas, they were included with the Minatare soils.  Some areas of Janise soils contain appreciable amounts of volcanic glass, particularly where siltstone is the principal source of the parent material.  Other phases recognized include a drained phase, a sandy substratum phase, an overblown phase and a drained, overblown phase.\nLaboratory data indicates the series may be fine-silty, have a natric horizon and enough organic carbon to have a mollic epipedon.  Consideration should be given to classifying the series as fine-silty Typic Natraqualfs or Typic Natraquolls.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data in the National Soil Survey Laboratory - sample numbers S62NE079-001, S62NE079-002, S79NE013-001 and S93NE123-001.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
