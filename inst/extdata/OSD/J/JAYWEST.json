  "OVERVIEW": "The Jaywest series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from shale.  Jaywest soils are on relict terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants, valley filling positions and on lower components of hills and ridges.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 36 inches.  Depth to accumulations of calcium carbonate ranges from 13 to 27 inches.  Rock fragments typically average less than 5 percent channers throughout but range from 0 to 15 percent channers.  The moisture control section is usually moist in some or all parts in March through June.  The average annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  Some pedons have an A horizon.  Some pedons are stratified below the argillic horizon with sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, loam, clay loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  In pedons where the color requirements are met for a mollic epipedon, the horizon is either too thin or lacks the organic carbon requirements for a mollic epipedon.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have an EB horizon up to 5 inches thick.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay, silty clay loam or clay.  It has 35 to 55 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent sand, less than 20 percent of which is fine and coarser sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay, silty clay loam or clay.  It averages 35 to 50 percent clay, but may have subhorizons with 30 to 35 percent clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 3 to 12 percent.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is commonly loam or clay loam and less commonly sandy clay loam.  It has 5 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  It has an EC of 8 to 16 mmhos/cm in some pedons."

Moorhead soils lack E horizons and do not have an abrupt textural boundary between the A and Bt horizons.\nThese are the Cromack (P), Deekay, Moorhead, Oldwolf, Samsil, and Spottedhorse soils.  Cromack and Samsil lack argillic horizons and are calcareous throughout.  Deekay and Oldwolf soils are fine-loamy in the particle-size control section.  Moorhead soils lack E horizons and do not have an abrupt textural boundary between the A and Bt horizons. Spottedhorse soils are moderately deep.  Cromack, Oldwolf, Samsil, and Spottedhorse soils occur on shoulders and crests of hills and ridges.  Deekay and Moorhead are on footslopes."
