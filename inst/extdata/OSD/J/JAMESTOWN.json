Jamestown soils formed in recent alluvium over dense till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1067 mm (32 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 11.1 degrees C (50 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation is 177 to 466 meters (580 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level."

The poorly drained Brookston soils formed in till and are on higher lying footslopes adjacent to dissected till plains and moraines. The very poorly drained Sloan soils are in backswamps and have a mollic epipedon. The poorly drained Southwest soils have a buried soil and are on toeslopes adjacent to dissected till plains, moraines, and terraces. The somewhat poorly drained Waterford soils are on natural levees and higher lying flood-plain steps."

Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) for some time in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part of the solum and high or very high in the lower part, and moderately low or low in the underlying dense till. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and moderately rapid or rapid in the lower part, and slow or very slow in the underlying dense till. These soils are occasionally flooded for brief duration."
