  "REVDATE": "04/2000",
  "STATES": "NE",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Jankosh series consists of somewhat poorly drained loamy alluvial soils that are moderately deep over gravelly sand on river valley floodplains. Permeability is moderate in the loamy upper part and very rapid in the gravelly lower part.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 17 inches at the type location.",

It may be stratified in color and texture. Jankosh soils were previously mapped as Janise, sandy substratum or an alkali phase of the Gering series."
