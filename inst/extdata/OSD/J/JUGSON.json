  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to hard bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is about 30 degrees to 40 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 40 degrees to 47 degrees F.\nThe O and E horizons are absent or indistinct in some pedons where the surface has been disturbed or burned.\nThe B2w horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam. Base saturation is about 35 to 45 percent and the pH ranges from about 5.0 to 6.1.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. The C1 horizon commonly contains splotches of stronger colors and one to several very thin, wavy, horizontal clayey bands (lamellae). Base saturation of the C horizon is 60 to 80 percent and the pH ranges from about 5.5 to 6.0."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Jugson soils are on mountainous slopes, usually with a northerly aspect. Slopes are 5 to 70 percent. They formed in residuum from granite, quartz, monzonite, gneiss or similar coarse-grained acid igneous bedrock. Elevations are 3,300 to 7,000 feet. Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 45 inches. Mean annual temperature is 29 degrees to 39 degrees F. Frost-free season is 10 to 70 days."
