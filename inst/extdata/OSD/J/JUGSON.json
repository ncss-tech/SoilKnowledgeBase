  "OVERVIEW": "The Jugson series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in material weathered from granite. Jugson soils are on mountains and have slopes of 5 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 34 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to hard bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is about 30 degrees to 40 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 40 degrees to 47 degrees F.\nThe O and E horizons are absent or indistinct in some pedons where the surface has been disturbed or burned.\nThe B2w horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam. Base saturation is about 35 to 45 percent and the pH ranges from about 5.0 to 6.1.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. The C1 horizon commonly contains splotches of stronger colors and one to several very thin, wavy, horizontal clayey bands (lamellae). Base saturation of the C horizon is 60 to 80 percent and the pH ranges from about 5.5 to 6.0."
