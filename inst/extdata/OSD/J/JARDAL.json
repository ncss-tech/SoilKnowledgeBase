    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 66 to 71 degrees F.  The soil moisture regime is Xeric bordering on Aridic.\nRock fragments on the surface range from 25 to 75 percent and consists of gravel, cobbles, and stones.  Depth to the calcic horizon is 9 to 15 inches.  Depth to the petrocalcic horizon is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle size control section averages 10 to 18 percent clay with individual subhorizons ranging from 5 to 18 percent clay.  Rock fragment content ranges averages 35 to 70 percent in the particle size control section with some individual subhorizons ranging from 70 to 90 percent.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is a gravelly very fine sandy loam or very gravelly very fine sandy loam. Content of gravel is 15 to 50 percent and the content of the cobbles is 0 to 15 percent.  Effervescence is very slight to slight and the reaction is moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 5 to 15 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has a hue of 10YR, value 3 or 4 moist, chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is a very gravelly very fine sandy loam, very cobbly very fine sandy loam, or very gravelly loam.  Rock fragment content is 35 to 60 percent.  Effervescence is strong to violent and the reaction is moderately to strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 40 percent.\nThe Bk horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 7 or 8 dry, 6 or 7 moist, chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is an extremely gravelly very fine sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly loam, or extremely gravelly sandy loam.  Rock fragment content is 35 to 70 percent.  Effervescence is violent and the reaction is strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 40 to 70 percent."

These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from conglomerate, sandstone, and quartzite.  Average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F., and the freeze free season is 100 to 130 days."
