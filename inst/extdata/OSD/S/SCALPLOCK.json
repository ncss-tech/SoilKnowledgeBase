  "OVERVIEW": "The Scalplock series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from metasedimentary rock.  These soils are on mountain slopes and cirque headwalls. Slopes are 8 to 80 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1,825 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 2.0 degrees C.",
