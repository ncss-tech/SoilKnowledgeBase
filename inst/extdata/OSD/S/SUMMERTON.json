The soil is very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A horizon and extremely acid to strongly acid in the rest of the profile.  Some pedons have a few flakes of mica in the upper part of the B horizon and few to many flakes of mica in the lower part.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  A or Ap horizons with value of less than 3.5 are less than 6 inches thick.  Some pedons have a thin Ap horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The A horizon is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 or 6.  The E horizon is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe AB horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4to 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  It is clay loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon of most pedons has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8, with few to common mottles in shades of yellow or brown.  Some pedons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 6 or 8, with few to common mottles in shades of red.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 6 or 8 with common to many mottles in shades of yellow or brown; or it is mottled in shades of red, yellow, or brown.  Some pedons have mottles of chroma 2 or less in the lower part of the Bt horizon.  The Bt horizon is firm or very firm, hard, or very hard.  It is clay, sandy clay, or clay loam.\nThe BC horizon, where present, is mottled in shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray, or it has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 6 or 8 with mottles in shades of brown, yellow, or gray.  It is clay, sandy clay, clay loam, or sandy clay loam."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dewey, Fullerton, Henderson, Lugoff, Marlboro, and Waynesboro series in the same family and the Caroline, Collegedale, Shubuta, Tiak, and Turbeville series.  Dewey soils are underlain by limestone and have a higher component of silt throughout.  Fullerton and Henderson soils have coarse fragments of chert throughout the profile.  Lugoff soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower and more than 15 percent rock fragments in the upper Bt horizon.  Marlboro and Waynesboro soils have uniform colors in the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Caroline, Collegedale, Shubuta, Tiak, and Turbeville series are similar soils in other families and have mixed mineralogy."
