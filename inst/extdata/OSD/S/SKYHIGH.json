The soil is dry in all parts of the moisture control section (6 to 19 inches) from July 1 to October 30 and is moist in all parts of the moisture control section from January 1 to April 30. The particle-size control section (8 to 38 inches) averages from 35 to 50 percent clay. Horizons that have mollic colors are 4 to 14 inches thick and are either massive and hard when dry, or have less than 0.7 percent organic carbon below 6 inches.\nThe A horizon has dry colors of lOYR 4/4, 4/3,  5/2, or 5/3; 7.5YR 5/3 or 4/4 and moist colors of lOYR 3/1, 3/2, or 3/3; 7.5YR 4/3, 3/3. Texture is loam with O to 15 percent pebbles. Reaction is moderately acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizons have dry colors of lOYR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3 or 5/4; 7.5YR 4/4, 4/3 and moist colors of lOYR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 4/6 or 5/4; 7.5YR 4/4, 4/3, 3/3. The lower part of this horizon commonly has variegated lOYR and 7.5YR colors. Texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay and has O to 35 percent gravels.
