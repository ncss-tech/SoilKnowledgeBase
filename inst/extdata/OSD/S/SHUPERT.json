(parts of the C1, C2 and C3 horizons)\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 10 cm.  (A horizon)\nRedoximorphic features:  masses of oxidized iron from 160 to 188 cm (C6 horizon)\nFluvent feature:  Irregular decrease of organic carbon from a depth of 25 to 125 cm; or at least 0.2 percent organic carbon of Holocene age at a depth of 125 cm below the soil surface\nThese soils were formerly classified as Typic Ustifluvents, loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid.  The type location was moved to Emery County and the soil moisture regime was changed from typic ustic in April 2008 since the original type location is no longer mapped Shupert.\nCapillary rise may occur below a depth of 152 cm which may account for masses of oxidized iron in horizons below this depth.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
