  "OVERVIEW": "The Settlement series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Settlement soils are on lake plains, lake terraces, and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
