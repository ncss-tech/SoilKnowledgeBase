All of these soils lack bedrock above depth of 40 inches except the Malm and Vining soils.  Bertelson soils are loamy sand in the upper 20 inches, are strongly calcareous throughout, and have weakly lime-cemented layers.  Declo and Palisade soils are dominantly medium textured in the control section.  Eccles soils have strongly calcareous sola and bedrock below depth of 40 inches.  Holsine, Malm and Matheson soils have average annual soil temperatures colder than 47 degrees F.  Kecko soils are noncalcareous to depths of 20 to 30 inches.  Palisade soils have 20 to 40 percent lime in the calcic horizon.  Vining soils lack calcic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevations range from 3,000 to 4,660 feet.  The climate is semiarid and has dry summers.  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, including 1 to 3 feet of snow, and the average frost-free period is 115 to 140 days."
