  "OVERVIEW": "The Sarpy series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils on flood plains. These soils formed in sandy alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 86 centimeters (34 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
