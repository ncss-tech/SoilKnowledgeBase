These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived dominantly from shale, sandstone, chert, conglomerate, and welded tuff with a component of loess.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,710 to 2,350 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 280 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
