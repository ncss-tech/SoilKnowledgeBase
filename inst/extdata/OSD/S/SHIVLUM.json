  "OVERVIEW": "The Shivlum series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rocks with a component of loess.  Shivlum soils are on mountains, hills, fan remnants, and partial ballenas.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
