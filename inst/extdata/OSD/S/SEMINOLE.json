  "OVERVIEW": "The Seminole series consists of deep, moderately well drained,\nslowly permeable soils that formed in clayey sediments or material weathered from shale of Permian age.  These soils occur on nearly level to gently sloping upland prairies..  Slopes range\nfrom 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 1,041 mm (41 in).",
