  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid, except where limed.  Most pedons have a clay distribution where the percentage of clay decreases from its maximum amount by more than 20 percent within 60 inches of the soil surface.  In these pedons, the layers in which the percentage of clay decreases by more than 20 percent has skeletans on faces of peds.  If the skeletans were not present, the percent clay would not decrease by more than 20 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or is neutral, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 3.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sand, or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture ranges is comparable to the A or Ap horizon.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 5.  Texture range is comparable to the A or Ap horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It contains mottles with value of 4 or greater and chroma of 2 or less.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  The Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or it is neutral, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2 with few to many mottles with higher chroma.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe BCg horizon, where present, is similar in color and texture to the Btg.\nThe C horizon. where present, is similar in color to the Btg horizon.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or fine sand."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Soils in closely related families are the Barth, Bertie, Dragston, Foreston, Johns, Kenansville, Lynchburg, Mattapex, Nahunta, Olanta, Pactolus, Rumfort, Woodington, and Woodstown series.  Barth soils have sandy argillic horizons.  Bertie, Johns, Lynchburg, and Nahunta soils have more than 18 percent clay in the Bt horizons.  Dragston soils have solum thickness less than 40 inches.  Foreston soils lack chroma of 2 or less in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Kenansville, Olanta, and Rumfort soils lack chroma 2 mottles within 24 inches of the top of the argillic horizon and in addition, the Kenansville soils have arenic surfaces.  Mattapex and Woodstown soils have mean annual soil temperature less than 59 degrees F., and have more than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Pactolus soils are sandy throughout and lack argillic horizons.  Woodington soils lack chroma of 3 or higher below the A or Ap horizon."

These soils formed in coarse-textured Coastal Plain sediments.  The mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 48 inches near the type location."
