The depth to the upper boundary of the Bt ranges from 30 to 42 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 51 to\n58 degrees F.  Reaction ranges from neutral through medium acid in the solum.  Coarse fragments are dominately stones, but include pebbles and cobbles in a range of 35 to 70 percent in the particle size control section.\nThe A1 and A2 horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry and 3 through\n5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist\nand chroma of 3 through 6.  It ranges from clay loam to clay textures with clay from 35 to 55 percent."
