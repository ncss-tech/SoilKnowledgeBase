  "OVERVIEW": "The Shelby series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in pre-Illinoian till.  These soils are on convex side slopes, crests, and narrow interfluves on dissected till plains.  Slope ranges from 1 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 890 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
