Appleseed soils have 15 to 35 percent calcium carbonate equivalence and limestone bedrock. Goldroad soils have control sections dominated by coarse and very coarse sand and formed on granite. Hyder and Quilotosa soils are intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for more than 20 days cumulative during July-September. Redneedle soils are dry in the soil moisture control section July to September."
