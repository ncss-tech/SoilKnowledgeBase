  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sacahuista soils are on slopes and summits of mountains, hills and ridges. Slope ranges from 1 to 100 percent. These soils formed in residuum, colluvium and eolian materials that overlie indurated limestone or dolomite bedrock.  Elevations are 3,400 to 7,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  Precipitation falls mostly as high intensity rain during afternoon thunderstorms from July to September.  Mean annual air temperature is 57 to 61 degrees F.  The the frost-free period is 212 to 246 days."
