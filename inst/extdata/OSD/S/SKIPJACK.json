  "OVERVIEW": "The Skipjack series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium from glacial drift, metasedimentary bedrock, and volcanic ash.  Skipjack soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes.  Slope ranges from 5 to 15 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 1,015 millimeters and the average annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
