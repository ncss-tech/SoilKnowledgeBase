Kapowsin soils formed in dense glacial till, have redoximorphic features within 100 cm, and are 50 to 100 cm deep to a pan cemented with aluminum, iron, and organic matter.  Menzel soils are medial in the A and Bw horizons, and have pH ranging from slightly acid to neutral in the particle-size control section.   Sadie soils have a densic contact at 65 to 100 cm and have redoximorphic features within 100 cm."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Skipjack soils occur on hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slope ranges from 5 to 15 percent and elevations range from 0 to 732 meters.  The soils formed in colluvium from glacial drift, bedrock of metasedimentary lithology, and volcanic ash.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, moist winters with intermittent snow cover.  The annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 1,140 millimeters.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 9 degrees C.  The frost-free season is 160 to 220 days."
