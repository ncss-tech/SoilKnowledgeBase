  "OVERVIEW": "The Skalan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from gneiss and other related metamorphic rocks with an influence of volcanic ash and loess in the upper part. Skalan soils are on rolling to very steep uplands and have slopes of 5 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The soils are on all aspects at lower elevations and mainly on south and west slopes at the higher elevations. Skalan soils formed in material weathered from gneiss and other related metamorphic rocks, with an influence of volcanic ash and loess in the upper part. The climate is characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 27 inches. The mean January temperature is 28 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 66 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 45 degrees to 49 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."

Kruse and Schumacher soils are fine-loamy and are on mountain and foothill side slopes. Lenz and Spokane soils do not have argillic horizons and are on mountain and foothill side slopes. Moscow and Ulricher soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Moscow soils are on foot slopes, back slopes, and ridges of mountains. Ulricher soils are on mountains. Molly and Vassar soils have contrasting particle-size control sections. Molly soils are on rolling to very steep mountain side slopes. Vassar soils are on mountains."
