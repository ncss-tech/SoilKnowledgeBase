  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Scotmont series consists of very deep, well drained soils that have a component of volcanic ash in the surface layers, and formed in glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on lake plains and terraces. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
