Depth to the 2B horizon ranges from 20 to 36 inches.  The lower part of the particle size control section contains 35 to 75 percent coarse fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw1 horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist.  It is gravelly loam, gravelly silt loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw2 and Bw3 horizons have value of 3 to 6 dry or moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly loam, gravelly loam, or gravelly fine sandy loam.\nThe 2Bkq or 2Bk horizon is extremely gravelly, very gravelly, very cobbly or extremely cobbly coarse sand.
