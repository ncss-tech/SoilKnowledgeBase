  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 61 to 64 degrees F.  These soils typically are noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches but depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to the sandy-skeletal IIC horizon ranges from 12 to 25 inches.  Exchangeable sodium typically is more than 4 percent in the upper part of the control section but ranges from 0 to 14 percent in a majority of subhorizons of the control section.  Exchangeable sodium percentage decreases as depth increases.  The upper part of the control section is usually a sandy loam but clay averages 5 to 18 percent, silt 0 to 40 percent, and sand 50 to 95 percent.  Rock fragments in the upper part of the control section range from 0 to 35 percent and are typically less than 3 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Reaction is moderately to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  Reaction is mildly to strongly alkaline."

The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F."
