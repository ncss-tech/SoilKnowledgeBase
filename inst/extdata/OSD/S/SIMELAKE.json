The Urbo series is Southern Coastal Plain and the Blackland Prairie Major Land Resource Areas.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in).\nOchric  epipedon: 0 to 15  cm (0 to 6 in). (A horizon)\nCambic horizon: 15 to 54 cm (6 to 21 in) (Bw horizon)\nSlickensides: 54 to 203 cm (21 to 80 in) (Bss, Bssg1, Bssg2 horizons)\nAquic conditions:  15 to 203 cm (6 to 80 in)\nAdditional Comments: The mineralogy is based on lab data from the type location.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL data available on pedon S12TX1991026. Particle-size analysis and pH tests were performed at the project office on 8 pedons.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
