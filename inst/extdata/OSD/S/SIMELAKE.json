  "OVERVIEW": "The Simelake series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in clayey alluvial deposits of Holocene age.  These soils are on flood plain flats.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent but mainly less than 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1422 mm (56 in).",
