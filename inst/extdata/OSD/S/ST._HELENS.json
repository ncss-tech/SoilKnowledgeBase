  "OVERVIEW": "The St. Helens series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in layers of aerially deposited pumice and volcanic ash over pyroclastic flows and lahars.  They are on terraces at elevations of 1,600 to 2,800 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 130 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

St. Helens soils formed in layers of aerially deposited pumice and volcanic ash over pyroclastic flows and lahars.  Beginning from the surface of the mineral soil the stratigraphy of pyroclastic material represented in a typical profile includes: (1) fresh ash from the 176-year-old \"Layer T\", (2) pumice from the 400-year- old \"Layer W\", (3) and (4) ash, pumice, and scoria from the 2,500-year-old  \"B set\", and (5) pyroclastic flows from the 3,000-year-old \"P set.\"  The climate is characterized by warm, moist summers and cold, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 125 to 135 inches including considerable snowfall.   Mean annual air temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 110 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 9 inches, and a cambic horizon from 9 to 28 inches; sandy-skeletal material is at 28 inches.  The particle-size control section is from the mineral soil surface to 40 inches and has three contrasting particle-size classes; from 0 to 6 inches qualifying as ashy; from 6 to 9 inches qualifying as ashy-pumiceous; 9 to 18 inches qualifying as medial; from 18 to 28 inches qualifying as ashy; and from 28 to 40 inches qualifying as sandy-skeletal.  The particle-size class was based on the contrasting ashy layer (4BC horizon) over the sandy or sandy-skeletal layer (5C horizon).  Classification changes 6/98 based on 1998 Keys to Soil Taxonomy."
