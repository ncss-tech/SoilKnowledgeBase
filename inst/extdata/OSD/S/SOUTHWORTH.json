    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum is 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) thick and extends to a lithic contact. Mean annual soil temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C. (42 to 47 degrees F.). These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 10 to 31 centimeters (4 and 12 inches) for 60 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Organic matter content decreases to less than one percent above a depth of 50 centimeters (20 inches). The particle-size control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay and 5 to 25 percent sand in the fine earth fraction.  Rock fragments consist of channers and flagstones from shale or mudstone.  Base saturation ranges from 75 to 85 percent.\nThe A horizon has dominant hue of 10YR, but may include 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist or dry.  It is ashy loam with 18 to 27 percent clay and 10 to 65 percent channers and flagstones.  It has 5 to 15 percent volcanic glass and 0.4 to 0.8 percent acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron.  Soil reaction is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe ABt horizon, when present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  Texture is ashy silt loam or ashy loam and has 10 to 50 percent channers and flagstones. It averages 18 to 27 percent clay.  It has 5 to 15 percent volcanic glass and 0.4 to 0.8 percent acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron.  Soil reaction is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or l0YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry. Texture is dominantly silty clay loam, but includes silt loam and clay loam. It averages 25 to 35 percent clay and 35 to 70 percent flagstones and channers.  Soil reaction is neutral to moderately acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Southworth soils are on back slopes of hills and mountains  at an elevation of 1219 to 1890 meters (4,000 to 6,200 feet). At higher elevations, Southworth soils are only found on south slopes.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. The soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from shale and mudstone with an influence of Mazama volcanic ash in the surface. Summers are hot and dry and winters are cold and wet. Mean annual precipitation is 38 to 100 centimeters (15 to 40 inches). Mean January temperature is -4 to -3 degrees C. (24 to 27 degrees F.); mean July temperature is 17 to 19 degrees C. (63 to 67 degrees F.); and mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C. (40 to 45 degrees F.). Frost-free period is 60 to 120 days."

Piersonte soils are on forested footslopes, are deep or very deep to fractured shale, and lack an argillic horizon.  The Laycock soils are on forested ridgetops and benches and are shallow to fractured shale.  The Logdell soils are on mountain mahogany ridgetops or adjacent to exposed shale bedrock on hillsides and are very shallow to fractured shale."
