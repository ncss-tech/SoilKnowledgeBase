  "OVERVIEW": "The Southworth series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium derived from shale and mudstone with an influence of ash in the surface.  Southworth soils are on side slopes of mountains and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 76 cm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C. (42 degrees F.).",

(42 to 47 degrees F.). These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 10 to 31 centimeters (4 and 12 inches) for 60 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Organic matter content decreases to less than one percent above a depth of 50 centimeters (20 inches). The particle-size control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay and 5 to 25 percent sand in the fine earth fraction.  Rock fragments consist of channers and flagstones from shale or mudstone.  Base saturation ranges from 75 to 85 percent.\nThe A horizon has dominant hue of 10YR, but may include 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist or dry.  It is ashy loam with 18 to 27 percent clay and 10 to 65 percent channers and flagstones.  It has 5 to 15 percent volcanic glass and 0.4 to 0.8 percent acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron.  Soil reaction is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe ABt horizon, when present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  Texture is ashy silt loam or ashy loam and has 10 to 50 percent channers and flagstones. It averages 18 to 27 percent clay.  It has 5 to 15 percent volcanic glass and 0.4 to 0.8 percent acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron.  Soil reaction is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or l0YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry. Texture is dominantly silty clay loam, but includes silt loam and clay loam. It averages 25 to 35 percent clay and 35 to 70 percent flagstones and channers.  Soil reaction is neutral to moderately acid."

At higher elevations, Southworth soils are only found on south slopes.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. The soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from shale and mudstone with an influence of Mazama volcanic ash in the surface. Summers are hot and dry and winters are cold and wet. Mean annual precipitation is 38 to 100 centimeters (15 to 40 inches). Mean January temperature is -4 to -3 degrees C. (24 to 27 degrees F.); mean July temperature is 17 to 19 degrees C. (63 to 67 degrees F.); and mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C. (40 to 45 degrees F.). Frost-free period is 60 to 120 days."
