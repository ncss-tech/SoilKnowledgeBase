  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 5 to 12 inches.  Depth to sand, gravel, and cobbles is 10 to 20 inches.  The mean soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 48 to 50 degrees F.   The mean summer soil temperature is 62 to 68 degrees F.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate is 5 to 12 inches.  Calcium carbonate equivalent in the Cca horizon ranges from 6 to 15 percent.  Coarse fragments, mainly basalt gravel and cobbles, range from 10 to 35 percent in the major portion of the solum.  The sand and silt fractions contain about 2 to 10 percent dark gray or reddish brown ferromagnesian rich minerals and fragments of basalt.  The A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  The Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It has weak or moderate prismatic or subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is sandy clay loam, clay loam or loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay, 10 to 50 percent silt, and 20 to 70 percent sand.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  The BCk horizon above the skeletal material has hue of 5Y through 10YR.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ethete, Garland, Hough, and Ornea series.  Ethete soils have contrasting sand and gravel at depths of 20 to 40 inches and have calcic horizons.  Garland and Hough soils have contrasting sand and gravel below a depth of 20 inches. Ornea soils have 15 to 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the Bk horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sharland soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping alluvial fans, pediment surfaces, and old terrace levels at elevations of 3,800 to 5,200 feet.  Slopes typically range from 0 to about 10 percent or more.  These soils formed in thin, calcareous, alluvial materials derived mainly from basalt.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 7 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual temperature is 45 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 69 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 110 to 140 days."
