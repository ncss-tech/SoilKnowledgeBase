  "OVERVIEW": "The Sherlock series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial till with a mantle of volcanic ash. Sherlock soils are on glaciated foothills and valleys and have slopes of 0 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The average annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F. These soils are dry in the moisture control section less than 45 consecutive days following summer solstice and are continual moist in winter and spring. The thickness of the solum ranges from 32 to greater than 60 inches. Thickness of the volcanic ash mantle and depth to the 2Bt horizon is 7 to l4 inches. The upper 7 to 14 inches is 30 to 60 percent volcanic glass. The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon averages 20 to 35 percent clay and averages 35 to 60 percent coarse fragments.\nThe E horizon, when present, has value 6 or 7 when dry, 4 or 5 when moist, and chroma of l or 2 when dry or moist. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid. Some pedons have an A horizon and lack an E horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or l0YR, a value of 4 to 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6 dry or moist. It is ashy loam, or ashy silt loam and modified by 0 to 30 percent pebbles. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has a hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist. It is heavy silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam, modified by 35 to 50 percent pebbles and 0 to l5 percent cobbles. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral."

The soils are in a continental climate with cool, dry summers and cold, moist winters. The average annual precipitation is 35 to 60 inches. The average annual temperature is 39 to 42 degrees F.
