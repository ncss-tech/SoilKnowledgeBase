Base saturation throughout the argillic horizon ranges from 35 to 75 percent.  Ironstone pebbles less than 15 mm across range from 0 to 15 percent by volume.\nThe combined A and E horizons range from 10 to 20 inches thick.  The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.   The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.

Masses of iron accumulation range from few to many in shades of red, yellow or brown.  Texture is clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt3 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of red and yellow range from few to many.  Mottles in shades of gray, where present, are inherited from parent materials.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These soils include the Birome, Bonti, Darst, Gause, Jedd, Rosanky, and Travis series.  Similar soils are the Chazos, Gasil, and Tabor series.  Birome, Bonti, Darst, and Jedd soils have sola 20 to 40 inches thick to a paralithic contact.  In addition, these series have epipedons that averages less than 12 inches thick and have dominant hue redder than 7.5YR in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Gause and Travis soils have sola from 60 to greater than 80 inches thick.  In addition, Travis soils formed in alluvium and have redder hue in the argillic horizon.  Rosanky soils have sola 40 to 60 inches thick to a paralithic contact.  In addition, Rosanky soils have redder upper Bt horizons.  Chazos soils have zones of iron depletion due to wetness within 30 inches of the surface.  Gasil soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Tabor soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy and have vertic properties."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Spiller soils are on gently sloping erosional uplands.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  These soils generally have drainage basin relief of no more than 25 feet.  They are on narrow summits, shoulder, and backslope positions.  Slopes are commonly convex in the vertical slope direction and linear in the horizontal slope direction.  Spiller soils formed in thinly stratified loamy and clayey sediments of the Tertiary Age, mainly of the Cook Mountain Formation.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 66 to 69 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 42 inches.  Frost free days range from 250 to 280 days, and elevation ranges from 275 to 650 feet.  The Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 52 to 64."

Crockett soils are on broad linear and convex slopes in lower positions and have thin A horizons and vertic properties.  Rader and Tabor soils occur on lower linear and concave positions and have gray iron depletions due to wetness."
