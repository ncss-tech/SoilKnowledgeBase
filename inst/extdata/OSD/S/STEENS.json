Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A and E horizons and very strongly acid or strongly acid in the Bt horizon.  Exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 5 to 12 percent in the Bt horizon.  Clay content in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon is 20 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3; if the chroma is less than 3.5, the thickness of the horizon is less than 6 inches.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  The texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. Some pedons have an EB or BE horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8, with common or many mottles in shades of brown or gray, and in some pedons the horizon is mottled in shades of these colors.  The texture is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, with few to many mottles in shades of brown, red, or gray.  Brown and black concretions, if present, are few to many.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam."

Series in closely related families are the Dundee, Fork, Guyton, Moten, Patterson, Quitman, Stough, Rosella, and Vimville series.  Dundee soils are fine-silty in the particle-size control section and have mixed mineralogy.  Fork soils have a mixed mineralogy.  Guyton, Rosella, and Vimville soils have a matrix with dominant chroma of 2 or less below the Ap horizon and an albic horizon that tongues into the argillic horizon; also Rosella soils have a natric horizon with more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium.  Moten and Patterson soils are coarse-loamy in the particle-size control section.  Quitman and Stough soils have less than 35 percent base saturation; also, Stough soils are coarse-loamy in the particle-size control section."
