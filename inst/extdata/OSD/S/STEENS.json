  "OVERVIEW": "The Steens series consists of somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy marine and fluvatile sediments.  These are nearly level soils on uplands and stream terraces of the Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area. The seasonal high water table is at a depth of 1.0 to 2.5 feet late in winter and early in spring.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

Clay content in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon is 20 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3; if the chroma is less than 3.5, the thickness of the horizon is less than 6 inches.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  The texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. Some pedons have an EB or BE horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8, with common or many mottles in shades of brown or gray, and in some pedons the horizon is mottled in shades of these colors.  The texture is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, with few to many mottles in shades of brown, red, or gray.  Brown and black concretions, if present, are few to many.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam."

Guyton, Rosella, and Vimville soils have a matrix with dominant chroma of 2 or less below the Ap horizon and an albic horizon that tongues into the argillic horizon; also Rosella soils have a natric horizon with more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium.  Moten and Patterson soils are coarse-loamy in the particle-size control section.
