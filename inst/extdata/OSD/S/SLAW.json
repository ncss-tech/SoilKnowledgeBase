They formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Elevations range from 1,066 to 2,010 meters. The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 130 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."
