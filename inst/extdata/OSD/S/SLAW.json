  "OVERVIEW": "The Slaw series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks. Slaw soils are on alluvial flats, flood plains, basin floors, lake plains, flood plain playas, drainageways, and low stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
