    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the peat ranges from 50 to 75 inches.  Typically, the substratum is mucky silt loam; but in areas bordering the coast sandy materials may occur.  An ashy overburden, ranging in thickness from 8 to 16 inches, occurs in northern Kodiak Island.  Lenses of ash or cinders commonly occur throughout the peat."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Saltery soils are in shallow depressions near stream estuaries and in glaciated uplands.  They are formed from deposits of sedge peat in areas of subarctic grasslands.  The climate is cool maritime.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 70 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.  Temperatures below freezing are recorded on fewer than 40 days annually, and temperatures above 70 degrees F. are rare."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Chiniak, Kizhuyak, Kodiak, and Pasagshak series.  Chiniak soils consists of gravelly beach materials with an overburden of volcanic ash.  Kizhuyak soils consists of deep alluvial deposits of fresh ash materials.  Kodiak soils have fresh volcanic ash and shallow thixotropic materials over weathered metamorphic rock or till.  Pasagshak soils consist of fresh ash and very shallow alluvial silt over gravel."
