  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Swanboy soils commonly contain carbonates throughout, but some pedons do not have carbonates.  Visible salts are within 10 inches of the surface, and the surface is dispersed and crusted.  When the soil is dry, cracks 1/2 inch to 2 inches wide and several feet long extend to depths below 20 inches.  Soil colors are mostly inherited from the parent material.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is clay or silty clay.  It ranges from neutral to strongly alkaline.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It ranges from slightly to strongly alkaline.  The horizons has gypsum in some pedons.  Some pedons have lower values but are no darker than the C horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7, 3 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  It has visible salts in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Swanboy soils are nearly level to strongly sloping, have plane to concave surfaces, and are on upland valleys, fans, flats, and stream terraces.  Gilai microrelief is in most areas.  Slope gradients typically are less than 6 percent but range from 0 to 15 percent.  They formed in dense clay alluvium.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 24 inches."

The Hisle, Kyle and Twotop soils are on similar positions and the Lismas, Orella, Pierre, Samsil, Sansarc, Wasa and Winler soils are on adjacent higher upland positions.  Hisle soils have a natric horizon.  Lismas, Orella, Samsil, and Sansarc soils have shale at a depth of less than 20 inches.  Pierre, Wasa and Winler soils have shale at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."
