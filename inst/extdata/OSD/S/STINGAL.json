  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stingal soils are on low-level and intermediate-level lake terraces that are somewhat undulating or dissected in places.  These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from calcareous sedimentary rocks such as limestone and sandstone.  In places these deposits have been reworked by wind.  Slopes are 1 to 10 percent.  Elevations range from 4,300 to 5,200 feet.  The climate is dry, subhumid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is about 70 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches.  The frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
