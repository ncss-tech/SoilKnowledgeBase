  "OVERVIEW": "The Stingal series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from limestone and sandstone.  Stingal soils are on low-level and intermediate-level lake terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from calcareous sedimentary rocks such as limestone and sandstone.  In places these deposits have been reworked by wind.  Slopes are 1 to 10 percent.  Elevations range from 4,300 to 5,200 feet.  The climate is dry, subhumid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is about 70 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches.  The frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
