Closely similar soils are Bolar, Lewisville, Nuff, Nuvalde, Quanah, Somervell, and Venus series.\nLewisville and Quanah soils: have less than 35 percent total clay in the particle-size control section.\nNuvalde and Venus soils: have less than 40 percent carbonates in the particle-size control section.\nBolar soils: are underlain by limestone at depths of 20 to 40 inches.\nNuff soils: have sola 20 to 40 inches thick over claystone and are wetter for longer periods during growing season.\nSomervell soils: contain more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section.\nGEOGRAPHIC SETTING:\nParent material: loamy and/or clayey residuum weathered from claystone of Pennsylvanian age\nLandscape: Hills\nLandform: footslopes and backslopes of ridges and escarpments on hills\nSlope: 1 to 40 percent\nMean annual precipitation: 660 to 864 mm (26 to 34 in)\nThornthwaite P-E Index: 40 to 50\nMean annual air temperature: 16.7 to 18.3 degrees C (62 to 65 degrees F)\nFrost-free period: 210 to 240 days\nElevation: 243.8 to 548.6 m (800 to 1800 ft)\nGEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hensley, Leeray, Owens, Palopinto, Thurber, and Truce series.\nHensley and Palopinto soils: occur on gently sloping limestone ridgetops.\nLeeray soils: have gilgai micro-relief and occur below on broad nearly level and gently sloping footslopes and toeslopes.\nOwens soils: have light colored surfaces, contain less calcium carbonate, and occupy positions similar to Set soils.\nThurber soils: are below along broad, nearly level to gently sloping valleys.\nTruce soils: have light colored loamy surfaces and occur on lower footslopes positions.\nDRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Set soils are well drained. Permeability is slow. Runoff is high on 1 to 5 percent slopes and very high on slopes greater than 5 percent.\nUSE AND VEGETATION: Used for rangeland, but a few small gently sloping areas are cultivated to small grain or forage sorghum. Native grasses consist of sideoats grama, little bluestem, silver bluestem, buffalograss, and Texas needlegrass. Forbs include Maximilian sunflower, Engelmann-daisy, dalea species, and western ragweed. Sumac species, oak, elm, and whitebrush also occur.\nDISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North-central Texas; LRR H - Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region, MLRA 80B - Texas north-central prairies; The series is of moderate extent.\nMLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas\nSERIES ESTABLISHED: Palo Pinto County, Texas; 1979.\nREMARKS:\nEdited 01/2017 (RFG-SCP): Converted to tabular format and added metric units.
