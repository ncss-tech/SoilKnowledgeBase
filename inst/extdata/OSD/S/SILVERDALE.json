  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The sandy sediments typically range from 24 to 39 inches thick. The loamy alluvium ranges from 16 to 36 inches thick.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Typically it is loamy sand but can be fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or sandy loam. The A horizon ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4 and mottles with value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or it has matrix color with chroma of 2 or less with brownish mottles. It is fine sand, sand, or coarse sand. It ranges from medium acid to neutral. Some pedons have thin layers and pockets of concretions and oxides (FeMn) in the lower part of the horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam. In some pedons the upper part has a darker colored buried horizon with value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. It commonly is slightly acid but ranges from medium acid to neutral. Mottles have value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sand or loamy sand. It is slightly acid or neutral."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Similar soils are the Canalou, Crevasse, and Steele series. Canalou soils contain more silt and clay in the upper part of the control section and contain more sand in the lower part of the control section. Crevasse soils are sandy throughout the control section. Steele soils have clayey textures at depths of 20 to 36 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Silverdale soils are nearly level and in slightly concave micro depressions on natural levees in the upper part of the Mississippi River Delta. The soils formed in sandy sediments and loamy alluvium. Mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 65 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 55 inches."

All of these soils contain more silt and clay in the upper part of the solum than Silverdale. Cairo, Gideon, Roellen, and Sikeston are in the concave natural drains in nearby landscapes. Dubbs and Dundee soils are on natural levees bordering former channels."
