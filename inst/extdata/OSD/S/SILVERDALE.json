  "REVDATE": "06/2007",
  "STATES": "MS,MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Silverdale series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 24 to 39 inches of sandy sediments over loamy alluvium. These soils are in slightly concave micro depressions on natural levees. These soils have rapid permeability in the upper part and moderate permeability in the lower part. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The sandy sediments typically range from 24 to 39 inches thick. The loamy alluvium ranges from 16 to 36 inches thick.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Typically it is loamy sand but can be fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or sandy loam. The A horizon ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4 and mottles with value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or it has matrix color with chroma of 2 or less with brownish mottles. It is fine sand, sand, or coarse sand. It ranges from medium acid to neutral. Some pedons have thin layers and pockets of concretions and oxides (FeMn) in the lower part of the horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam. In some pedons the upper part has a darker colored buried horizon with value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. It commonly is slightly acid but ranges from medium acid to neutral. Mottles have value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sand or loamy sand. It is slightly acid or neutral."

Canalou soils contain more silt and clay in the upper part of the control section and contain more sand in the lower part of the control section. Crevasse soils are sandy throughout the control section. Steele soils have clayey textures at depths of 20 to 36 inches."
