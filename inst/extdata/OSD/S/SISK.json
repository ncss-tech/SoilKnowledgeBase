Stones and boulders cover from 0 to 15 percent of the surface. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout.\nThe O horizons have hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe A horizon, when present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak or moderate, very fine or fine granular structure.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, with value and chroma of 2 or 3. The Bh horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value and chroma of 2 to 3. The Bh and Bhs horizons are silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.

The soils formed in dense till. The mean annual temperature ranges from 0 to 6 degrees C and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 102 to 152 centimeters. The frost-free season ranges from 30 to 90 days. Elevations range from 700 to 1600 meters above mean sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are principally the Bemis, Saddleback and Surplus soils, but also the Enchanted, Mahoosuc and Ricker soils. Bemis soils are on concave positions in the nearby landscape. Saddleback soils are shallow to bedrock and on convex positions. Surplus soils are moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained and typically are on gentler slopes than Sisk soils, or are on concave positions. Enchanted soils are typically on smooth steeper slopes and have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Mahoosuc soils are organic soils overlying rubble on the nearby landscape. Ricker soils are thin organic soils over bedrock on convex positions."
