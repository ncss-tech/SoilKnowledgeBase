  "OVERVIEW": "The Sisk series consists of very deep, well drained soils on side slopes of mountain ridges. These soils formed in dense glacial till. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the organic surface layer and the mineral solum and low to moderately high in the substratum. Mean annual temperature is about 1 degree C and mean annual precipitation is about 127 centimeters at the type location.",

Bemis soils are on concave positions in the nearby landscape. Saddleback soils are shallow to bedrock and on convex positions. Surplus soils are moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained and typically are on gentler slopes than Sisk soils, or are on concave positions. Enchanted soils are typically on smooth steeper slopes and have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Mahoosuc soils are organic soils overlying rubble on the nearby landscape. Ricker soils are thin organic soils over bedrock on convex positions."
