  "OVERVIEW": "The Syrupcreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on ridgetops and side slopes of mountains and plateaus.  Syrupcreek soils formed in ash and loess over colluvium and residuum derived from basalt and andesitic brecias.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
