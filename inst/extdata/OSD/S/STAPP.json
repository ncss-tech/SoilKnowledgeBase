  "OVERVIEW": "The Stapp series consists of deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable upland soils that formed in material weathered from shale of Pennsylvanian age.  These soils occur on gently sloping to strongly sloping forested uplands of the Ouachita Mountains, MLRA 119.  The lower solum is saturated during late winter and early spring.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 46 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F.",

Soils in similar families are the Bengal, Carnasaw, Enders, and Endsaw series.  All of these soils except Bengal, Carnasaw, Enders, Endsaw, Helena, Lignum, Rosewall, and Vinita have bedrock at depths greater than\n60 inches.  Bengal and Vinita soils have solum 20 to 40 inches thick over bedrock.  Carnasaw, Enders, and Endsaw soils are not saturated with water in the mottled zone that have moist value of 4 or more and moist chroma of 2 or less.  Helena soils have a contact with granitic rock.  Lignum soils have a contact with mica schist and contain mica within the solum.  Rosewall soils have more than 60 percent clay content in the upper B2t horizon."
