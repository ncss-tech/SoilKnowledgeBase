    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Annemaine, Beason, Craven, Creedmore, Dogue, Eulonia, Helena, Lignum, Nemours, Newco, Rosenwall, Sacul, Vinita, and Wolftever series in the same family.  Soils in similar families are the Bengal, Carnasaw, Enders, and Endsaw series.  All of these soils except Bengal, Carnasaw, Enders, Endsaw, Helena, Lignum, Rosewall, and Vinita have bedrock at depths greater than\n60 inches.  Bengal and Vinita soils have solum 20 to 40 inches thick over bedrock.  Carnasaw, Enders, and Endsaw soils are not saturated with water in the mottled zone that have moist value of 4 or more and moist chroma of 2 or less.  Helena soils have a contact with granitic rock.  Lignum soils have a contact with mica schist and contain mica within the solum.  Rosewall soils have more than 60 percent clay content in the upper B2t horizon."
