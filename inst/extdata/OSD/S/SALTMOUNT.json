  "STATES": "CA,NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Saltmount series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over lacustrine deposits.  Saltmount soils are on parna dunes and dissected lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
