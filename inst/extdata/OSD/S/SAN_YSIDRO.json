  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is about 60 degrees to 65 degrees F.  The soil is usually moist in some or all parts between depths of 5 and 15 inches from late November or early December until May.  The soil usually is dry all the rest of the time.\nThe Ap horizon is light brownish gray or pale brown in 10YR hue.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  This horizon is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon is up to 6 inches thick and is present in some pedons or there is a thin layer of bleached grains just above the Bt horizon.  Fine yellowish or brownish mottles are present in some pedons in part of the Ap horizon and A horizon where present.\nThe upper Bt horizon is brown, light brown, very pale brown, yellowish brown, dark yellowish brown, light yellowish brown or brownish yellow in hue 10YR or 7.5YR.  It is heavy clay loam or clay and has about 35 to 45 percent clay in at least the upper part and moderate to strong angular blocky structure in the lower part.  Some pedons have columnar structure.  The Bt horizon is slightly acid to moderately alkaline and increases in alkalinity with increasing depth.  Exchangeable sodium is less than 15 percent.\nThe lower Bt horizon is pale brown, light yellowish or yellowish brown.  It is somewhat stratified and ranges from sandy loam to silty clay loam.  This horizon is slightly or moderately alkaline and has small amounts of segregated lime in some pedons."

They formed in alluvium from sedimentary rocks.  The climate is dry subhumid mesothermic with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 25 inches, average January temperature is about 46 degrees F., and average July temperature is about 76 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 58 degrees to 60 degrees F.  Average frost-free season is 200 to 300 days."
