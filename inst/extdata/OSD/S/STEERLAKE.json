  "OVERVIEW": "The Steerlake series consists of deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Steerlake soils are on alluvial fans and landslides.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C.",
