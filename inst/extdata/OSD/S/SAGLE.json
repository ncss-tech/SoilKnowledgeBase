  "OVERVIEW": "The Sagle series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in glacial till with a mantle of volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately rapid in the substratum. These soils are on uplands and have slopes ranging from 5 to 30 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and  average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The  soils formed in glacial till with a mantle of volcanic ash. Average  annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F; average annual  precipitation ranges from 28 to 35 inches.
