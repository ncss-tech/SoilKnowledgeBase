  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sagle soils are on uplands that have a plane or  concave surface. They occur in bowl-like areas below steeper mountains  from which they receive excess runoff and seepage. Elevations range  from 2,200 to 3,000 feet. The slope range is 5 to 30 percent. The  soils formed in glacial till with a mantle of volcanic ash. Average  annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F; average annual  precipitation ranges from 28 to 35 inches. The frost-free season is  about 90 to 120 days."

Pend Oreille soils  are well drained and have less than 35 percent coarse fragments above  40 inches. Treble soils are well drained and lack a volcanic ash  mantle. Hoodoo soils are poorly drained."
