    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to free carbonates ranges from 28 to 50 inches. The organic mantle is typically herbaceous. The solum and underlying material do not have rock fragments.\nThe O horizon in the rubbed condition has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 2. It is muck (sapric material) or mucky peat (hemic material). It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1. It is silt loam, silty clay loam, mucky silt loam or mucky silty clay loam. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bg horizon has a hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 0 to 2. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. Some pedons have thin strata of very fine sandy loam to fine sand. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Sax soils have concave or plane surfaces in shallow depressions or drainageways on glacial lake plains. They formed in a thin layer of organic material and underlying silty lacustrine sediments. Slopes are usually less than 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 43 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 30 inches. Frost-free days range from 88 to 135. Elevation above sea level ranges from 1100 to 1600 feet."

The moderately well drained Baudette soils, somewhat poorly drained Littleswan and the poorly drained Spooner soils are on higher landscape positions and are in a hydrosequence with Sax soil. The very poorly drained Cathro soils are in slightly deeper depressions and have organic materials 16 to 51 inches thick."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. Runoff is neglible or low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate. Depth to apparent seasonal high saturation is at the surface some time from April through July and October through November in normal years.  This soil is also subject to ponding during periods of snowmelt or heavy rainfall."
