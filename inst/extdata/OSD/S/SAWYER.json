  "OVERVIEW": "The Sawyer series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and clayey marine sediments of Tertiary age. These soils are on uplands of the Western and Southern Coastal Plains.  Slopes are dominantly 1 to 8 percent but range to 25 percent.",
