    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Exum and Felker series in the same family.  Exum soils contain plinthite nodules and are moderately slowly permeable.  Felker soils commonly have pockets and streaks of uncoated sand grains and less than 30 percent clay in the argillic horizon, and are somewhat poorly drained."

Harleston soils, which occur on lower sideslope positions, have a coarse-loamy control section and moderate permeability.  Sacul soils, which are on adjacent sideslopes are in a clayey particle size class.  Smithdale soils, which are on adjacent similar landscapes, are in a fine-loamy particle size class and are well drained.  Savannah soils, which are on broad gently sloping area have a fine-loamy control section and a fragipan.  Warnock soils, which occurs on similar landscapes have a fine-loamy control section and moderate permeability."
