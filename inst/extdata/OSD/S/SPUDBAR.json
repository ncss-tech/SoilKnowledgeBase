  "OVERVIEW": "The Spudbar series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or slope alluvium over residuum derived from mixed rock sources. These soils are on cuestas, hills and ridges. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
