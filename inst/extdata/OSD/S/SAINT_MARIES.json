  "OVERVIEW": "The Saint Maries series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains. They formed in material weathered from metasedimentary colluvium and residuum, dominantly siltite and fine grained quartzite with an influence of volcanic ash and loess. Permeability is moderate. Slopes range from 35 to 70 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.",
