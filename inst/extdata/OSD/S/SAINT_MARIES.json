    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Saint Maries soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 35 to 70 percent. The soils formed in material weathered from metasedimentary colluvium and residuum from the Striped Peak Formation, dominantly siltite and fine grained quartzite, with an influence of volcanic ash and loess. Elevation is 2,200 to 4,400 feet. The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 35 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."
