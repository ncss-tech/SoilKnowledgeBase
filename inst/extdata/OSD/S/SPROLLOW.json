  "OVERVIEW": "The Sprollow series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and alluvium of limestone with some loess influence.  They are on ridges, hillsides, and mountainsides.  Permeability is moderate.  Sprollow soils have slopes of 5 to 70 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
