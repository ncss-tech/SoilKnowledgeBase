    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in the same family. The Elysian, Hicota, Leverett, Messer, Timpson, and Waymor series are in closely related families. Elysian, Hicota and Timpson soils have a coarse-loamy control section. In addition, Elysian soils have a glossic horizon less than 20 inches thick. Timpson soils have are saturated within a depth of 40 inches for more than 30 cumulative days in normal years. Hicota soils have a reddish subsoil. Leverett and Messer soils have a coarse-silty control section. Waymor soils have mixed mineralogy."

They typically are at elevations about 25 to 100 feet above present flood plains. The surface is mounded and evidently has been reworked by wind. The soil formed in loamy Pliestocene age marine or alluvial sediments over a Tertiary age clayey discontinuity that is at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Sawtown soils are typically on mounds and are mapped in complex with other soils that are on intermound positions. Mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 67 degree F. The growing season or frost free period is 235 to 250 days. Average annual precipitation is 40 to 46 inches. Elevation ranges from 280 to 440 feet above sea level. The Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 66 to 80 ."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly considered a clayey substratum phase of the Bernaldo series. The type location pedon was moved from Angelina County to Rusk County and the particle-size family was changed from fine-silty to fine-loamy in an earlier revision. Data from several pedons in Rusk and Angelina Counties support a fine-loamy classification. The Keithville and Sawtown series were correlated as taxadjuncts in Angelina County because they are fine-loamy. Therefore, the classification of the Sawtown series was changed to a fine-loamy Glossudalf rather than a fine-silty Paleudalf based on a newer definition of the glossic horizon. This was discussed with Louisiana, and they agreed. The fine-silty Keithville and Metcalf series will be used in Shelby and Sabine Counties on the Sabine River Terrace. (Oct.1991). The series was assigned to an active activity class in 1999.  The depth to the saturated layers was changed from 3.5-5.0 feet to 3.0-4.5 feet in 2002 based on piezometer data and field observations.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the type location pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 23 inches (A and E horizons).\nArgillic horizon - 23 to 80 inches (Bt and 2Btg/E horizon)s.\nGlossic horizon - 49 to 80 inches (2Btg/E horizon).\nLithologic discontinuity - 49 inches (2Btg/E horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: TAMU data to be collected\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
