  "OVERVIEW": "The Singletree series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basic igneous rocks with a component of loess high in volcanic ash.  Singletree soils are on mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
