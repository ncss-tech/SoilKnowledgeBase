  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to strongly cemented or indurated, fractured limestone bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Coarse fragments range from 5 to 30 percent by volume in the control section. Coarse fragments are coated with hardened calcium carbonate. A thin coating of calcium carbonate is on the bedrock and commonly seals fractures. Calcium carbonate equivalent of the control section ranges from 40 to 60 percent. Silicate clay content of the control section ranges from 25 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loam or clay loam.\nCoarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is gravelly loam,\ngravelly clay loam or cobbly clay loam. Coarse fragments range from 10 to 25 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent\ncobbles. It is calcareous and slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe R layer is fractured strongly cemented or indurated limestone bedrock that is grayish or brownish in color."

Bolar, Carbengle, Sunev and Topsey soils are dry in the moisture\ncontrol section for less than 120 cumulative days. In addition, Carbengle, Sunev and Topsey soils do not have a\nlithic contact within 40 inches. Doss soils are shallow to a paralithic contact. Set soils have fine-silty control\nsections. Somervell soils are skeletal."

The regolith is loamy materials between fractured beds of indurated limestone of the Permian System. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 25 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 68 degrees F. Frost free days range from 210 to 230 days, and elevation ranges from 1,350 to 1,700 feet. Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 32 to 44."
