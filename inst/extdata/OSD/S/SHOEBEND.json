  "OVERVIEW": "The Shoebend series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks. Slopes range form 25 to 65 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

Bissell, Cowiche, Fernpoint, Hullsgulch, Jerusalem, Margerum, Orr, Quailridge, Ralls, Springmeyer, Truax and Wenatchee soils are more than 40 inches deep. Bjork, Dodes, Noslo, Pahrange and Uhaldi soils do not have a lithic contact. Indiano soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments of volcanic origin in the particle-size control section and are 20 to 40 inches to lithic volcanic bedrock, including rhyolite. Madras soils have secondary carbonates in a 2Crk horizon and 10 to 30 percent volcanic glass within the mollic epipedon. Quiero and Simcoe soils do not have Cr horizons, have rock fragments of volcanic origin, when present, and are 20 to 40 inches to lithic volcanic bedrock."
