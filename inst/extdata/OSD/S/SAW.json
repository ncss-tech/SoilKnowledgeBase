  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 19 to 33 inches.  Depth to hard bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid unless limed.  Limed soils are typically moderately acid to neutral in the A and E horizons, and very strongly acid to slightly acid in the BA, BE, and Bt horizons.  Rock fragments, dominantly of gravel size, range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in the A, Ap, or C horizons, and from 0 to 15 percent by volume in the E, BE, BA, Bt, and BC horizons.  Content of feldspar crystals ranges from none to common in the upper part and from none to many in the lower part.  Content of mica flakes ranges from few to common in the A, Ap, E, BE, BA, and Bt horizons and from few to many in the BC and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  In areas not significantly affected by erosion, it is sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  In eroded areas, texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have an E horizon that has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a BE or BA horizon that has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  In some pedons, part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  The Bt horizon is clay, sandy clay, or clay loam.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon that has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a C horizon that is similar in color to the BC horizon, or is multicolored.  It is sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe R horizon is hard felsic igneous bedrock such as porphyritic granite or granite.  Some pedons have a thin Cr horizon of soft weathered felsic igneous rock which overlies the R horizon."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Appling, Bethlehem, Cecil, Madison, Nankin, Pacolet, Tumbleton and Wedowee series in the same family.  None of these soils except Bethlehem have bedrock within depths of 20 to 40 inches.  In addition they typically have thicker Bt horizons.  Bethlehem soils have soft weathered bedrock instead of hard bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches, and formed from sillimanite schist and phyllite schist.   Tumbleton soils formed in coastal plain sediments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Saw soils are on gently sloping to steep ridges and side slopes in the Piedmont uplands.  Slope ranges from 2 to 45 percent, and is commonly 2 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in residuum weathered from felsic igneous rocks such as porphyritic granite or granite.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 59 to 62 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 39 to 49 inches."

Except for Ashlar soils, none of these soils have bedrock within depths of 20 to 40 inches, and except for Wake soils, they typically have thicker Bt horizons.  Ashlar soils have a cambic horizon and are in a coarse-loamy family.  Helena soils are moderately well drained, Rion soils are in a fine-loamy family, and Vance soils are in a mixed mineralogy family.  Wake soils have hard bedrock within depths of 8 to 20 inches.  All of these soils except Helena are on ridges and side slopes.  Helena soils are on toe slopes and around the heads of drainageways."
