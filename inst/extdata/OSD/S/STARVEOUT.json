  "OVERVIEW": "The Starveout series consist of very deep, well drained soils that are formed in alluvium from loess and basalt.  They are on canyon and drainage sides and have slopes of 3 to 45 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.  and the average annual precipitation is about 18 inches.",
