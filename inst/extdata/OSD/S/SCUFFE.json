  "OVERVIEW": "The Scuffe series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks.  Scuffe soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
