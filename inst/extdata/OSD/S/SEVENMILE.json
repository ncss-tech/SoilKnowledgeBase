  "OVERVIEW": "The Sevenmile series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff with minor components of limestone and quartzite. Sevenmile soils are on stream terraces, drainageways, and inset fans. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",

    "content": "REMARKS: This revision updates the taxonomic classification from Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haploxerolls.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 43 cm (A1, A2, and Bw1 horizons).\nVitritorrandic feature - The zone from the soil surface to 43 cm (A1, A2, and Bw1 horizons).\nCambic horizon - The zone from 43 to 86 cm (Bw2 horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bw2 horizon and parts of the Bw1 and C1 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: The typical pedon at the series type location was sampled for full characterization by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S92nv-023-006 (pedon # 92P0575). The 10/2009 update changed the classification from isotic to mixed, superactive to better reflect the series concept.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
