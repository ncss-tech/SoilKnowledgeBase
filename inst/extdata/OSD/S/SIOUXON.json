  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to a lithic contact is 40 to 60 inches.  The particle-size control section contains from 50 to 80 percent hard rock fragments, dominantly cobbles.  Most fragments are angular or subangular and of local origin, but some rounded gravel and cobbles are in some pedons at lower elevations on slopes adjacent to glaciated valleys.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Pebbles range from 15 to 30 percent and cobbles from 20 to 30 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  Texture is very cobbly loam, extremely cobbly loam, very cobbly silt loam, or extremely cobbly silt loam.  Pebbles range from 15 to 40 percent and cobbles from 15 to 55 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  Texture is extremely cobbly loam or extremely cobbly silt loam.  Pebbles range from 15 to 30 percent and cobbles from 45 to 65 percent."

Putt soils have an umbric epipedon more than 20 inches thick and are weakly cemented below 20 to 30 inches.   Schneider soils have an umbric epipedon 20 to 30 inches thick.  Delphi soils have 35 to 70 percent rounded rock fragments, dominantly pebbles in the particle-size control section. Guler soils have a mean annual temperature of 47 to 50 degrees F, and are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days.  McCarthy soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  McElroy soils are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days.  Washougal soils have an umbric epipedon more than 20 inches thick and have a 2C horizon at a depth of 24 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Siouxon soils are on mountainsides and ridgetops at elevations of 300 to 1,800 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 90 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from volcanic ash and basic igneous rock, including andesite, andesitic volcanic breccia, and plagioclase or olivine basalt.  On slopes adjacent to the glaciated valleys of the Green, Toutle, Coweeman, Kalama, and Lewis Rivers, Siouxon soils are influenced by alpine ablation till.  The climate is marine and characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual air temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 175 to 200 days.  The average annual precipitation is 60 to 80 inches."

Baumgard, Govar and Wilkeson soils are fine-loamy, and Wilkeson soils have an argillic horizon.  Cinebar, Mulholland, and Newaukum soils are medial.  Pheeney soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact and are frigid.  Xeno soils are frigid and fine-loamy."
