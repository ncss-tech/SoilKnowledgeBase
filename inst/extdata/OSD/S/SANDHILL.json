  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to weathered rippable bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Reaction in each horizon is medium acid or strongly acid. The content of soft rock fragments ranges from about 15 percent to 35 percent in the A and B horizons and up to 65 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some severely eroded pedons also have chroma of 6.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is loam or  silt loam except some severely eroded areas are also clay loam or silty clay loam.\nMost pedons have a transitional horizon between the A or E horizon and Bt horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  In most pedons, the lower part of the Bt horizon contains few to many mottles in shades of brown, yellow, and red.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is clay loam, silty clay loam or loam.  Some pedons contain thin subhorizons of silty clay or clay.\nThe C or BC horizon has the same colors as the Bt horizon except, in some pedons, it is mottled with no distinct matrix color.  Textures of the fine earth fraction are the same as the Bt horizon.\nThe Cr horizon consist of soft interbedded siltstone, fine grained sandstone, and shale and a few thin strata of hard limestone.  It can be dug with a spade except for the hard strata."

Bolivar soils have a paralithic contact between 20 and 40 inches.  Liddieville, Pamunkey and Toine soils formed in alluvium on stream terraces and are greater than 60 inches to bedrock.  Stiversville soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the solum.  Armour soils are fine-silty, are formed in alluvium, and are greater than 60 inches to bedrock.  Culleoka soils have a mesic soil temperature regime.  Hicks soils are fine-silty and have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the solum."
