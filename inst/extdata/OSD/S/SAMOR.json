  "OVERVIEW": "The Samor series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone.  Samor soils occur on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
