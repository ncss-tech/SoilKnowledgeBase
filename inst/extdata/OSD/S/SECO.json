  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Seco series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from basalt. Seco soils are on valley floors and edges of playas. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
