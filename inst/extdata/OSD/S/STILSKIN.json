  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depths to weathered bedrock ranges from 12 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is loam or fine sandy loam.  Coarse fragments content ranges from 15 to 35 percent, including 5 to 15 percent more than 3 inches across. Reaction is moderately alkaline.  Surface coverage by sandstone and limestone fragments ranges from about 35 to 85 percent.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Films and threads of calcium carbonate are common to many.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 40 to 55 percent.  Platy sandstone fragments 1/4 to 4 inches thick and 1/2 to 6 inches across comprise 35 to 85 percent by volume, including 15 to 30 percent more than 3 inches across.\nThe Cr layer consists of platy, calcareous sandstone 1/4 to 4 inches thick and 1/2 to 6 inches across.  Brownish, yellowish, or pinkish, loamy calcareous earth in the interstices comprises up to 10 percent of the upper few inches, but decreases rapidly with depth. Hardness is less than 3 Moh's scale."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  Similar soils are the Brackett, Cho, Comfort, Hext, Karnes, Quinlan, Talpa, Tarpley, and Whitewright series.  All these soils except Comfort contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  In addition, Brackett soils are underlain by interbedded limestone; Cho soils have a petrocalcic horizon; Comfort and Tarpley soils are more clayey and have an argillic horizon; Hext soils have less than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent and are moderately deep to sandstone or sandy marl; Karnes soils are more than 20 inches deep; Quinlan soils developed over redbeds and have B horizons that are 5YR or redder.  Talpa soils are underlain by indurated limestone at depths of 14 inches or less; and Whitewright soils are more clayey and developed in platy chalky materials."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These moderately steep to steep soils are on hillsides and scarps 100 to 400 yards wide and several miles long.  They border undulating to gently rolling limestone plateaus near the Central Basin MLRA.  Slopes range from 12 to 40 percent. The soil formed in residuum weathered from platy calcareous sandstone.  The climate is dry subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 34 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 67 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 210 to 240 days and elevation range from 1,300 to 1,900 feet.   Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 38 to 44."
