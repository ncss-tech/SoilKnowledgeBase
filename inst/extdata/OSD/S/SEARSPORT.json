  "OVERVIEW": "The Searsport series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in thick sandy deposits in pockets and depressions on outwash plains, deltas, and terraces. Estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the mineral horizons. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 41 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F. at type location.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Gravel, by volume, ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the particle-size control section and from 0 to 45 percent below. The soil ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the O, A, and E horizon and from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the C horizon.\nThe Oe horizon is neutral or has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. Some pedons have an Oa and/or an Oi horizon. Oi horizons have higher value and chroma.  Combined thickness of O horizons is 8 to 16 inches.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam or their mucky analogues. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium, granular or subangular blocky, or the horizon is single grain.\nSome pedons have an Eg horizon that is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 or 1. It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Cg horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 4. Chroma of 3 or 4 is generally below a depth of 30 inches. Redoximorphic features are faint to prominent, few to many, and fine to coarse, or may be absent. The C horizon is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, sand or coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction and some pedons are stratified."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ausable, Deerwood, Leafriver, and Tahawus series. Ausable, Deerwood, and Leafriver soils are from outside of Region R. Ausable soils have thin bands of organic material in the control section. Deerwood soils have free carbonates in the control section. Leafriver soils have a drier climate. Tahawus soils formed in till and are less acid than Searsport soils."

These soils formed in thick sandy deposits. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 46 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 50 inches. The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 5 to 3000 feet above sea level."
