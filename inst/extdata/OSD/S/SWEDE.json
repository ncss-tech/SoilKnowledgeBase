  "OVERVIEW": "The Swede series consists of deep or very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvial material from basaltic and granitic sources. Swede soils are on alluvial fans and colluvial footslopes and have slopes of 1 to 60 percent. Permeability is moderately slow. The average annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
