  "OVERVIEW": "The SHURTLEFF series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from interbedded, calcareous sedimentary rocks. These soils are on hillslopes. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.",
