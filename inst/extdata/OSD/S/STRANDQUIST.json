The moderately well drained Foxhome and Pelan soils formed in material similar to that of the Strandquist soils and are on higher convex positions. The Kratka soils are in similar landscape positions and have less gravel in the upper mantle.  The well drained Sandberg and moderately well drained Radium soils are on higher positions. The Mavie and Percy soils have a calcic horizon within 16 inches of the surface. The excessively drained Sioux soils are on higher convex positions."
