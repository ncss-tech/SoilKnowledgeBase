    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 14 inches. Free carbonates are within depths of 10 inches or less. The thickness of the water-sorted upper sediment ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The average content of rock fragments in the upper sediment below depths of 10 inches ranges from 35 to 75 percent. The content of rock fragments in the till ranges from 2 to 15 percent. The rock fragments are mixed in lithology.\nThe Ap or A horizon has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture in the fine earth fraction typically is coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, or loamy sand, but thin layers of fine sand are in a few pedons. It is slightly or moderately alkaline, and its calcium carbonate equivalent is 5 to 15 percent.\nThe 3BCg horizon in the Percy till phase have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  It has 12 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine and coarser sand. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 20 to 40 percent.\nThe 3BCdg horizons in the Percy till phase have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  It has 12 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine and coarser sand. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 20 to 40 percent.  Moist bulk density ranges from 1.70 to 1.85 g/cc.\nThe 3Cdg horizons in the Percy till phase have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Chroma of 3 may be present in the lower, denser portion of the horizon (3Cdg).  This color may also occur on ped interiors with lower chroma occurring on exteriors and along fracture faces.  It has textures of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  It has 12 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine and coarser sand. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 20 to 40 percent.  Moist bulk density ranges from 1.75 to 2.00 g/cc.\nThe 3BCg and 3Cg horizons in the Des Moines till phase have a matrix with hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils have plane or slightly concave slopes ranging from 0 to 2 percent on lake plains. They formed primarily in 20 to 40 inches of loamy and sandy water-sorted sediments overlying loamy, glacial till. These materials are Late Wisconsinan in age. The mean annual air temperature is 36 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 19 to 28 inches. Frost-free days range from 88 to 135. Elevation above sea level ranges from 750 to 1,350 feet."

The moderately well drained Foxhome and Pelan soils formed in material similar to that of the Strandquist soils and are on higher convex positions. The Kratka soils are in similar landscape positions and have less gravel in the upper mantle.  The well drained Sandberg and moderately well drained Radium soils are on higher positions. The Mavie and Percy soils have a calcic horizon within 16 inches of the surface. The excessively drained Sioux soils are on higher convex positions."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity, measured in inches per hour, is 6 to 20 in the upper sediment and .06 to .6 in the underlying till. When not drained, depth to an apparent seasonal high water table is as high as .5 to 1.5 feet at some time from April through June in normal years."
