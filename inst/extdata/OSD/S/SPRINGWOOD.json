  "STATES": "MD,VA",
  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Springwood series are very deep, well drained, and have moderately slow permeability.  They formed in residuum from calcareous conglomerate in the Triassic Basin of the Piedmont Plateau.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",
