  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to hard calcareous conglomerate bedrock is greater than 60 inches.   Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent in the A, Ap, AB, BA, Bt, and BCt horizons, and 0 to 40 percent in the C horizon.  Reaction is very strongly acid through neutral.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 8.  It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe AB or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BCt horizon, where present, has hue of 10R through 10YR, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, commonly has hue of 10R through 10YR, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 4 through 8; but colors are often variegated.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay in the fine-earth fraction."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Springwood soils are on gently sloping to strongly sloping broad ridge summits, shoulders, and backslopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent, but are dominantly 3 to 9 percent.  The soils formed in residuum from calcareous conglomerate.  Sinkholes are common.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 50 to 55 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches."

Lucketts soils are on adjacent footslopes and have rock fragments of quartzite and greenstone indicative of the colluvial capping present.  Morven soils are in concave positions with rock fragments indicative of colluvial and alluvial parent materials throughout.  Scattersville soils are in drainageways and have more than 50 percent redox depletions in the subsoil.  Braddock and Wintergreen soils are on adjacent backslopes and formed in colluvium of crystalline rock."
