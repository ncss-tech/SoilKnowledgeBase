    "content": "TYPE LOCATION:  Anderson County, Tennessee; 3.5 miles south of Oak Ridge Animal Research Laboratory on Bethel Valley Road; West on\nWeis Road, .25 mile; 300 feet east of Weis Road under power line.\nRange In Characteristics:  Solum thickness and depth to rippable bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from\nstrongly acid to neutral in the A horizon and from medium acid to mildly alkaline in the B horizon.  Coarse fragments of shale range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in the A horizon, from 0 to 35\npercent by volume in the B2t horizon and from 10 to 60 percent by volume in the B3 horizon.  Fragments of shale dominantly are 1 to\n3 inches in size but range from 1 to 6 inches.  Sand content is\nless than 10 percent in the control section.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 5 and chroma of 3 through 4.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay\nor silt loam.  The A1 horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR,\nvalue of 4 or 3 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam or\nsilty clay loam.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma 4 or 6.  Texture is clay or silty clay or their shaly analogues.  Some pedons have a B1 horizon with color similar to\nthe above.  Texture is mainly silty clay and clay but the range includes silty clay loam and silt loam.\nThe B3 horizon has hue of 5YR, 2.5YR or 10R, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 6.  Texture is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam or their shaly or very shaly analogues.\nSome pedons have a C horizon with color and texture similar to the\nB3 horizon."

These soils formed in material weathered from calcareous shale or siltstone with seams\nof hard shaly limestone in a few places.  Near the type location average annual air temperature is about 57 degrees F.  Average\nannual rainfall is about 54 inches."
