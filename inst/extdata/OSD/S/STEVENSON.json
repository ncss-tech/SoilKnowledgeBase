  "OVERVIEW": "The Stevenson series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in landslide material from basalt, andesite and conglomerate.  Stevenson soils are on toe slopes and backslopes of uplands.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
