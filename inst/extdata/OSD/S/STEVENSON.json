They formed in colluvial material from basalt, andesite and conglomerate.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and wet.  The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 85 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 27 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 150 days."
