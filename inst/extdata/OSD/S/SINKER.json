  "OVERVIEW": "The Sinker series consists of moderately deep, well drained\nsoils on hills.  They formed in colluvium derived dominantly\nfrom schist and graywacke.  Slopes are 12 to 80 percent.\nThe mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the\nmean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
