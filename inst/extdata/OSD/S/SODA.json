These soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice over glacial till.  They are in a climate with warm dry summers and cold moist  winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 65 to 110 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 38 to 43 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F, is about 95 to 150 days."
