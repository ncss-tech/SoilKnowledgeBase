  "REVDATE": "11/2002",
  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Stainky series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in an admixture of loess and silty glacial outwash underlain by friable to firm very gravelly glacial till.   Stainky soils are on glacial till plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches.",

The upper part of the particle-size control  section is an admixture of loess and glacial outwash material 18 to 37 inches thick and averages 5 to 25 percent rock fragments.  The lower part of the control section is loamy-skeletal and averages 35 to 50 percent rock fragments.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum and moderately acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe E and Eb horizons have moist value of 4 or 5 and moist chroma from 1 through 3.\nThe Bs and Bsb horizons have moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, moist value of 3 or 4 and moist chroma of 4 through 6.  Textures include silt loam and loam with 0 to 10 percent cobble and 5 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe BC and C horizons have moist hue from 7.5YR to 2.5Y, moist value from 3 to 5 and moist chroma from 3 to 6.  Textures include silt loam and loam with 0 to 10 percent cobble and 5 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe 2C horizons have moist hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, moist value of 3 or 4 and moist chroma from 2 through 4.
