    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  MAST ranges from 33 to 36 degrees F. Some profiles may be bisequal.  The upper solum ranges in thickness from 6 to 15 inches. The upper part of the particle-size control  section is an admixture of loess and glacial outwash material 18 to 37 inches thick and averages 5 to 25 percent rock fragments.  The lower part of the control section is loamy-skeletal and averages 35 to 50 percent rock fragments.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum and moderately acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe E and Eb horizons have moist value of 4 or 5 and moist chroma from 1 through 3.\nThe Bs and Bsb horizons have moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, moist value of 3 or 4 and moist chroma of 4 through 6.  Textures include silt loam and loam with 0 to 10 percent cobble and 5 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe BC and C horizons have moist hue from 7.5YR to 2.5Y, moist value from 3 to 5 and moist chroma from 3 to 6.  Textures include silt loam and loam with 0 to 10 percent cobble and 5 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe 2C horizons have moist hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, moist value of 3 or 4 and moist chroma from 2 through 4.  Textures include sandy loam and loam.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 5 percent stone, 0 to 20 percent cobble and 25 to 45 percent gravel."

Flat Horn soils are dominated by amorphous material in the solum and are stratified in the substratum.  Hartnit and Oso soils are 20 to 40 inches deep over bedrock.  Timberly soils have A horizons. Yohn soils have strata of fine sand and silt."
