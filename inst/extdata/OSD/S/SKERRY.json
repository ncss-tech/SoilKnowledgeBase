  "OVERVIEW": "The Skerry series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in a loamy mantle overlying dense, sandy till on drumlins and glaciated uplands. They are moderately deep to a densic contact. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the mineral solum and moderately low or moderately high in the dense substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1175 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Mineral solum thickness and depth to densic materials ranges from 51 to 96 cm. Rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent in the solum and from 5 to 40 percent in the substratum. Unless limed, reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the solum and very strongly acid to neutral in the substratum. Weak cementation (ortstein) ranges from 0 to 50 percent in the spodic horizon.\nThe O horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 4.\nSome pedons have an A horizon up to 10 cm thick that has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, or an Ap horizon that has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam or their gravelly analogues.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand, or their gravelly analogues.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is dominantly fine sandy loam, but includes sandy loam or their gravelly analogues. Combined thickness of the Bhs horizon is 0 to 15 cm.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam, or their gravelly analogues.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or their gravelly or cobbly analogues.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon below the B horizon 2 inches thick or less. It has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture range is the same as the lower part of the B, but typically it is coarser textured than the overlying horizon.\nThe Cd layer has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is loamy sand or loamy fine sand, or it comprised of loamy layers and sandy lenses with a composite texture of loamy sand, loamy fine sand, loamy coarse sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or their gravelly or cobbly analogues. The lenses range from loamy fine sand to coarse sand and are 3 to 51 mm thick. They constitute more than 20 percent of the layer. The Cd layer has weak or moderate, thin to thick plates or it is massive. Consistence is firm or very firm except in individual lenses where it is friable to loose.\nSome pedons have a friable C horizon above the Cd 20 cm thick or less."

The somewhat excessively drained Hermon and Success soils, well drained Monadnock soils, moderately well drained Waumbek soils, and somewhat poorly drained and poorly drained Moosilauke soils have friable substrata. The well drained Tunbridge soils are on bedrock controlled landforms and have bedrock within 102 cm of the mineral surface."
