  "OVERVIEW": "The Sentinel series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments derived from granitoid rock and some volcanic ash. These soils are on lake terraces and mountain valleys. Slope is 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches (940 millimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F (11.7 degrees C).",
