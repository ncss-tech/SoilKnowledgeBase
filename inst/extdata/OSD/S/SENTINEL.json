The difference between mean winter and mean summer soil temperature is about 28 degrees F (17 degrees C). The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from early July to early November (140-160 days) and is moist in all parts from December to mid May. Fine gravel content is 0 to 5 percent. Base saturation by ammonium acetate is 50 to 70 percent in the upper part of the A horizon and decreases to 40 to 50 percent in the lower part of the A horizon. Base saturation is 35 to 45 percent in the Bw and C horizons. The sand fraction contains 5 to 20 percent volcanic glass and has other vitrandic properties.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sentinel soils are on lake terraces and mountain valleys. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent and are linear to slightly convex in shape. These soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments derived from granitoid rock and some volcanic ash. Elevation is 3,955 to 3,996 feet (1,205.4 to 1,217.9 meters). The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 35 to 40 inches (889 to 1,016 millimeters), some of which falls as snow. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 F (10.0 to 12.8 degrees C). The mean January temperature is about 36 degrees F (2.2 degrees C). The mean July temperature is about 72 degrees F.
