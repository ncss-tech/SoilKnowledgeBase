  "REVDATE": "03/2001",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Smithwick series consists of moderately deep, well drained,\nvery slowly permeable soils that formed in shaly materials.  These soils are strongly sloping to steep on uplands.  Water runs off\nthe surface at a rapid rate.  Slopes range from 8 to 45 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  When dry these soils have cracks as much as 1 to 3.5 cm\nwide that extend from the surface to a depth of 20 inches or more.  Clay content ranges from 60 to 80 percent in the 10 to 40 inch control section.  Siliceous pebbles and cobbles cover from a few\nto about 15 percent of the surface.  Cobbles comprise less than 50 percent of the coarse fragments.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Clay content ranges from 55 to 75 percent.\nThe B2 horizon has a hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The B2 horizons contain from 0 to 3\npercent cobbles and from 0 to 3 percent pebbles.\nThe B3 horizon has a hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and\nchroma of 2 through 4.  Concretions and soft masses of calcium carbonate range from a few to about 5 percent by volume.  The B3 horizons contain from 0 to 3 percent cobbles and from 0 to 3\npercent pebbles.\nThe Cr horizon has a hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma from 0 through 4.  This is neutral through moderately\nalkaline shale, very shaly clay or shaly clay.  This material can\nbe dug with a spade."

Other competing series include the Boro, Brackett,\nChargo, Denhawken, Ellis, Leeray, Mangum, Owens, Runn, Throck, and Vernon series.

In addition, Boro soils have mean annual temperatures of less than 59 degrees F.; Brackett soils have more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; Chargo and Runn\nsoils have mean annual temperature of more than 72 degrees F; Denhawken soils have mean annual temperatures of more than 72\ndegrees F.; Ellis soils are moist in the moisture control section\nfor longer periods; Leeray soils have sola thicker than 40 inches\nand have intersecting slickensides; Mangum soils formed in recent alluvial sediments; Owens soils have sola thinner than 20 inches;\nand Vernon soils have hues of 5YR or redder."

Surfaces are plane to\nstrongly convex with slopes of 8 to 45 percent, averaging about 20 percent.  At the type location, the soil formed in residuum from Smithwick shale of the Atoka epoch of the Pennsylvanian period.\nMean annual temperature ranges from 64 degrees to 72 degrees F.; average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 30 inches; and Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 40 to 52."

All these soils except Tarpley have less than 60 percent clay in their control sections. Tarpley soils are on higher lying plateaus and have a lithic contact with\nlimestone at depths of 10 to 20 inches.  Cho soils are on high\nlying ridges and are underlain by cemented caliche at depths of\nless than 20 inches.  Nukrum soils are on footslopes as valley\nfill, have mollic epipedons and sola more than 40 inches thick.  Nuvalde soils are on ancient terraces and have a mollic epipedon.  Frio soils have thick mollic epipedons and are on flood plains."
