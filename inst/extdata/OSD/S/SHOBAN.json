  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Most areas of the Shoban series were mapped as the Tindahay series in the Fort Hall Area Soil Survey, 1977.  The Shoban series is being differentiated by recognition of a mollic epipedon, a calcic horizon, and a high water table, all of which are not present in the Tindahay series.  Drilling logs in the area where the Shoban series is mapped show a strata of clay is common at at a depth of 6 to 12 feet.  This clay strata is the likely cause of the perched water table in the Shoban series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 16 inches (Ap1, Ap2, and A horizons)\nCalcic horizon - the zone from 22 to 80 inches (Bk, Bkg1, and Bkg2 horizons)\nAquic subgroup - redox concentrations present below 22 inches and aquic conditions present within 30 inches during part of the year.\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the Ap2 horizon, the A, BA, and Bk horizons, and part of the Bkg1 horizon)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
