  "OVERVIEW": "The Shoban series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium that has been modified by wind.  Permeability is very rapid.  Shoban soils are on broad stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Most areas of the Shoban series were mapped as the Tindahay series in the Fort Hall Area Soil Survey, 1977.  The Shoban series is being differentiated by recognition of a mollic epipedon, a calcic horizon, and a high water table, all of which are not present in the Tindahay series.  Drilling logs in the area where the Shoban series is mapped show a strata of clay is common at at a depth of 6 to 12 feet.  This clay strata is the likely cause of the perched water table in the Shoban series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 16 inches (Ap1, Ap2, and A horizons)\nCalcic horizon - the zone from 22 to 80 inches (Bk, Bkg1, and Bkg2 horizons)\nAquic subgroup - redox concentrations present below 22 inches and aquic conditions present within 30 inches during part of the year.\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the Ap2 horizon, the A, BA, and Bk horizons, and part of the Bkg1 horizon)"
