  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 48 to 72 inches.  The solum lacks carbonates.  It contains 25 to 50 percent sand.  The A horizon is very dark brown (10YR 2/2), black (10YR 2/1) or very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2).  It generally is loam, but silt loam with a sand content of at least 25 percent is allowed.  The A horizon ranges from medium acid to neutral.  A B1 horizon is present in some pedons.  The B2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Pedons with chroma of 3 or 4 have mottles with chroma of 2 or less.  The B2 horizon typically has mottles of higher chroma and value.  It typically is loam, but in some pedons it is silt loam with at least 25 percent sand.  The clay content averages 18 to 25 percent, but some subhorizons range as low as 14 percent.  This horizon is medium acid or slightly acid.  The B3 horizon has the same range in colors as the B2 horizon.  It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Some strati- fication is permitted.  The C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 8, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It generally is stratified and includes silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam and loamy sand."

Crippin soils have free carbonates at depths of 10 inches or less.  The Floyd, Merton, Nicollet, Readlyn, and Wilmonton soils contain coarse fragments in part of the solum.  The Fostoria soils are less acid, have a thinner solum and are lower in available phosphorus.  Also, they are in an area of less rainfall.  Kensett soils have hard limestone bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Ottosen soils contain more clay.  Nevin soils contain more clay and less sand.  Rowley soils contain less sand and have argillic horizons."

The Flagler soils contain more sand and less clay in the B horizon, and they contain 5 to 15 percent gravel in the C horizon.  The Vesser soils contain less sand and more clay in the B horizon, have an A2 horizon and are somewhat poorly and poorly drained."
