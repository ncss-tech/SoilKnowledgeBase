Farrell soils average less than 10 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Malott soils are deep to duripans.  Tickason soils have calcic horizons at depths of 30 to 58 cm.  Tonasket soils have texture of loam, silt loam, and very fine sandy loam and average less than 10 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."
