  "OVERVIEW": "The Shantown series consist of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in re-worked alluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Shantown soils are on upper beach plains and beach bars.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
