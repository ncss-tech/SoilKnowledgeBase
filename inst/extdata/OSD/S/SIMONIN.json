  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Related series in other families are the Coyne, Elston, Hesch, Nottawa, Onarga, and Rassett series.  Coyne, Elston, and Nottawa soils have sola more than 40 inches thick and are underlain with sandy or gravelly sediments.  Hesch soils formed in 20 to 40 inches of loamy material over sandstone bedrock.  Onarga soils contain less clay in the lower part of the solum and are underlain with sandy and loamy sediments.  Rassett soils contain less clay and are stratified in the subsoil and do not have mottles above a depth of 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Simonin soils are on rises on nearly level lake plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in 20 to 36 inches of sandy outwash and the underlying clayey sediments.  In many areas the sandy sediments have been reworked by wind.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 53 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 35 to 39 inches."

Iroquois and Montgomery soils are on lower lying topographic positions and have a predominantly gray subsoil.  Nesius soils are on similar topographic positions, and have sandy textures to depths greater than 60 inches.  Papineau and Strole soils are on lower lying landscape positions and have 2 chroma mottles within a depth of 6 inches below the base of the mollic epipedon."
