  "OVERVIEW": "The Simonin series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils on lake plains.  They formed in 20 to 36 inches of sandy outwash deposits and the underlying lacustrine sediments.  They are rapidly and moderately rapidly permeable in the upper part of the solum and slowly permeable in the lower part of the solum and the underlying clayey sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches.",

Coyne, Elston, and Nottawa soils have sola more than 40 inches thick and are underlain with sandy or gravelly sediments.  Hesch soils formed in 20 to 40 inches of loamy material over sandstone bedrock.  Onarga soils contain less clay in the lower part of the solum and are underlain with sandy and loamy sediments.  Rassett soils contain less clay and are stratified in the subsoil and do not have mottles above a depth of 60 inches."
