  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils are rarely flooded and, when flooded, receive very little sediment. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 56 inches and is evenly distributed throughout the year. Mean annual temperature ranges from 59 degrees to 66 degrees F. Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 70 to 76."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Kenn series and the Avilla, Ceda, Cupco, Dela, Neff, and Rexor series. Kenn soils commonly occur upstream and closer to the source of sediments. Avilla soils are on adjacent terraces and have sola greater than 60 inches and lower base saturation. Ceda soils are on flood plains and have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. Cupco and Neff soils have a fine silty control section. Cupco soils are somewhat poorly drained and Neff soils are moderately well drained. Dela soils do not have argillic horizons and are at lower elevations nearer the stream channel. Rexor soils are at lower elevations nearer the stream channel and are fine silty."
