  "OVERVIEW": "The Speer series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy sediments. These soils are on nearly level or very gently sloping flood plains or low terraces of major streams in the Ouachita Mountains, MLRA 119. Water runs off the surface slow to medium. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.",

Kenn soils commonly occur upstream and closer to the source of sediments. Avilla soils are on adjacent terraces and have sola greater than 60 inches and lower base saturation. Ceda soils are on flood plains and have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. Cupco and Neff soils have a fine silty control section. Cupco soils are somewhat poorly drained and Neff soils are moderately well drained. Dela soils do not have argillic horizons and are at lower elevations nearer the stream channel. Rexor soils are at lower elevations nearer the stream channel and are fine silty."
