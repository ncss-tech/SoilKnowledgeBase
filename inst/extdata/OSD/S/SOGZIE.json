    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sogzie soils are on summits of mesas, undulating plateaus, fan terraces, and dipslopes of cuestas. They formed in eolian material, alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and siltstone.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Elevation ranges from 4,600 to 6,200 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 130 to 160 days."

Sheppard soils are sandy and occur on stable dunes. Whit soils are fine-silty and occur on adjacent undulating plateaus."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 5 inches. (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 5 to about 70 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, Btk1, and 2Btk2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 39 to about 70 inches. (2Btk2 horizon)\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Reference samples were taken at series type location and analyzed for particle-size, organic matter, and calcium carbonate equivalence at the BIA soils lab in Gallup, NM as sample S88NM-045-3.  Calcium carbonate equivalence on other pedons was determined with a field volume calcimeter. Lab results confirm the presence of a silicate clay bulge. Percent of size fraction larger than very fine sand is also greater than 15 percent as determined by the lab analyses and also wet sieve analysis.\nUpdated and revised for the correlation of Ft.
