  "OVERVIEW": "The Sogzie series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material, alluvium, and residuum derived from sandstone and siltstone. Sogzie soils are on summits of mesas, fan terraces, undulating plateaus, and dipslopes of cuestas. Permeability is moderately rapid. Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

(2Btk2 horizon)\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Reference samples were taken at series type location and analyzed for particle-size, organic matter, and calcium carbonate equivalence at the BIA soils lab in Gallup, NM as sample S88NM-045-3.  Calcium carbonate equivalence on other pedons was determined with a field volume calcimeter. Lab results confirm the presence of a silicate clay bulge. Percent of size fraction larger than very fine sand is also greater than 15 percent as determined by the lab analyses and also wet sieve analysis.\nUpdated and revised for the correlation of Ft.
