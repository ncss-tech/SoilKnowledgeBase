  "OVERVIEW": "The Stash series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from loess and volcanics. They are on toeslopes of canyonsides and foothills and have slopes of 20 to 30 percent.  Permeability is slow.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
