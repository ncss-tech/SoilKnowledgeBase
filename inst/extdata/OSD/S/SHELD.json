    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The volcanic ash mantle is 20 to 40 inches thick.  Depth to a paralithic contact of weathered basalt is 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 degrees to 47 degrees F.   The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F.  from May 1 to November 10 and exceeds 47 degrees F.  from June 1 to October 20.  The soil is dry in the 8-to 24-inch control section from mid-July to mid-October and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  The bulk density ranges from 0.6 to 1 g/cc to a depth of 10 to 20 inches but is 0.85 g/cc or more at a depth of 10 to 14 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick.\nThe A horizon dry colors are (10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 5/2). Moist colors are (10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3; 7.5YR 3/2; 5YR 3/2; 5YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3). It is very stony or stony sandy loam in the A1 and A2 and gravelly sandy loam in the A3, with about 5 to 10 percent clay content.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent.  The rock fragments consist of stones, cobbles, and gravel.  It is slightly acid to strongly acid and the base saturation ranges from 40 to 60 percent but is less than 50 percent in at least part of the upper 10 inches.  The NaF pH ranges from 9.8 to 10.6 and commonly is highest at the surface.\nThe Bt horizon colors are (7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 6/2, 6/4; 5YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4). Moist colors are (5YR 3/3, 4/3). It is very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly loam with about 6 to 12 percent clay content.  There commonly are a few thin clay films in the lower part in most pedons.  There is only 1 or 2 percent increase in clay over the A horizon.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent and consist mostly of gravel with some stones and cobbles.  It is slightly acid or medium acid and the base saturation ranges from 30 to 60 percent.  The NaF pH is about 9.0 to 9.5.\nThe 2Btb horizon colors are (7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 6/2; 5YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2; 2.5YR 5/2, 5/4). Moist colors are (7.5YR 3/2, 4/2, 4/4; 5YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/2.  4/3, 4/4; 2.5YR 2/4.  3/2, 3/4, 5/2, 4/4). It is very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly loam with about 10 to 20 percent clay content.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent and consist mostly of gravel with some stones and cobbles.  It is slightly acid, strongly acid and the base saturation ranges from 50 to 65 percent.  The NaF pH ranges from 8.5 to 9.0.  This horizon has slightly less influence from amorphous materials."

Pheeney and Waca soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches and lack buried Bt horizons.  Tumac soils have greater than 60 percent vitric pyroclastic material in the upper 14 inches of the sol.  Windy soils lack buried Bt horizons.  Iller soils have a medial over loamy-skeletal control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sheld soils are on mountains where more recent volcanic ash has been deposited over materials weathering from tuff, tuff breccia, or hard andesite or basaltic bedrock.  Slopes are 9 to 65 percent.  These soils have formed in the more recent ash deposits.  Elevations are 4,500 to 7,500 feet.  The climate is continental and subhumid with warm nearly dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 20 to 45 inches.  Snowfall is 24 to 48 inches and covers the higher elevations from late November to early April in most years.  Mean January temperature is 22 degrees to 30 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 59 degrees to 65 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 37 degrees to 45 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 35 to 70 days."

Esro soils have an aquic moisture regime and a fine-silty control section.  Orset soils have an ochric epipedon and have a coarse-loamy control section.
