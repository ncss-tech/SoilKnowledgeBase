  "OVERVIEW": "The Sheld series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash deposits over colluvium and material weathered from tuff, tuff breccia, or extrusive igneous bedrock.  Sheld soils are on mountains and have slopes of 9 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 42 degrees to 47 degrees F.   The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F.  from May 1 to November 10 and exceeds 47 degrees F.  from June 1 to October 20.  The soil is dry in the 8-to 24-inch control section from mid-July to mid-October and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  The bulk density ranges from 0.6 to 1 g/cc to a depth of 10 to 20 inches but is 0.85 g/cc or more at a depth of 10 to 14 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick.\nThe A horizon dry colors are (10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 5/2). Moist colors are (10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3; 7.5YR 3/2; 5YR 3/2; 5YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3). It is very stony or stony sandy loam in the A1 and A2 and gravelly sandy loam in the A3, with about 5 to 10 percent clay content.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent.  The rock fragments consist of stones, cobbles, and gravel.  It is slightly acid to strongly acid and the base saturation ranges from 40 to 60 percent but is less than 50 percent in at least part of the upper 10 inches.  The NaF pH ranges from 9.8 to 10.6 and commonly is highest at the surface.\nThe Bt horizon colors are (7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 6/2, 6/4; 5YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4). Moist colors are (5YR 3/3, 4/3). It is very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly loam with about 6 to 12 percent clay content.  There commonly are a few thin clay films in the lower part in most pedons.  There is only 1 or 2 percent increase in clay over the A horizon.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent and consist mostly of gravel with some stones and cobbles.  It is slightly acid or medium acid and the base saturation ranges from 30 to 60 percent.  The NaF pH is about 9.0 to 9.5.\nThe 2Btb horizon colors are (7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 6/2; 5YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2; 2.5YR 5/2, 5/4).
