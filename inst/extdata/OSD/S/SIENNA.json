    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. These soils are usually moist but are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days. The mollic epipedon is 8 to 14 inches thick and may include the upper part of the Bt horizon. Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. The particle-size control section has 35 to 60 percent rock fragments dominated by rounded gravel of quartzitic origin in addition to subangular fragments of basaltic origin.  It ranges from 25 to 35 percent clay. Soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and moist. The Bt1 horizon is very gravelly silt loam, very gravelly clay loam, or very gravelly clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay. The Bt2 horizon is very cobbly clay loam or very gravelly silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sienna soils are on plateaus, canyon shoulder slopes and ridges at elevations of 2,600 to 3,800 feet.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in old alluvium from the Ellensburg formation and residuum derived from basalt. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches. The average January temperature is 28 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 68 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free season is 120 to 170 days."
