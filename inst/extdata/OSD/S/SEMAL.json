These soils are usually dry in all parts of the moisture control section for more than half of the time when the soil temperature is above 40 degrees F. The particle-size control section averages 5 to 15 percent clay and 35 to 65 percent rock fragments by volume. Organic matter is estimated to range from 0.5 to 1 percent in the A horizon. Depth to strongly cemented duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry. Texture is cobbly sandy loam, very cobbly sandy loam, or stony sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Texture is very gravelly sandy loam, gravelly fine sandy loam or very gravelly fine sandy loam. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bq horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Texture is extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, very gravelly loamy sand or extremely gravelly loamy sand. It is weakly cemented in some pedons.\nThe 3Bkqm and 3Bkq horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. The 3Bkqm horizon is extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand or extremely cobbly loamy coarse sand. The 3Bkq horizon is extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, extremely cobbly coarse sand or extremely gravelly coarse sand or extremely cobbly loamy coarse sand. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. The 3Bkq horizon is absent in some pedons."
