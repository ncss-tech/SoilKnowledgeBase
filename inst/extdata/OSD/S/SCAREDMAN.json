  "OVERVIEW": "The Scaredman series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on mountain sideslopes.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from welded tuffs and flow basalts.   Slopes range form 30 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 70 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degres F.",
