  "OVERVIEW": "The Silvies series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium containing some volcanic ash. These soils are on flood plains and in basins and have slopes of 0 to 7 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature is less than 55 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is over 60 inches. The soil is saturated from spring to summer.  The particle-size control section is silty clay loam to clay and averages 35 to 60 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.  Organic matter decreases irregularly with depth.  The linear extensibility is 6.0 to 8.0 centimeters within the upper meter.\nThe upper part of the A horizon has (4 to 10 percent organic matter).  The A horizon has value of 2 and chroma from 0 to 1.  Structure is weak or moderate coarse or medium prismatic to moderate fine and very fine granular.  It has a moist bulk density of 1.0 to 1.3 in the surface horizon.\nThe AC and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y value of 2 to 4 and chromas from 0 to 2.  Some pedons have sand and gravel below 40 inches."
