    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Shircliff soils are on nearly level to gently sloping areas are on treads and more sloping areas are on risers of lake plains. They formed in 15 to 51 cm (6 to 20 inches) of loess and the underlying calcareous, clayey lacustrine deposits. The slope gradient is 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 14 degrees C (51 degrees to 57 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Frost free days range from 170 to 200. Elevation ranges from 114 to 183 meters (375 to 600 feet) above mean sea level."

The concept of the Markland soils has been revised to be well drained and not have a water table above a depth of 1.8 meters or six feet.\nDiagnostic surface and subsurface horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon: 0 to 20 cm or 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon)\n2) Argillic horizon: 20 to 203 cm or 8 to 80 inches (Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Btk1, 2Btk2, and 2Btk3 horizons)\n3) Redoximorphic depletions: 48 to 203 cm or 19 to 80 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data on the typical pedon S93IN-123-003 is at the NSSC, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
