    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dehy, Dithod, and Dresslewet (T) series.\nDehy soils are dominated by sandy loam in the particle-size control section and have cambic horizons that are 18 to 26 inches thick.  Dithod soils have an aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.  Dresslewet soils have an aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric and have horizons with more than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."

These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks such as quartzite, sandstone, limestone, and granite.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 22 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 63 to 72 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 100 to 170 days."

Kirkham soils are fine-silty.  Martini soils have endosaturation deeper than 100 centimeters from the soil surface.  Steed soils are sandy-skeletal and have endosaturation deeper than 100 centimeters from the soil surface."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 2.5 and 3.3 feet (moderately deep free water occurrence class) between April and September.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods year-round or occasional flooding for very long periods between March and May."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Sunset soils are used for rangeland, irrigated cropland, and urban development.  Irrigated areas are used for growing alfalfa hay, small grains, improved pasture, sugar beets, and truck crops.  The native vegetation in rangeland is Wyoming big sagebrush, bunchgrasses, wild rose, gumweed, and annual weeds."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 inches (Ap and A horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 30 and 40 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the AC and C1 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (AC horizon and parts of the A and C1 horizons).\nThis revision of February 2006 updates the taxonomic class from Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluvaquentic Haplustolls based on the depth to the seasonal high saturation of more than 30 inches and on the assumed moisture regime being xeric instead of ustic.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 144-145, Table 11 of the Soil Survey of Davis-Weber Area, Utah.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
