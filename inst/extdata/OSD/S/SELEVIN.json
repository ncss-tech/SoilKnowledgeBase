  "OVERVIEW": "The Selevin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from granite and gneiss.  Selevin soils are on fan mesas or fan terraces and have slopes of 2 to l5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about l4 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
