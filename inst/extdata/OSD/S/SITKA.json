Thickness of the solum ranges from 14 to 50 inches. Phosphorous retention is greater than 85 percent. Bulk density throughout the soil is less than 0.90 g/cc. Moist 15 bar water is between 30 and 100 percent. Reaction increases with depth, ranging from extremely acid to slightly acid. The coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 20 percent gravel size pumice.\nThe E horizon has hue from 5YR to 10YR, value moist of 4 or 5 and chroma moist of 1 or 2. Texture is commonly fine sandy loam but ranges to include silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam. The Bh horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, and chroma moist of 0 or 1. Texture is dominantly very fine sandy loam but ranges to include sandy loam, silt loam, or loam, often with substantial organic carbon content.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value and chroma moist of 2 or 3. Texture is dominantly very fine sandy loam but ranges to include fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or silt loam. This horizon may be absent in some pedons.\nA Bs horizon is present in some pedons.
