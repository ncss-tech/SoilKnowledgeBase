  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The Space City soils are usually noncalcareous to depths of 18 to 30 inches but depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 10 to 40 inches.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 14 percent in a majority of subhorizons in the control section.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate ranges from 15 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section is loamy fine sand, loamy sand or sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent and are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 64 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It ranges from mildly to strongly alkaline, and has 2 to about 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth fraction."

Corlett soils are calcareous at or near the surface and have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium. Costilla soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments.  Cotopaxi soils are noncalcareous to depths of more than 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Space City soils are in sloping dune-like areas along the margins of intermountain valleys and basins or small ridges on the valley floors.  Slope gradients range from O to 15 percent.  The soils formed in wind reworked sediments of mixed mineralogy.  The average annual precipitation is 7 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F., and mean summer temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F."
