Significant areas of the Stutler series that have a bouldery or stony subsoil were observed in 2005 in Spokane County.\nThis series is correlated to a ponderosa pine/common snowberry (PIPO/SYAL) habitat type.\n6/2016--This official series description (OSD) was updated as part of the final correlation of the Spokane County, Washington, soil survey. The formatting was updated according to SSR1 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015).\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data--soil survey sample number 00WA063001; Spokane County, Washington; Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory pedon number 01P0250\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
