Lenz, Raiso, and Vanbrunt soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Louiecreek soils have a particle-size control section that averages 8 to 15 percent clay. Peka soils have a densic contact.  Speigle soils have a particle-size control section 10 to 20 percent clay. Whitestone soils have angular rock fragments."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sinlahekin soils are in glacial valleys.  These soils formed in glacial outwash with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface. Slopes are 3 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,500 to 2,000 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 18 inches. The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F.; mean July temperature is about 68 degrees F.; and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
