  "OVERVIEW": "The Sinlahekin series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial outwash with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface. These soils are in glacial valleys. Slopes are 3 to 15 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
