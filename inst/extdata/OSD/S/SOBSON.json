The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 12 to 30 inches.  Particle size control section, when averaged, is sandy loam or fine sandy loam with 10 to 18 percent clay.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent channers.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.  This horizon is free of carbonates throughout.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam when averaged.  Thin lenses of loamy sand or channery sandy loam occur immediately above the bedrock in some pedons.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sobson soils are on nearly level and undulating pediments and fan aprons.  They are formed in residuum and colluvial slopewash derived from sandstone with a wind-shifted surface.  Slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  Elevation is 6,500 to 7,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 to 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 37 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to be about 60 to 90 days depending upon elevation, aspect, and air drainage."
