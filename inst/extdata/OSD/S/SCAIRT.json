Cabbart and Kirby soils are on knobs and ridges on uplands.  Cabbart soils have soft bedrock at depths of 10 to 20 inches.  Kirby soils are underlain by porcelanite at depths of 10 to 20 inches.  Gerda and Maltese soils are intermixed with the Scairt soils.  They do not have soft bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches."
