  "OVERVIEW": "The Scairt series consists of moderately deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in residuum weathered from saline-alkali soft shale, siltstone or mudstone.  These soils are on fans, flats and ridges on uplands and in badlands.  They have slopes of 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches.",
