  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the underlying fine-textured material ranges dominantly from 20 to 40 inches with a few pedons ranging to 18 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Consistence is very friable or friable in the coarse-loamy mantle and are absent below.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the coarse-loamy mantle and from moderately acid to moderately alkaline below.\nThe Ap horizon, or A horizon where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  It has weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular structure.\nThe Eg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  It has weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular structure.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4 and has distinct and prominent redox concentrations.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam, but some pedons have thin loamy fine sand subhorizons.  It has weak, very fine or fine granular or moderate medium subangular blocky structure.\nThe E' horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3 and has faint to prominent redox concentrations.  The E' horizon is fine sandy loam or sandy loam, but some pedons where the horizon is thin are loamy fine sand.  It has weak fine granular or weak or moderate, thin to thick platy structure.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 0 to 4.  Redox concentrations are faint to prominent, but may be absent in the lower part.  The 2C horizon is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  It has weak or moderate, thin to very thick platy or weak or moderate, very fine to medium subangular or angular blocky structure, all of which is inherited from the parent material, or the horizon is massive."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Swanton soils are in depressional areas on marine and lake plains, outwash plains, or deltas.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  The soils formed in loamy outwash or lacustrine deposits underlain by fine-textured lacustrine and marine deposits.  The climate is humid and cool temperate.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 46 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 48 inches.  The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 5 to 900 feet above mean sea level."
