  "OVERVIEW": "The Sehorn series consists of moderately deep, well drained soil on foothills. These soils formed in residuum weathered from calcareous sandstone and shale. Slope ranges from 2 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 60 to 63 degrees F.  Cracks 3/8 to 1 inch wide develop in the soil during late May and June and cracks remain open until October and November.  Cracks remain closed during the rest of the year.  Cracks extend from the surface to a depth of 20 inches or down to shale bedrock.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 5/4, 4/4, 5/3; 2.5Y 5/2, 5/3, 5/4; 5Y 5/2. Moist 10YR 4/4, 4/3, 3/3; 2.5Y 4/2, 4/3; 5Y 4/3. Texture is silty clay, silty clay loam, clay loam or clay.  This horizon usually has moderate to strong prismatic angular blocky or subangular blocky structure, but some pedons have granular or platy structure.  Reaction is slightly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bss horizons generally have colors as listed above, although value may be little higher or a little lower than in the A horizon.  These horizons are clay or silty clay with an average of 40 to 60 percent clay.  There is a small increase in clay content from upper horizons to lower horizons, but clay films are lacking.  Few to common intersecting slickensides are present, but strong evidence of churning is absent.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have lime with segregations just above the bedrock or in fractures in the upper part of the bedrock."

Altamont, Auld, Capay, Centerville, Cibo, Porterville, and Seville soils have moist value of 3 throughout the upper 12 inches or more of the profile.  Also, Capay, Porterville, Seville, and Myers soils lack lithic or paralithic contacts.  Balcom, Castaic, and Nacimiento soils lack slickensides and have less than 35 percent clay in the control section."

The climate is subhumid, with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 35 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 58 to 64 degrees F.; the average January temperature is 42 degrees F.; and the average July temperature is 75 degrees F.  The frost free season is about 200 to 300 days."
