Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 14 degrees C (48 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 155 to 225 days. Elevation is 271 to 311 meters (890 to 1020 feet) above mean sea level."

Blanchester and Clermont soils are poorly drained and are in depressions or on flats. Jonesboro and Rossmoyne soils are moderately well drained and are on swells or convex parts of the landscape. Nicely soils are moderately well drained and are on shoulder positions. Westboro soils do not have a fragipan and are on similar landscape positions."

The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between January and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is medium or high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low or low above and below the fragipan and low in the fragipan. Permeability is slow and very slow above and below the fragipan and very slow in the fragipan."
