  "OVERVIEW": "The Schaffer series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are moderately deep to a fragipan. These soils formed in loess and the underlying till. They are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
