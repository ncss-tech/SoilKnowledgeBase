  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 10 to 38 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Redoximorphic features consisting of iron depletions or reduced matrices occur within 20 inches of the mineral soil surface. Rock fragments, mainly gravel, cobbles and stones, range from 2 to 45 percent by volume in the mineral subsurface layer and subsoil, and from 5 to 45 percent in the substratum. Large stones and boulders commonly occupy 0.1 to 15 percent of the soil surface.\nThe O horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2. The material is muck, mucky peat, or peat. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through slightly acid.\nSome pedons have an E horizon.\nThe AB or A horizon is neutral or has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 0 through 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam with mucky, gravelly or cobbly analogs in some pedons. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through neutral.\nThe B horizon is neutral in color or has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 3. It has faint or distinct redox depletions or faint, distinct, or prominent concentrations. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. Lenses or thin subhorizons of loamy sand, loamy fine sand or silt are in some pedons. Structure is granular or subangular blocky. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe C horizons, and 2C horizons if present, have hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 6.  They have faint to prominent redox depletions or concentrations. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam. Where fluvial sorting has influenced the substratum, thin layers or lenses of loamy sand, loamy fine sand, very fine sand or silt are common. Those pedons having 2C and 3C horizons often formed as a result of fluvial action or past colluvial deposition. Structure is absent or the horizons are platy. Consistence ranges from loose to friable, but some pedons have firm subhorizons. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Nahma and Waucedah series in the same family. The Nahma soils have bedrock a lithic contact within a depth of 40 inches. The Waucedah soils average less than 5 percent rock fragments by volume throughout the soil.\nClosely related soils are the Pleine, Rollaway, Sago and Witbeck soils. The Pleine and Sago soils have higher activity clay mineralogy. The Rollaway and Witbeck soils have lower activity clay mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These nearly level to gently sloping soils are in slightly concave areas, along shallow drainageways or on toeslopes between glaciated hills, ridges and mountains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. These soils formed in Wisconsin age ablation till derived from igneous, meta-igneous and in some places sandstone rocks. Colluvium or congeliturbate is often mixed with the till. In some places fluvial action has altered the regolith. Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F, mean annual precipitation ranges from 33 to 48 inches, and the frost-free period ranges from 80 to 130 days. Elevation ranges from 700 to 2400 feet above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Sabattis soils are commonly associated with well drained Berkshire soils and moderately well drained Sunapee soils that are on surrounding higher landscapes. Better drained Becket, Skerry and Potsdam soils that have dense substrata, are also associated on higher adjacent landforms in some places. Lyme soils are on nearby slightly higher benches in a few areas, and Pillsbury soils which have a dense substratum, are also associates."
