  "OVERVIEW": "The Southhaven series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy colluvial-alluvial sediments on pitted outwash plains and stream terraces. They have moderate permeability in the upper part and rapid permeability in the lower part. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
