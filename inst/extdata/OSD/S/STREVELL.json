Bertelson soils formed in alluvium\nderived from volcanic tuff and igneous rocks and have a bulk density of\nless than 1.2 gr/cc.  Declo soils average less than 15 percent gravel\nin the control section and lack very gravelly horizons.  Eccles and\nEscalante soils have moderately coarse and coarse textures throughout\nthe control section.  Palisade soils lack coarse fragments and a\nlithologic discontinuity in the control section.  Somsen soils are\nmoderately deep to bedrock."

The soil formed in mixed alluvium.  The average annual\nprecipitation is about 8 to 12 inches; the average annual air\ntemperature is about 45 to 47 degrees F; and the frost-free season is\n95 to 130 days.  Strevell soils are normally saline.  Where this soil\nis used for irrigated crops, the soil is nonsaline to slightly saline."
