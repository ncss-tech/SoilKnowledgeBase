  "OVERVIEW": "The Strevell series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that have\nmoderate permeability.  They have formed in mixed alluvium on coalesced\nfan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 12 percent.  The average annual\ntemperature is about 46 degrees F; the average annual precipitation is\nabout 10 inches.",

Bertelson soils formed in alluvium\nderived from volcanic tuff and igneous rocks and have a bulk density of\nless than 1.2 gr/cc.  Declo soils average less than 15 percent gravel\nin the control section and lack very gravelly horizons.  Eccles and\nEscalante soils have moderately coarse and coarse textures throughout\nthe control section.  Palisade soils lack coarse fragments and a\nlithologic discontinuity in the control section.  Somsen soils are\nmoderately deep to bedrock."
