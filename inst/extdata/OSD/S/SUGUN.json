  "OVERVIEW": "The Sugun series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly and moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, limestone, shale, and quartzite.  Sugun soils are on alluvial flats.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
