  "OVERVIEW": "The Strell series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in eolian deposits overlying sandstone on hillslopes, mesas or cuestas.  Slopes are 1 to 45 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Typic ustic moisture regime due to high infiltration rates and perching of water.\nMean annual soil temperature:  42 to 47 degrees F.\nDepth to lithic contact:  5 to 20 inches to sandstone.\nRock Fragments: 0 to 15 percent.\nParticle-size control section:  0 to 5 percent clay.\nA horizon:\nHue:  7.5YR or 10YR\nValue:  4 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist\nChroma:  2 to 4\nReaction:  neutral or slightly alkaline\nC horizon:\nHue:  7.5YR or 10YR\nValue:  5 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist\nChroma:  2 to 6.  Note--decomposing root material often causes value of 5 dry, 3 moist and chroma of 2 to occur 1 to 2 inches above the sandstone.\nTexture:  loamy sand, sand, coarse sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand\nReaction:  neutral to moderately alkaline"
