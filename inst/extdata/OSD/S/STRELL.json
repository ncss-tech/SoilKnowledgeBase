Typic ustic moisture regime due to high infiltration rates and perching of water.\nMean annual soil temperature:  42 to 47 degrees F.\nDepth to lithic contact:  5 to 20 inches to sandstone.\nRock Fragments: 0 to 15 percent.\nParticle-size control section:  0 to 5 percent clay.\nA horizon:\nHue:  7.5YR or 10YR\nValue:  4 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist\nChroma:  2 to 4\nReaction:  neutral or slightly alkaline\nC horizon:\nHue:  7.5YR or 10YR\nValue:  5 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist\nChroma:  2 to 6.  Note--decomposing root material often causes value of 5 dry, 3 moist and chroma of 2 to occur 1 to 2 inches above the sandstone.\nTexture:  loamy sand, sand, coarse sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand\nReaction:  neutral to moderately alkaline"
