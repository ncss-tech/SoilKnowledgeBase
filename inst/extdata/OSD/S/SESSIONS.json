  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sessions soils are on moderately steep and steep ground moraines, glacial basins and kettles of glaciated mountains at elevations of 6,300 to 10,600 feet.  Slope gradients are 2 to 35 percent.  The soils formed mainly in glacial till derived from mixed sedimentary parent rocks, principally sandstone, quartzite, shale but some formed in alluvium on fans in materials from gneiss and schist.  The climate is humid with average annual precipitation of 22 to 35 inches, falling mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 35 to 44 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 55 to 60 degrees F.  The freeze-free period is 20 to 80 days."
