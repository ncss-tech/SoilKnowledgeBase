  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Canoto, Canutio, Cavespring, Emot, Ogral, and Yermo soils.  Canoto soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources and are dry in the soil moisture control section during the summer months. Canutio, Emot, and Ogral soils are moist in the soil moisture control section for more than 20 days cumulative in the summer. In addition, Emot soils average more than 18 percent clay and 50 percent silt in the particle-size control section and Ogral soils have nongravelly A and upper C horizons. Cavespring soils are neutral to moderately alkaline and do not have buried Bkb horizons. Yermo soils are dry in the soil moisture control section throughout the summer months. In addition, they have less than 25 percent gravel in the A and upper C horizons.  Series where the CEC activity class has not been updated but are in the same family are the Forlorn and Spellacy series.  Forlorn soils formed in mixed alluvium derived from metamorphic and volcanic sources.  Spellacy soils are moderately deep, derived from shale, and located on hills and mountains."
