    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 18 centimeters (A horizon)\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 18 to 200 centimeters (BAt, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4 & BCt horizons)\n3. Palehumult feature - clay does not decrease by as much as 20 percent of its maximum within 150 centimeters of the ground surface\n4. Particle-size control section - the zone from 18 to 68 centimeters, averages 30 percent clay, by weight, and 46 percent rock fragments, by volume.\nThe type location was moved in 2005 to better reflect the series concept.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNASIS User Pedon ID: 04CA605REDW083\nSource: 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
