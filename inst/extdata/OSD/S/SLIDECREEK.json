  "OVERVIEW": "The Slidecreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from sandstone and mudstone. Slidecreek soils are on mountains and have slopes of 9 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2160 millimeters (85 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",

Argillic horizon - the zone from 18 to 200 centimeters (BAt, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4 & BCt horizons)\n3. Palehumult feature - clay does not decrease by as much as 20 percent of its maximum within 150 centimeters of the ground surface\n4. Particle-size control section - the zone from 18 to 68 centimeters, averages 30 percent clay, by weight, and 46 percent rock fragments, by volume.\nThe type location was moved in 2005 to better reflect the series concept."
