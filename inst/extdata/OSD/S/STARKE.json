Other similar series include Bayboro, Ellabelle, Kanapha, Palmetto, Pantego, and Surrency.  Kanapha and Palmetto soils have a mean annual soil temperature of more than 72 degrees F, and in addition Palmetto soils have a Bh horizon.  Bayboro and Pantego soils have an argillic horizon at a depth of less than 20 inches of the surface, and in addition Bayboro soils have B horizons containing more than 35 percent clay.  Ellabelle and Surrency soils have an argillic horizon at a depth of 20 to 40 inches of the surface.  In addition, Ellabelle soils have greater than 18 percent clay in the control section and Surrency soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the control section.  Pantego soils have 18 to 34 percent clay in the control section."

The understory consists of waxmyrtle, inkberry, fetterbush lyonia, swamp cyrilla, greenbriar, maidencane, brackenfern, sedges, and other water tolerant plants.  Areas of this soil provide cover for deer and are excellent habitat for wading birds and other wetland wildlife."

These soils would classify as Grossarenic Umbric Paleaquults if the subgroup were allowed in Soil Taxonomy and if chroma of 3 (due to color of sand grains) is waived as relates to aeric properties.\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nFL0497 STARKE      0-  2     -        -       -         -\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nFL0497 NONE   COMMON    -     APPARENT    -     60-60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nFL0497  0- 7  MUCK                    0-  0    -     0- 0    -\nFL0497  0- 7  MK-S MK-FS MK-LS        0-  0  92-100  2-10    -\nFL0497  0- 7  S FS                    0-  0  92-100  2-10    -\nFL0497  7-46  S FS                    0-  0  92-100  2-10    -\nFL0497 46-80  SL FSL SCL              0-  0  92-100 13-30    -\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
