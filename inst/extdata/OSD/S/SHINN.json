The base saturation by sum of cations is 60 to 75 percent throughout. The particle-size control section contains 35 to 65 percent rock fragments and clay content is 25 to 35 percent in the lower part. Depth to bedrock is 4 to 10 inches.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR. Chroma is 2 to 4 dry and 1 or 2 moist. It contains 15 to 35 percent rock fragments and reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt1 horizon has a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR. Value is 4 or 5 dry. Chroma is 3 or 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist.
