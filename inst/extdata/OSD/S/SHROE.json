  "OVERVIEW": "The Shroe series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from ignimbrite and lacustrine sediments influenced by small amounts of pyroclastic materials.  The Shroe soils are on valley fill terraces and fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
