  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shroe soils are on valley fill terraces and fan piedmonts at elevations of 1,525 to 1,895 meters.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from ignimbrite and lacustrine sediments influenced by small amounts of pyroclastic materials.  The climate is cool continental.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 350 mm; the annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 110 to 130 days."
