  "OVERVIEW": "The Scossa series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Scossa soils are on alluvial fans.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
