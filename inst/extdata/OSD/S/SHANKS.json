  "OVERVIEW": "The Shanks series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with moderate permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 25 to 90 percent in canyons and foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Balake, Beezee, Bluenose, Fordice, Jebe, Keuterville, Legall, Riverpoint and Sauter soils are very deep. Bluesprin soils have average annual soil temperatures of 59 to 63 degrees F. Jellico and Nashmead soils have O horizons. Tekoa soils have textures with less than 50 percent sand and a paralithic contact (fractured shale). Hunsinger soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to paralithic contact (strongly weathered basalt). Sienna soils have textures with less than 50 percent sand and are over basalt bedrock."
