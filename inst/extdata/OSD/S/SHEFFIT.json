  "OVERVIEW": "The Sheffit series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks and volcanic ash.  Sheffit soils are on lake plains and alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
