The soils formed in stratified fan or hillslope alluvium derived from granitic rock and minor areas of rhyolite.  Elevations range from 2000 to 5500 feet.  The climate is warm, semiarid continental.  The average annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches.  About one half falls as thundershowers in July, August and early September.  The remainder occurs as gentle rain and light snowfall in the late fall and winter.  The mean annual temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 280 days."
