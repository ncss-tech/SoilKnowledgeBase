Goldivide soils receive less rainfall and are moist for less than 20 days cumulative in some part of the moisture control section between July and October. Helendale soils have hues of 10YR or yellower and are noneffervescent above 40 inches.  Searchlight soils contain more than 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. Tray soils are moderately well drained."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sonoita soils are on fan terraces and hillslopes.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in stratified fan or hillslope alluvium derived from granitic rock and minor areas of rhyolite.  Elevations range from 2000 to 5500 feet.  The climate is warm, semiarid continental.  The average annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches.  About one half falls as thundershowers in July, August and early September.  The remainder occurs as gentle rain and light snowfall in the late fall and winter.  The mean annual temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 280 days."

A note in the series case file reads \"4-17-92 Sonoita Do not use this series. Appears to be within the Sahuarita concept. The Santa Cruz soil survey has this soil in a 12-16\" p.z. range site. The classification is quest. The 17 to 26\" layer appears to be Bw cambic and not argillic. The lower subsoil is buried. PDC.\"\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
