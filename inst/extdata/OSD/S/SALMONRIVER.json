The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 grams per cubic centimeter, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron is 2 to 4 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 20 to 35 percent for air dried samples. The particle-size control section has 15 to 27 percent field estimated clay, 15 to 40 percent sand, and has a weighted average of less than 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3, 4, or 6 moist and 4 or 6 dry.
