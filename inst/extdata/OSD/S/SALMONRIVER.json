The mean summer soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. and the mean winter soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 7 to 9 degrees F. These soils are usually moist, and are dry 0 to 30 consecutive days in the soil moisture control section. Depth to the placic horizon is 30 to 40 inches from the mineral soil surface. The particle-size control section has andic soil properties throughout. The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 grams per cubic centimeter, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron is 2 to 4 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 20 to 35 percent for air dried samples. The particle-size control section has 15 to 27 percent field estimated clay, 15 to 40 percent sand, and has a weighted average of less than 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3, 4, or 6 moist and 4 or 6 dry. It has weak or moderate structure.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 3 through 5 moist and 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3, 4, or 6 moist dry. It is medial loam, gravelly medial loam, medial silt loam, or very cobbly medial silt loam. It has weak or moderate structure.\nThe Cd horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is extremely gravelly loamy sand, extremely cobbly loamy sand, or very gravelly sandy loam. It has moist bulk density of 1.50 to 2.00 g/cc."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Salmonriver soils are on ground moraines on till plains. Slopes are 0 to 10 percent. The soils are formed in reworked alpine glacial till deposits derived dominantly from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks. Elevations are 500 to 600 feet. Average annual precipitation is 110 to 130 inches. Fog drip contributes to the effective precipitation totals. Average annual temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F. The frost-free season is 120 to 140 days."
