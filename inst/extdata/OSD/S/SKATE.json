  "OVERVIEW": "The Skate series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in coarse- textured glacial outwash and lacustrine  materials overlain by layers of volcanic ash and pumice.  Skate soils are on high outwash terraces and terrace breaks in mountainous upland drainages and are often eroded.  Elevations is l,500 to 2,500 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent on terraces and 50 to 90 percent on breaks.  Mean annual precipitation is about 95 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
