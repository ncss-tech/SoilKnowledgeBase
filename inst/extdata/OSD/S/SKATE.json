Depth to 3C horizon ranges from 38 to 46 inches.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of l0YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist and 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of l or 2 moist and dry.  It has 5 to 20 percent pebble-size pumice fragments.

It has l5 to 30 percent pebble-size pumice fragments.  This horizon is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe B22ir horizon has hue of l0YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 8 moist and dry.  It has 35 to 50 percent pebble-size pumice fragments.  This horizon is medium acid or slightly acid. The 2B2irb horizon has hue of l0YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It is loam, silt loam, or sandy loam.  This horizon has l5 to 25 percent rounded and subangular weathered pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  It is medium acid or slightly acid.  Some pedons have an intermittent 2A2b horizon.\nThe 3C horizon typically ranges from extremely gravelly loamy sand to extremely gravelly sand, but is gravelly silty clay loam in the lacustrine substratum phase."

Bellicum soils are medial-skeletal in the lower part of the control section.  Benham soils have pumice layers in the substratum.  Bisping, Choralmont, Palmich, Ramparter, and Thow soils are cindery throughout the substratum and have an umbric epipedon.  Cispus soils have a cindery control section and a mesic temperature regime.  Cotteral soils have a cryic temperature regime.  National soils have an umbric epipedon and a mesic temperature regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Skate soils are on glacial outwash and lacustrine terraces and terrace breaks in mountainous upland drainages at elevations of l,500 to 2,500 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  Landforms associated with these soils are commonly eroded.  These soils formed in coarse-textured outwash overlain by layers of volcanic ash and pumice.  In some areas, the substratum is composed of silty lacustrine deposits.  The climate is characterized by cool dry  summers and cool wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 80 to ll0 inches including snow.  Mean annual temperature is 42  to 44 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 90 to l20 days."
