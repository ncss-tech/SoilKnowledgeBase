  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 41 to 76 centimeters.  Rock fragments consist of 5 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 15 percent stones throughout.  Reaction of the surface layer is very strongly acid or strongly acid when not limed.  B horizon reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid and the C horizon is strongly acid or moderately acid.  Occasional remnants of siliceous limestone (ghosts), are a common feature of the C horizon of some pedons.  Fine earth texture is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam throughout.\nThe Ap horizon hue is 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  A horizons have similar hue, value ranges from 2 to 4 and chroma from 1 to 3.  Some pedons have thin E and Bh horizons below the A.\nBw horizon hue is 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium granular or subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable.\nThe Cd horizon hue is 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Structure is platy or the horizon is massive.  Consistence is firm or very firm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These include the Canterbury (T), Fullam, Lanesboro, and Stowe series.  Canterbury (T) soils developed in materials derived from granite, gneiss, and lighter colored schist. Fullam soils have a zone within 60 cm. of the soil surface that is, for more than 50 percent of the time, saturated throughout the 70 days following the spring solstice. Lanesboro soils formed in materials derived from slate and phyllite.  Stowe soils have an umbric epipedon and formed in materials derived from granite and schist.\nThe Ashfield, Buckland, Marlow and Paxton series are similar soils in related families.  Ashfield and Buckland soils are moderately well drained; Marlow soils have spodic horizons; and Paxton soils are warmer."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Shelburne soils are gently sloping to very steep soils on glaciated hills and ridges.  Slopes range from 3 to 50 percent.   The soils formed in a thin mantle of loamy glacial till underlain by dense, loamy, strongly acid to slightly acid till derived from micaceous schist and some siliceous limestone.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 965 millimeters to 1219 millimeters; mean annual air temperature is 6 to 8 degrees Celsius; mean annual growing season is 100 to 130 days."

Other soils on nearby landscapes include the Marlow and Colrain soils which both have a spodic horizon and the moderately deep Millsite soils on bedrock controlled ridges and knolls."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is typically moderately high or high in the solum and moderately low but may range to the very low end of moderately high in the dense substratum. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the solum and slow in the dense substratum."
