  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to soft shale bedrock ranges from 40 to 80 inches. The thickness of the solum ranges from 36 to more than 70 inches. The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches in thickness. The mollic epipedon includes the A horizon and usually the upper part of the Btg horizon. Reaction ranges from moderately alkaline to moderately acid, and is most acid in the upper part.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It commonly is silty clay loam, but some is silt loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2, except for higher chroma Fe masses. It is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay. Gravel content of the lower Btg horizon ranges from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe BCg horizon is mottled with hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is similar to the Btg horizon.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 6. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chancellor, Clarinda, Coatsburg, Edinburg, Haig, Mazaska, Minnetonka, Sacville, Terrabella, Sampsel, Virden, and Worthing series. None of these soils have a Cr (paralithic) horizon within 80 inches. In addition, Chancellor, Clarinda, Coatsburg, Haig, Mazaska, Minnetonka, Terrabella, and Worthing soils have mean annual air temperatures of less than 54 degrees F. Edinburg soils do not have coarse fragments in the series control section. Virden soils have carbonates in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sampsel soils are on gently to strongly sloping hillslopes. Slope ranges from 2 to 14 percent. These soils formed in residuum from alkaline or calcareous shales. In some places loess or pedisediment or glacial till or residuum from cherty limestone or colluvium and alluvium is present. Mean annual air temperature is 47 to 57 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 34 to 39 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Grundy, Lagonda, Polo and Snead soils in the series northern distribution and the Hartville and McGirk soils in its southern distribution. Grundy and Lagonda soils are somewhat poorly drained. Grundy soils are upslope from the Sampsel soils. Lagonda soils are on sideslopes higher or lower in the landscape than the Sampsel soils. Polo soils are well drained soils and are on ridgetops and on side slopes upslope from Sampsel soils. Snead soils are moderately deep and are on steeper slopes below the Sampsel soils. McGirk and Hartville soils have ochric epipedons. McGirk soils are on footslopes and Hartville soils are on stream terraces below the Sampsel soils."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: A similar soil, Sacville is to be established in south Missouri where on a lower slope position and more than 80 inches to soft shale bedrock. The concept of the Sampsel series will be to keep it on higher slope positions and have a paralithic horizon at a depth of 40 to 80 inches.\nDiagnostic horizons and surface features recognized in this series are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 16 inches (Ap, A and Bt horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 12 to 37 inches (Btg1, Btg2 and Btg3 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
