  "OVERVIEW": "The Sampsel series consists of deep and very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum from alkaline or calcareous shale or colluvium and alluvium from the shale and associated materials. These soils are on gently to strongly sloping uplands. Slope ranges from 2 to 14 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 54 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.",

The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches in thickness. The mollic epipedon includes the A horizon and usually the upper part of the Btg horizon. Reaction ranges from moderately alkaline to moderately acid, and is most acid in the upper part.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It commonly is silty clay loam, but some is silt loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2, except for higher chroma Fe masses. It is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay. Gravel content of the lower Btg horizon ranges from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe BCg horizon is mottled with hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is similar to the Btg horizon.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 6. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."

None of these soils have a Cr (paralithic) horizon within 80 inches. In addition, Chancellor, Clarinda, Coatsburg, Haig, Mazaska, Minnetonka, Terrabella, and Worthing soils have mean annual air temperatures of less than 54 degrees F. Edinburg soils do not have coarse fragments in the series control section. Virden soils have carbonates in the lower part of the series control section."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Grundy, Lagonda, Polo and Snead soils in the series northern distribution and the Hartville and McGirk soils in its southern distribution. Grundy and Lagonda soils are somewhat poorly drained. Grundy soils are upslope from the Sampsel soils. Lagonda soils are on sideslopes higher or lower in the landscape than the Sampsel soils. Polo soils are well drained soils and are on ridgetops and on side slopes upslope from Sampsel soils. Snead soils are moderately deep and are on steeper slopes below the Sampsel soils. McGirk and Hartville soils have ochric epipedons. McGirk soils are on footslopes and Hartville soils are on stream terraces below the Sampsel soils."

    "content": "REMARKS: A similar soil, Sacville is to be established in south Missouri where on a lower slope position and more than 80 inches to soft shale bedrock. The concept of the Sampsel series will be to keep it on higher slope positions and have a paralithic horizon at a depth of 40 to 80 inches.\nDiagnostic horizons and surface features recognized in this series are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 16 inches (Ap, A and Bt horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 12 to 37 inches (Btg1, Btg2 and Btg3 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
