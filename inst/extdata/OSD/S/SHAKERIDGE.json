  "OVERVIEW": "The Shakeridge series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed tephra and colluvium and residuum weathered from Lovejoy basalt.  Shakeridge soils are on backslopes and side slopes on basalt ridges on volcanic Sierra Nevada mountains.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches, (2032 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F, (11 degrees C).",
