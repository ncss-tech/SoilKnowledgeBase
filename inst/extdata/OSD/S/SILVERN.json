    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Plinthite ranges from 0 to 5 percent by volume in the argillic horizon.  Some pedons have a few dark concretions 2  to 6 mm in diameter throughout.\nThe A and E horizons ranges from 40 to 75 inches thick.  It has hue of 7.5YR and 10YR, value of 5 to 7, chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is very gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly loamy fine sand or very gravelly sand.  Coarse fragments consisting of siliceous pebbles mainly less than 1.5 inches in diameter and cobbles mainly 3 to 6 inches in diameter comprise from 35 to 90 percent by volume.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid through neutral.\nThe Bt horizon is typically mottled in shades of red, gray, brown, and white. Colors is dominant by hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 7, chroma of 1 to 8.  It is commonly very gravelly sandy clay loam or gravelly sandy clay loam and less commonly gravelly sandy loam.  Siliceous pebbles and cobbles range from 25 to 80 percent by volume.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid with base saturation of 20 to 70 percent,\nbut is 35 percent or more in some part within 72 inches of soil surface.\nThe BC horizon, when encountered, and the C horizon have colors in shades of red, brown, gray, and yellow.  Texture ranges from very gravelly sandy clay loam to gravelly sandy loam and is very strongly acid or strongly acid.  Coarse fragments comprise 15 to\n50 percent by volume."

The soils formed in ancient stream terrace or delta deposits of sand and gravel mainly\nassociated with citronelle geology.  Mean anual temperature is 70 degrees to 72 degrees F., average annual precipitation is 32 to 43 inches, and Thornthwaite annual P-E index is 42 to 64."
