Elevations are l,600 to 2,200 feet.  The climate is arid with hot dry summers and mild winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 6 inches; mean annual temperature is 64 to 68 degrees F., and the frost-free season is l70 to 250 days."

Localized areas have a somewhat higher water table as a result of excessive irrigation, conveyance losses, effluent seepage or seepage from nearby springs and seep areas."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The classification has been changed from a fine-loamy textural family to a fine-silty textural family.  The type location has been moved to the present site to better represent the current concept of the series.\nSpring soils were formerly classified as Typic Haplogypsids. The classification was again revised in March of 2003 recognizing the high sodium and adding the CEC activity class using the second edition to Soil Taxonomy. Competing series were not checked at that time. -ET\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 12/2015. The last revision to the series was 3/2003.
