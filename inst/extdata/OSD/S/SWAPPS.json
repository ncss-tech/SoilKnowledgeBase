  "OVERVIEW": "The Swapps series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on mesas, hills and mountains.  They formed in colluvium and residuum from limestone and shale.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 39 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 22 inches.",

The mean annual soil temperature is about 36 to 42 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at depth of 20 inches is about 52 to 58 degrees F.  The A horizon is noncalcareous and carbonates increase with increasing depth to very strongly calcareous in the lower Bk horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 to 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 6.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist and chroma of 3 to 6.  It ranges from gravelly and cobbly loam to gravelly and cobbly clay loam and has 20 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 8 dry, 3 to 7 moist and chroma of 2 to 8 inclusive.  It is gravelly, very gravelly and cobbly sandy loam to gravelly, very gravelly and cobbly clay loam."

    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly classified as Gray Wooded soils.  The classification has been changed from the Typic to Mollic subgroup based on moist color values of less than 4 after mixing the upper 6 inches of the soil.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the mineral\nsoil to a depth of 3 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 3 to 8 inches (Bt horizon)\nMollic features - a moist color value of less than 4 after mixing the upper 6 inches of the soil.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
