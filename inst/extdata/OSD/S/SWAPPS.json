  "OVERVIEW": "The Swapps series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on nearly level to gently sloping mesa tops and moderately steep to very steep sideslopes of mesas, hills and mountains. They formed in colluvium and residuum from limestone and shale.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 4 degrees C.",
