  "OVERVIEW": "The Secunda series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountain side slopes and ridges.  They formed in material from quartzite and phyllite of the Wallace Formation of the Belt supergroup that is blanketed by a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Slope ranges from 10 to 75 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 39 inches.",
