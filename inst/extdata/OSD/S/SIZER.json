Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent but are dominantly 6 to 30 percent. These soils are formed on the side slopes of cinder cones and at the base of cinder cones. The average annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 32 inches. The mean annual temperature ranges from about 40 degrees to 46 degrees F. The frost-free season ranges from 85 to 110 days."
