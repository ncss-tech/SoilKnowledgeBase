  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sanilac soils are on lake plains bordering the Great Lakes and the larger old inland lake beds and glacial drainageways in Wisconsinan age drift. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent and are plane or slightly convex. The soils formed in calcareous silty lacustrine or eolian sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 914 mm (28 to 36 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.7 to 8.9 degrees C (44 to 48 degrees F)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bach, Eastport, Gagetown, Guelph, Kingsville, Londo, Oakville, Parkhill, Pipestone, and Plainfield soils. The Sanilac soils are in a drainage sequence with the Gagetown and Bach soils. Gagetown soils are moderately well drained and occupy the more sloping areas. Bach soils are poorly drained or very poorly drained soils in nearly level areas or in depressions. Londo, Parkhill, and Guelph soils are formed in till and border Sanilac soils in some areas. Kingsville, Oakville, and Pipestone soils are sandy and occur on slightly higher elevations near the Sanilac soils. Eastport and Plainfield soils are on beach ridges that border areas of Sanilac soil."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is low to high depending on slope gradient. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderately slow or moderate depending on the texture and sequence of the layers."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Sanilac soils are cropped to corn, small grain, white beans, or hay. Other areas have been cleared and cultivated, but are now idle or in permanent pasture. Remaining woodlots have second growth stands of elm, red maple, willow, ash, and white birch. Native forest is mixed northern hardwoods and a few eastern white pine."
