  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sinton series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium. These soils are on nearly level, flood plains of rivers and streams on the coastal plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).",
