  "OVERVIEW": "The Smiley series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils formed in loamy glacial till on lake plains, till plains and moraines. These soils have moderate or moderately slow permeability. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 56 centimeters.",
