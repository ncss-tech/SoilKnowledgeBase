  "OVERVIEW": "The Sedwell series consists deep, well drained soils that were formed in alluvium and colluvium from limestone and shale.  These soils are on moderately steep to steep mountain slopes.  The mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is abou 17 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.  Depth to interbedded shale and limestone ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Calcium carbonate equivalent between depth of 10 and 40 inches averages more than 40 percent, including the lime in the coarse fragments of less than 20 mm. size. Coarse fragments in the control section range from 15 to 35 percent. The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 63 degrees F. In more than 7 out of 10 years the soils are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 80 consecutive days during the summer months, but are moist in all parts of the moisture control section about 55 percent of the time that soil temperature at 20 inches is above 41 degrees F., and are moist for 65 to 75 consecutive days during the 120 days after the winter solstice.\nThe Al horizon is very dark grayish brown, brown, dark brown or dark gray. It has value of 3 through 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. This horizon is neutral to mildly alkaline and is slightly to strongly calcareous.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 8 dry and 3 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is cobbly heavy silt loam, cobbly silty clay loam or very shaly silt loam with 25 to 35 percent clay. This horizon is mildly to strongly alkaline."
