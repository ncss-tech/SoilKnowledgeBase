  "OVERVIEW": "The Snowdog series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils  formed in colluvium weathered from acid sandstone, siltstone, and shale.  They are in coves, on side slopes and along drainageways in higher elevations of mountains. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and slow to moderately slow in the fragipan. Slope ranges from 3 to 55 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches, mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
