Depth to redoximorphic features range from 16 to 30 inches.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 45 percent by volume in the A, BA, E, BE, Bw, and BC horizons and from 20 to 75 percent in the Bx and C horizons. The control section averages less than 35 percent rock fragments by volume. The soil ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam or silt loam.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is loam or silt loam.\nThe BA horizon (or BE horizon, where present) has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam or silt loam.  It has weak or moderate, fine, medium, or coarse subangular blocky structure and friable consistence.\nThe Bx horizon has redoximorphic features and has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 8.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam or loam.  It is firm or very firm and brittle.\nThe C horizon (and BC horizon where present) has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Snowdog soils are on gently sloping to very steep slopes along drainageways and on concave or linear side slopes and benches on mountains.   Snowdog soils formed in medium textured colluvium from acid shale, siltstone, and sandstone. Slope gradients range from 3 to 55 percent.   The climate is humid continental with long winter snow cover. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 55 inches and is evenly distributed throughout the year.   Annual frost free days range between 90 to 130 days.  Elevation ranges from 3000 feet to greater than 4000 above sea level."
