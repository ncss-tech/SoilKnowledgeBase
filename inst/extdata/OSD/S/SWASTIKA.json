The mollic epipedon is 7 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam or silty clay loam.\nThe B21t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The B22t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5.  The Bt horizon is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam and has 35 to 50 percent clay.  In some pedons, lime in the B23tca horizon is segregated into fine threads on faces of peds or into fine irregular soft masses.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam."

Concho soils have a B2t horizon less than 16 inches thick.  Carnero, Cueva, and Sotella soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Cunico soils are calcareous within depth of 6 inches.  Falfa soils have hue redder than 7.5YR in the B2t horizon.  Partri soils have a calcic horizon immediately below the argillic horizon.  Remunda soils are noncalcareous in the argillic horizon.  Quivera soils have a gravelly solum that is 20 to 40 inches thick and contains 15 to 30 percent gravel."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Swastika soils are on uplands at elevations of 5,900 to 7,500 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 7 percent.  The soils formed in fine textured residuum weathered from shale.  This material is 4 to 10 feet thick over shale.  The climate is semiarid continental with mean annual temperature of 45 to 52 degrees F.  The mean annual rainfall is about 14 to 18 inches with more than 3/4 received during the period of April through September.  The frost free season is about 130 to 160 days."
