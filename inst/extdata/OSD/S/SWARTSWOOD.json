  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 70 inches. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 20 to 36 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 3 1/2 to 20 feet, or more. Low chroma redoximorphic features are usually present within the fragipan or deeper than 26 inches. The particle-size control section averages less than 55 percent silt plus very fine sand. Rock fragments are angular or subrounded sandstone, conglomerate or quartzite usually less than 4 inches in size but range through boulder size. Rock fragment content in individual horizons ranges from 3 to 40 percent by volume above the fragipan and from 15 to 60 percent in the Bx and C horizons. The soil ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid throughout, where unlimed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Undisturbed pedons typically have a thin A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons do not have an E horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6. Some pedons are redoximorphic concentrations below 26 inches. The Bw horizon has 5 to 18 percent clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 6. It usually contains both high and low chroma redoximorphic features. The Bx horizon has platy or very coarse prismatic structure with subangular blocky, platy or massive interiors. Faces of prisms have chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have friable or firm, gravelly sandy loam C horizons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bath, Braceville, Broadalbin, Ira, Lackawanna, Mardin, Rushford, Sodus, Wellsboro, and Wurtsboro series. Bath, Lackawanna, Mardin, and Wellsboro soils commonly have 55 percent or more silt plus very fine sand in particle size control section.  Braceville soils have stratified sand and gravel in the series control section. Broadalbin soils have rock fragments primarily of granite, gneiss, and dark shale. Ira and Sodus soils are moderately acid to neutral in the fragipan. Rushford soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower subsoil and substratum. Wurtsboro soils have low chroma mottles between 12 inches and the top of the fragipan or within a depth of 26 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Swartswood soils are nearly level to very steep. Slope ranges from about 0 to 35 percent in gradient. The soils developed in till derived largely from gray and brown quartzite, conglomerate and sandstone. Stones and boulders are common surface features in wooded areas. The climate is temperate and humid; mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 46 inches, mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F., and the frost-free season ranges from 130 to 150 days."

Arnot and Lordstown soils have thinner sola and do not have fragipans. Bath, Lackawanna, Mardin, and Wellsboro soils have more than 55 percent silt plus very fine sand in the particle-size control section. Chippewa and Volusia soils have more than 18 percent clay and dominant colors of 2 or lower chroma in the cambic horizon. Morris soils have reddish hues.
