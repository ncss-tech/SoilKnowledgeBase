  "OVERVIEW": "The Sunapee series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy melt-out till on hills and mountains in glaciated uplands. Estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the mineral solum and moderately high to very high in the substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1180 mm and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

(O, A, and E horizons).\nAlbic horizon - the zone from 8 to 13 cm (E horizon).\nSpodic horizon - the zone from 13 to 43 cm (Bhs, Bs1, and Bs2 horizons).\nAquic subgroup - redoximorphic features within a depth of 75 cm of the mineral soil surface (Bs3 and C1).\nOther features include a udic moisture regime, a frigid soil temperature regime, and a coarse-loamy particle-size control section (30-105 cm)."
