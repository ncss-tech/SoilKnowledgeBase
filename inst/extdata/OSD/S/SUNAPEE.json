  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sunapee soils are nearly level to very steep soils of the glaciated uplands, typically on backslopes and footslopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent, but is dominantly 3 to 15 percent. The soils formed in loamy melt-out till of Wisconsin age derived mainly from gneiss and schist. The climate is humid and cool. The mean annual precipitation is 790 to 1640 mm, and the mean annual temperature is 2 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free period ranges from 90 to 140 days."

Common associates are the well drained Becket soils and the moderately well drained Skerry soils that formed in coarser textured lodgment till. Colton, Adams, and Croghan soils are on nearby landscapes and developed in water sorted sands and gravel."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The use of the Sunapee series in 144A is in question. Sunapee has a frigid temperature regime which should not occur 144A.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the organic soil surface to a depth of 13 cm. (O, A, and E horizons).\nAlbic horizon - the zone from 8 to 13 cm (E horizon).\nSpodic horizon - the zone from 13 to 43 cm (Bhs, Bs1, and Bs2 horizons).\nAquic subgroup - redoximorphic features within a depth of 75 cm of the mineral soil surface (Bs3 and C1).\nOther features include a udic moisture regime, a frigid soil temperature regime, and a coarse-loamy particle-size control section (30-105 cm).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for Sunapee and similar soils is available through the National Cooperative Soil Survey Soil Characterization Database: http://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
