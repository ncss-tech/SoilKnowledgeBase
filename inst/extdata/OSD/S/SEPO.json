  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the base of the cambic horizon ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches thick and extends into the upper part of the B horizon in some pedons.  Organic matter content decreases irregularly with depth.  Carbonates are within a depth of 40 inches and commonly are present throughout the series control section.  These soils typically contain small snail shell fragments throughout.  The upper and middle parts of the series control section average between 27 and 35 percent clay.  Individual subhorizons range to as much as 42 percent clay.  Sand content ranges from 8 to 15 percent.  The lower part of the series control section averages between 18 and 30 percent clay and between 10 and 40 percent sand.\nThe upper part of the series control section (Ap and A horizons) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Redox concentrations are present in the lower part, commonly as masses of iron accumulation lining pores and root channels.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe middle part of the series control section (Bg and BCg horizons) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It dominantly is silty clay loam but thin subhorizons of silty clay are in some pedons.  It often is stratified in the lower part with textures of more sand and less clay.  Redox concentrations are present as masses of iron accumulation lining ped surfaces and pores.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe lower part of the series control section (Cg horizon) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is silty clay loam with strata of silt loam, loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Sand content averages less than 40 percent.  Redox concentrations are present as masses of iron accumulation lining pores.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."

Beaucoup soils lack free carbonates above a depth of 40 inches.  Blackoar, Ettrick, and Leshara soils average less than 27 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Bridgeson, Lummi, Sauvie, and Wapato soils are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for more than 45 out of the 120 days following the summer solstice.  Gorham soils average more than 40 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sepo soils are in abandoned shallow lakes on flood plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in slackwater sediments and are often stratified in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon.  The strata are typically loamy sediments.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 50 to 54 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 40 inches."

Ambraw soils average more than 15 percent sand and Titus soils average more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  The somewhat poorly drained Tice soils are on summits of broad rises."
