  "OVERVIEW": "The Seward series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are moderately deep or deep to dense till. These soils formed in 63 to 102 cm of sandy glaciolacustrine sediments or eolian material and the underlying till. They are on beach ridges and dunes on lake plains, wave-worked till plains, water-lain moraines, and till plains of late Wisconsinan age. Slope is typically 0 to 6 percent, but ranges to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.",

The very poorly drained, fine-textured Hoytville and Latty soils are on nearby flats and depressions. The somewhat poorly drained Tedrow, the moderately well drained Ottokee, and the well drained Spinks soils are on nearby dunes and ridges that have sandy sediments more than 152 cm (5 feet) thick."

The potential for surface runoff ranges from negligible to high, depending on slope gradient and thickness of the sandy materials. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very high in the upper part of the solum, moderately low in the lower part of the solum, and low in the substratum."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 66 cm (Ap, E horizons).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 66 to 102 cm (Bt, 2Bt horizons).\nDensic contact: at 102 cm (top of the 2Cd horizon).\nAquic conditions: low chroma iron depletions in horizons below a depth of 86 cm.\nThe 06/2002 revision limits the underlying material to till. The previous series concept allowed both till and lacustrine sediments in excess of 35 percent clay. Areas underlain with lacustrine sediments will be correlated as a new series during MLRA update activities. Additional field investigation is needed to collect characterization and supporting data to better define the series concept.\nUpdates to the pedon description were based on documented field observations. Further evaluation and collection of bulk density data is needed to better define the series concept.\nA stratified substratum phase and a deep to till phase have been recognized. These phases will be recorrelated to new series when their areas of use are updated."
