  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Moon series. Moon soils do not have a densic contact within a depth of 127 cm. Other soils in similar families include the Galen, Metea, Ormas, and Prissel series. Galen and Prissel soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 122 cm. Metea soils have less than 27 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Ormas soils have more than 8 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Galen series classifies as coarse-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs. Metea, Ormas, and Prissel series classify as loamy, mixed, active, mesic Arenic Hapludalfs."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Seward soils are on beach ridges and dunes on lake plains, wave-worked till plains, water-lain moraines, and till plains of late Wisconsinan age.  Slope gradient is typically 0 to 6 percent, but ranges to 18 percent. They formed in sandy glaciolacustrine sediments or eolian material and in the underlying till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1067 mm. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C. Frost-free period is 135 to 180 days. Elevation is 198 to 305 meters above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the somewhat poorly drained Rimer soils and the very poorly drained Wauseon soils that form a toposequence with the Seward soils, and the Hoytville, Latty, Ottokee, Spinks, and Tedrow soils. The Rimer soils are on less sloping or slightly lower areas, and the Wauseon soils are in depressions, drainageways, and on flats. The very poorly drained, fine-textured Hoytville and Latty soils are on nearby flats and depressions. The somewhat poorly drained Tedrow, the moderately well drained Ottokee, and the well drained Spinks soils are on nearby dunes and ridges that have sandy sediments more than 152 cm (5 feet) thick."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 46 to 91 cm (18 to 36 inches) between January and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff ranges from negligible to high, depending on slope gradient and thickness of the sandy materials. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very high in the upper part of the solum, moderately low in the lower part of the solum, and low in the substratum."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 66 cm (Ap, E horizons).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 66 to 102 cm (Bt, 2Bt horizons).\nDensic contact: at 102 cm (top of the 2Cd horizon).\nAquic conditions: low chroma iron depletions in horizons below a depth of 86 cm.\nThe 06/2002 revision limits the underlying material to till. The previous series concept allowed both till and lacustrine sediments in excess of 35 percent clay. Areas underlain with lacustrine sediments will be correlated as a new series during MLRA update activities. Additional field investigation is needed to collect characterization and supporting data to better define the series concept.\nUpdates to the pedon description were based on documented field observations. Further evaluation and collection of bulk density data is needed to better define the series concept.\nA stratified substratum phase and a deep to till phase have been recognized. These phases will be recorrelated to new series when their areas of use are updated.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory is available for pedon FT-13; from the Purdue University Soil Characterization Laboratory for pedon S74IN91-6; and from the National Soil Survey Laboratory for pedon S83IN-183-004.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
