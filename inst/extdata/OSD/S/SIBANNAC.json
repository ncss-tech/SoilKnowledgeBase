  "OVERVIEW": "The Sibannac series consists of deep, poorly drained soils on alluvial flats.  They formed in mixed alluvium weathered from andesite, breccia, or tuffs.  Slopes are 0 to 7 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
