  "OVERVIEW": "The Stonehouse series consists of very deep excessively drained soils. They formed in stratified sandy alluvium on flood plain-steps. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C. (55 degrees F.) and mean annual precipitation is about 84 centimeters (33 inches).",
