    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Amole (AZ) (T), Challenger (CA), Hypoint (NV), Livefire (CA), Orwash (NV), Redington (AZ), and Yellowrock (CA) series.  Amole soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section for more than 20 days cumulative from July through September.  In addition, they formed in alluvium derived from granitic rock sources and have a high content of biotite and magnetite.  Challenger soils have loamy sodic horizons with a SAR of 13 to 100 within 40 inches.  Hypoint and Orwash soils average 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Livefire soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments and sandy loam textures in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Redington soils have densic horizons within 30 inches.  Yellowrock soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section from May through November.  In addition, they average 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."
