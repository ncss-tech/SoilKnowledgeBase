  "OVERVIEW": "The Shawmut series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium, glaciofluvial deposits, colluvium, or till.  These soils are on plains, alluvial fans, stream terraces, escarpments, hills, mountains, and moraines.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
