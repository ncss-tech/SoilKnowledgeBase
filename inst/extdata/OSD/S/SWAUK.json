The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days during summer and fall.  The control section is 40 to 60 percent clay in the fine earth fraction 0 to 15 percent pebbles.  The upper part of the argillic horizon is clayey with an increase of at least 15 percent clay absolute, within a distance of 1 inch at the upper boundary.  Base saturation (by sum) is assumed to be 50 to 60 percent.\nThe A horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bt1 and Bt2 horizons have a value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  They are gravelly heavy clay loam, heavy clay loam, or clay.\nThe Bt3 and Bt4 horizons have a hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist and 5 or 6 dry.  They are clay or gravelly clay.  They have common and many distinct and prominent clay films on faces of peds and lining pores.
