  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 44 to 47 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  Solum thickness ranges from 14 to 31 inches, but loamy-skeletal material does not extend below a depth of 20 inches.  The upper part of the particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent rock fragments and the lower part averages 50 to 80 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 through 5 moist, 3 through 7 dry, and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and dry.  Some pedons lack an A horizon and have an E horizon.\nThe matrix of the Bs horizons has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 3 through 8 moist and dry.  Below 10 inches it is gravelly loam, very gravelly loam, very gravelly fine sandy loam, or very gravelly sandy loam.  It is very gravelly loamy sand in the lower part in some pedons.  Reaction is very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6 moist, 3 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 6 moist, 3 through 6 dry.  It ranges from extremely gravelly coarse sand to very gravelly loamy sand."

The Colton, Guardlake, Hermon, Masardis, Sheepscot, Stetson, Teneriffe, and Waiska soils have a udic moisture regime.  Etach and Marblemount soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Limking soils are slightly acid to neutral and have 35 to 60 percent granitic rock fragments in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Skykomish soils are on glacial outwash terraces at elevations of 400 to 1,800 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent. The soils formed in glacial outwash with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  Mean annual precipitation is 50 to 80 inches.  Mean January temperature is 33 degrees F, mean July temperature is 61 degrees F, and mean annual temperature is 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 100 to 140 days.  Growing season (28 degrees F) is 130 to 160 days."

Klaus soils are mesic and are cemented in the lower part of the spodic horizon.  Olomount soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Winston soils are mesic and are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal."
