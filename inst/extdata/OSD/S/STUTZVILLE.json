  "OVERVIEW": "The Stutzville series is a member of the fine-loamy, mixed, thermic family of Typic Salorthids. Typically, Stutzville soils consist of pale brown, dark brown, brown, and light yellowish brown, strongly alkaline horizons of silty clay loam and silty clay with salt accumulations.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is about 60 degrees F. and the soil temperature usually is below 47 degrees F. from in December until some time in March. The soil between depths of about 5 and 15 inches is usually dry all of the time from April until January and is moist in some part all the rest of the year. Under natural conditions these soils were saturated in most years to within 20 to 40 inches of the surface during the spring period or longer in years of unusually high runoff. Rock fragments are less than 1 percent. Some pedons have 0.5 to 5.0 percent salt other than gypsum in all horizons.  Other pedons, mostly because of reclamation, have as little as 0.1 to 0.2 salt to a depth of about 20 to 30 inches. The soils are light brownish gray to dark brown (lOYR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/3, 7/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 4/3, 4/4; 2.5Y 6/2, 6/4, 5/2, 5/4, 5/6). Some pedons have thin strata 1/4 to 2 inches thick of reddish color in hue of 5YR or 2.5YR.  Textures range from fine sand to silty clay and there is moderate to strong stratification. Dominant textures are fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam and silty clay loam. The 10 to 40 inch control section has 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand. Few to many fine crystals and segregations of salt, mostly sodium chloride and calcium carbonate are present in all or most horizons. Some pedons have some fine gypsum crystals."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Land soils are silty with less than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand Levis soils have more than 35 percent clay. Milham soils lack a salic horizon and the dominant accumulation is calcium carbonate. Panoche and Rosamond soils lack salic horizons, lack periods of saturation, and lack mottles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Stutzville soils are nearly level and are in a basin position at elevations of 1,800 to 2,000 feet. They formed in young alluvium from sedimentary rock sources. The climate is arid with hot dry summers and cold moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 6 to 7 inches. Average January temperature is about 43 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 75 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees F. The freeze-free season is 190 to 220 days."
