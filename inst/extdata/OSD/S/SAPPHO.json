  "OVERVIEW": "The Sappho series consists of deep to fractured hard bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks predominantly on dissected mountain slopes and moderate relief mountain slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 115 inches and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
