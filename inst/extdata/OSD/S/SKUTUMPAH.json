The soils formed in eolian deposits and slope alluvium derived from sandstone. Mean annual precipitation ranges is 13 to 17 inches (355 to 432 mm) and mean annual air temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F (8.3 to 11.1 degrees C). Frost-free period is 100 to 147 days. April, May, and June are driest months, with August through October and January through March as the wettest months."

Parkelei and Flugle soils are on backslopes and shoulders on structural benches and have argillic horizons.  The Royosa soils are formed in eolian sands on toeslopes and do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons.  Fraguni soils are on summits on structural benches, similar to the Skutumpah soils, but have argillic horizons."
