All of these soils have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y in the particle-size control section. Hawsley, Stumble and Tipperary soils have Ck horizons. Isolde soils are effervescent throughout. Kawich and Sundown soils have a lithologic discontinuity at depths of 38 to 120 inches. Tipper soils have paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Tuba soils do not have a buried natric horizon. Yenrab soils have an exchangeable sodium percentage of 15 to 30."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sheppard soils are on structural benches, dunes on structural benches, alluvial fans, and terraces at elevations of 3,500 to 6,400 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent. These soils formed from eolian material derived from sandstone. The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches. Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year with July and August being slightly wetter and June being slightly dryer. The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 57 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 190 days."

Barx soils have an argillic horizon and are more than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section. Deleco soils have a petrocalcic horizon. Fruitland, Monue and Nakai soils have a coarse-loamy particle size control section. Mota soils are very fine sandy loam or loamy very fine sand in the particle size control section and have a horizon of carbonate accumulations."
