  "OVERVIEW": "The Swanner series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in loess and silty alluvium and material weathered from rhyolite, andesite and other igneous rocks. They are on mountain slopes and ridges and have slopes of 0 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The Agassiz soils are somewhat excessively or excessively drained. The Anatone and Bocker soils have hue of redder than 10YR in the B horizons.   The Cedaran and Little Pole soils lack lime.  Falula soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder.  Foxol soils lack lime and have B horizons that are slightly or medium acid.  Rexmont soils lack horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation.  Van Wagoner soils lack lime and are neutral to medium acid in the lower part of the profile."

The Araveton, Ard, Hondoho, and Watercanyon soils lack lithic contact. Tetonia and Watercanyon soils formed in deep loess and are coarse-silty.  Araveton soils are on footslopes below the Swanner soils.  Tetonia soils are on loess mantled uplands above the Swanner soils.  Ard and Rammel soils are on mountain slopes where the overlying mantel is thicker.  The Watercanyon soils dominantly are on south and west-facing slopes of mountains and foothills where associated with Swanner.  Hondoho soils are on east-facing concave slopes and lower west-facing convex slopes where associated with Swanner."
