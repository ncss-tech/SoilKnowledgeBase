    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Agassiz, Anatone, Bocker, Cedaran, Falula, Foxol, Little Pole, Rexmont, and Van Wagoner series.  The Agassiz soils are somewhat excessively or excessively drained. The Anatone and Bocker soils have hue of redder than 10YR in the B horizons.   The Cedaran and Little Pole soils lack lime.  Falula soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder.  Foxol soils lack lime and have B horizons that are slightly or medium acid.  Rexmont soils lack horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation.  Van Wagoner soils lack lime and are neutral to medium acid in the lower part of the profile."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Swanner soils are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes are 0 to 80 percent.  They formed in loess and silty alluvium and material weathered from andesite and other igneous rocks.  The mean annual precipitation 12 to 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 70 to 110 days.  Elevation is 4,500 to 7,000 feet."

The Araveton, Ard, Hondoho, and Watercanyon soils lack lithic contact. Tetonia and Watercanyon soils formed in deep loess and are coarse-silty.  Araveton soils are on footslopes below the Swanner soils.  Tetonia soils are on loess mantled uplands above the Swanner soils.  Ard and Rammel soils are on mountain slopes where the overlying mantel is thicker.  The Watercanyon soils dominantly are on south and west-facing slopes of mountains and foothills where associated with Swanner.  Hondoho soils are on east-facing concave slopes and lower west-facing convex slopes where associated with Swanner."
