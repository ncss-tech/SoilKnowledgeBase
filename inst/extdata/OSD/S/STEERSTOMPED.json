  "OVERVIEW": "The Steerstomped series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Steerstomped soils are on stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
