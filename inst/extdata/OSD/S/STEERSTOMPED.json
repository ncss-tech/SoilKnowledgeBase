    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Steerstomped soils are on stream terraces. They typically occur on summit positions. They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,955 to 2,015 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
