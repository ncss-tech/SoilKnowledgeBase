  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Spade series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum weathered from calcareous weakly to strongly cemented sandstone. These very gently sloping to moderately sloping soils occur on interfluves and side slopes of hillslopes and ridges. Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent. The Mean annual precipitation is about 533 mm (21 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 16.7 degrees C (62 degrees F).",
