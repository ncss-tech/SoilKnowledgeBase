  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Texture of the surface horizon ranges from medium sand to very fine sand.  In areas adjacent to incised streams, the water table is much lower and a thin discontinuous A2 horizon has formed in places.  In some areas 6 to 8 inches of peat lies on the soil surface.  The C horizon is calcareous rather than alkaline in places."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Gustavus, Tolsona, Anchor Point, Moose River, and Killey series.  All but the Tolsona soils have strata of medium textured material.  The Tolsona soils are commonly gravelly and are perennially frozen at shallow depts.  The Gustavus soils have deeper water tables.  The Anchor Point and Moose River soils have thin A1 horizons and gravelly substrata, and are acid.  The Killey soils have chromas of 3 or more throughout the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils occur on nearly level plains built up by rivers originating in receding glaciers, and are commonly only a few feet above sea level.  The climate is maritime, with cool summers, mild winters, and high rainfall throughout the year."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Bartlett and Beardslee series, in addition to the Gustavus series.  The Bartlett soils are fine textured.  The Beardslee soils are well drained, very shallow over gravel, and have an incipient spodic horizon."
