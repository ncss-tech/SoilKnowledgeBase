  "OVERVIEW": "The Shadow series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and till derived from gneiss, schist, andesite and granite.  These soils are on moraines, mountains and hills.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
