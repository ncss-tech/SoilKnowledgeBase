Bonnick, Borobey, Emamount, Embal, Gardone, and Picturerock soils are very deep.  Frentera soils have cambic horizons and do not have firm, brittle horizons.  Oatmanflat and Tuffcabin soils are deep to buried duripans.  Wegert soils do not have firm, brittle horizons, have ashy sandy textures in the particle-size control section, and have subhorizons above the lithic contact with greater than 40 percent rock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stookmoor soils are on structural benches and plateaus.  These soils formed in volcanic ash and in slope alluvium derived from basalt.  Volcanic ash deposits are derived from ancestral Mt. Mazama and from the Newberry Crater volcano.  Elevations range from 4,300 to 4,800 feet.  Slopes are 1 to 50 percent.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches, the mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
