  "OVERVIEW": "The San Emigdio series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in dominantly sedimentary alluvium.  San Emigdio soils are on fans and floodplains and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 60 to 65 degrees F and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F at any time.  Soil between the depths of about 8 and 15 inches is dry all of the time from April or May until late October to early December and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.  The soil is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam to a depth of 40 inches or more.  Rock fragments, mostly fine pebbles, range to 15 percent, the amount tends to be greater in the lower part of the profile.  The 10 to 40 inch control section averages less than 18 percent clay.  There is weak to strong stratification and the organic matter decreases irregularly with depth.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3 or 6/4; 2.5Y 6/2 or 7/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4; 2.5Y 4/2, 3/2.  The organic matter is 0.5 to 1.5 percent.  It is mildly to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 6/6 or 7/6; 2.5Y 6/2, 7/2, 7/3, 7/4; moist colors are 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 4/6, 5/3, 5/4 or 5/6.  When moist values are 3, dry values are 6 or more.  Lime is disseminated throughout and many pedons have small amounts of fine segregated lime."

Anthony, Gila, and Ireteba soils have an aridic moisture regime.  Docas soils have a fine-silty control section.  Hanford and Honcut soils are noncalcareous and have a regular decrease in organic matter.  Maywood, Ramada, and Reiff soils are noncalcareous in the upper part or in all parts of the profile. Pico soils have a mollic epipedon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  San Emigdio soils are on alluvial fans, floodplains, and in narrow valleys at elevations of 100 to 2,000 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in moderately coarse textured alluvium dominantly from sedimentary formations.  The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.   Mean annual precipitation, all in the form of rain, is 10 to 20 inches.   Average January temperature is about 50 to 52 degrees F, average July temperature is about 70 to 74 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 60 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 200 to 280 days."

In future mapping, the Anthony series will probably replace soils placed in the San Emigdio series in the aridic regime.\nLast revised by the state on 2/91."
