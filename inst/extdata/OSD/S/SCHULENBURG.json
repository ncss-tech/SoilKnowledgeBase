Similar soils are the Cuero and Weesatche series.  Carman soils are calcareous to the surface and have redoximorphic features due to wetness.  Chickasha soils have a paralithic contact between 40 and 60 inches.   Lovedale soils have sola from 30 to 60 inches.  Milan and Teller soils do not have secondary carbonates.  Navina soils do not have carbonates within 36 inches.  Ravia soils contain 10 to 30 percent coarse fragments in the argillic horizon.  Stoneburg soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 and 40 inches.  Wynoka soils have a lithologic discontinuity between 30 to 60 inches of the surface.  Cuero and Weesatche soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick.  In addition, Weesatche soils have hyperthermic temperature regimes."
