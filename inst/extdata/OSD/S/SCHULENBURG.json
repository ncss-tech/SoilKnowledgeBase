Chickasha soils have a paralithic contact between 40 and 60 inches.   Lovedale soils have sola from 30 to 60 inches.  Milan and Teller soils do not have secondary carbonates.  Navina soils do not have carbonates within 36 inches.  Ravia soils contain 10 to 30 percent coarse fragments in the argillic horizon.  Stoneburg soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 and 40 inches.  Wynoka soils have a lithologic discontinuity between 30 to 60 inches of the surface.
