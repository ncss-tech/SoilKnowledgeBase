  "OVERVIEW": "The Saska series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice over glacial till and local colluvium.  Saska soils are on mountainsides and terraces and have slopes of 3 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
