The upper part of the 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.60 to 1.0, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  Depth to the 2C horizon ranges from 14 to 24 inches.  Soil reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid throughout.\nThe E horizon, where present, has value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  It is stony, bouldery, or very bouldery.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  It is sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, loamy sand or cindery fine sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.

These soils formed in volcanic ash underlain by glacial till and local colluvium. They are in a climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 35 to 65 inches.  Average January temperature is about 23 degrees F; average July temperature is about 66 degrees F; and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.  The growing season, at 28 degrees F, is 120 to 170 days."
