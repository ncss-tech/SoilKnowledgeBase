  "OVERVIEW": "The Stien series consists of very deep, well drained soils on glacial moraines and outwash terraces. They formed in glacial outwash and drift with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very rapid below. Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 28 inches and average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Series with a similar ashy-skeletal family include the Doe (T), Grenet, Kusu, Natkin (T), Pettijohn (T), Roundknoll, Stices, Twelvemile, and Yallani series. Doe soils have coarse sandy loam textures in the A and Bw horizons. Natkin soils have 2Bw horizons and have sandy loam textures in the 2C horizon. Pettijohn, and Twelvemile soils have fine sandy loam textures in the A and Bw horizons. Grenet soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Kusu soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Roundknoll soils have loamy sand textures in the A and Bw horizons. Stices and Yallani soils have loam textures in the A and Bw horizons."
