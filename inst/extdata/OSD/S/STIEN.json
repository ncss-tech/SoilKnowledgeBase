Series with a similar ashy-skeletal family include the Doe (T), Grenet, Kusu, Natkin (T), Pettijohn (T), Roundknoll, Stices, Twelvemile, and Yallani series. Doe soils have coarse sandy loam textures in the A and Bw horizons. Natkin soils have 2Bw horizons and have sandy loam textures in the 2C horizon. Pettijohn, and Twelvemile soils have fine sandy loam textures in the A and Bw horizons. Grenet soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Kusu soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Roundknoll soils have loamy sand textures in the A and Bw horizons. Stices and Yallani soils have loam textures in the A and Bw horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Stien soils are on glacial moraines and outwash terraces and outwash plains. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. These soils formed in glacial outwash and drift with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Elevations range from 1,700 to 2,800 feet. The climate is subhumid with cold wet winters and warm dry summers. The average annual precipitation is 22 to 32 inches and average annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

Natural vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, and western larch, with an understory of pine reedgrass, white spirea, baldhip rose, common snowberry, Saskatoon serviceberry, low Oregongrape, strawberry, and Oregon fairybells. Moist phases have a grand fir-twinflower plant community."
