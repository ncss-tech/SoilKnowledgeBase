It is usually dry  for 90 to 120 consecutive days.  It is moist in some part in the winter, spring, and late summer, and dry late May through early August.  Aridic moisture regime.\nSoil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.\nThe control section averages 2 to 12 percent total clay and 2 to 7 percent noncarbonate clay.  Rock fragment content is 0 to 20 percent, mainly gravel. Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, fine sand, loamy fine sand, channery fine sandy loam and gravelly loamy fine sand.\nDepth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches\nDepth to the calcic horizon is 3 to 15 inches\nReaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline throughout\nA horizon:\nHue: 7.5YR or lOYR\nValue: 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist\nChroma: 2 to 4\nBk horizons:\nHue: 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y\nValue: 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist\nChroma: 2 to 4\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 10 to 25 percent\nCarbonates: Common very fine and fine soft masses of calcium carbonate.  Thin lime coats and pendants are common on gravel fragments of sandstone where they occur in the lower part."

These soils formed in eolian material, slope alluvium and residuum from calcareous sandstone. Slopes are 2 to 10 percent. The climate is warm, arid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 9 inches.  Precipitation pattern:  Wettest months are July to October and driest months are December and June.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.; and the freeze free period is 120 to 160 days."
