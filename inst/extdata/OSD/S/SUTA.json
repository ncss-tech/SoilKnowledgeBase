These soils are usually moist, but the soil moisture control section is dry in all parts for 60 to 75 consecutive days within the 4 months that follow the summer solstice. Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent rock fragments and 18 to 23 percent clay. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist. Rock fragments in some pedons may include up to 15 percent stones and boulders."

Suta soils formed in colluvium from Simcoe basalt mixed with minor amounts of loess and volcanic ash. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and wet. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches. The average January temperature is 28 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 65 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 140 days."

Presher soils are on plateaus and footslopes.  Quiden soils are on plateaus and structural benches.  Satus soils are mountain slopes.  Lyville soils are on canyon side slopes."
