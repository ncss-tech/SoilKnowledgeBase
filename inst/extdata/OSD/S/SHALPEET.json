  "OVERVIEW": "The Shalpeet series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks and herbaceous plant materials. The Shalpeet soils are on floodplains.   Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
