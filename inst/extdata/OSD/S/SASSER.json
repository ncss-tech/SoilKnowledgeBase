  "OVERVIEW": "The Sasser series is a member of the coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid family of Aridic Calcixerolls. Typically, Sasser soils have grayish brown fine sandy loam Ap horizons. Pale brown fine sandy loam B horizons, and strongly calcareous fine sandy loam Cca horizons over loose sand and gravel at a depth of 38 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 degrees to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 59 degrees to 66 degrees F. The soils are usually dry and are dry for about 60 to 75 days in the summer. The upper 10 to 25 inches of the 10 to 40 inch control section are predominantly moderately coarse textured averaging less than 18 (mainly 8 to 13) percent clay, more than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand, and less than 15 percent rock fragments. Strongly contrasting textures of sand and gravel are at depths of 20 to 38 inches. When mixed to a depth of 7 inches, the soils have a mollic epipedon 7 to 12 inches thick. When mixed to a depth of 7 inches, the soil is calcareous to the surface. The depth to the calcic horizon ranges from about 10 to 16 inches. The A horizon has value of 5 to 5.5 dry and 3 to 3.5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 2.5. It is neutral to moderately alkaline. The B horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It has weak or very weak subangular blocky structure. The Cca horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. A subhorizon of the Cca horizon at least 6 inches thick contains 15 to 25 percent calcium carbonate. The B and C horizons range from mildly to moderately alkaline."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES AND THEIR DIFFERENTIAE:  These are the Bannock, Bock, Paesl, Presto, Stan, and Wapello series. Bannock soils are dominantly medium textured between depths of 10 to 20 inches over the sand and gravel. Bock soils are no calcareous to the surface, have a medium textured control section, and lack sand and gravel at depths of less than 40 inches. Paesl soils lack a calcic horizon and have more than 18 percent clay in the control section above the sand and gravel. Presto soils have loamy sand over silt loam or medium textures above a depth of 40 inches. Stan soils lack loose sand and gravel above a depth of 40 inches. Wapello soils lack a calcic horizon and loose sand and gravel above a depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  The soils are on level to gently sloping terraces at elevations of 4,200 to 5,500 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The soils formed in moderately coarse textured alluvium over stream deposited gravel and sand. The alluvium is dominantly from quartzite and sedimentary rock sources but contains minor rhyolitic, basaltic, and granitic material. The climate is semiarid with dry summers.  Average summers. Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches including 2 to 5 feet of snowfall. Average freeze-free period is 110 to 130 days."
