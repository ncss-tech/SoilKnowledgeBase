(Bk1, Bk2, Bk3 horizons)\nFluventic feature: strata of darker material indicates irregular decrease of organic carbon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL Data from Greer County, OK User Pedon ID# 02OK055001\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
