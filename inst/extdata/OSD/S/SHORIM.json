  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Shorim series consists of moderately deep to duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum from igneous rock flows with a component of calcareous eolian material. Shorim soils are on footslopes of hills.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F.",
