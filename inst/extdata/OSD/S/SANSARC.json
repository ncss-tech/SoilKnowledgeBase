  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to bedrock typically is 8 to 15 inches and ranges from 6 to 20 inches.  The soil typically is friable and easily dug with a spade.  The lower part of the C horizon and the underlying shale contain varying amounts of carbonates, gypsum and other salts. Plant roots are common or many under native grass, and in some pedons extends several inches into the shale.  The horizons above the shale average between 55 and 70 percent clay.  COLE is greater than 0.10.  Colors throughout, including mottling, are inherited from the shale.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value 4 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Where the color value is as dark or darker than 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist, the A horizon is too thin for a mollic epipedon.  The A horizon typically is clay but some pedons are silty clay.  It contains as much as 30 percent fragments of shale ranging from less than 2 mm to 10 mm in size.  It has fine and medium subangular blocky or very fine granular structure.  The upper 1/4 to 1/2 inch is a fragile crust or mulch of very fine granules.  The A horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay and contains as much as 50 percent fragments of shale by volume ranging from less than 2 mm to 15 mm in size.\nThe C horizon has 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y hue.  It is clay with 25 to 60 percent or more of fragments of shale by volume ranging from less than 2 mm to 25 mm in size.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon is bedded shale with a wide range of color.  It is soft in the upper part and becomes harder with depth.  It typically contains carbonates, but does not have carbonates in some pedons.  It ranges from medium acid to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Sansarc soils are on sloping to steep breaks of the dissected shale plains.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 60 percent or more.  The Sansarc soils formed in clayey residuum weathered from shale.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 45 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from about 16 to 26 inches, most of which falls in spring and summer."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dupree, Labu, Opal, and Promise soils. Dupree soils have cambic horizons, are very firm to extremely firm, and do not have carbonates.  Dupree soils are on less sloping landscapes along with the Sansarc soils.  Labu and Opal soils have bedrock within depths of 20 to 40 inches.  The Labu and Opal soils are on less sloping landscapes below and above the Sansarc soils.  Promise soils have bedrock at depths of 40 inches or more and are on the nearly level and gently sloping toe slopes below the Sansarc soils.  Sansarc soils are also associated with Rock outcrop."
