    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. These soils are usually moist in the moisture control section but are dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick. The particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.35 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, including 15 to 30 percent sand-size ash, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent, 15 percent or more fine sand or coarser, 0 to 10 percent rock fragments, and an apparent field estimated clay content of 4 to 10 percent. One or more subhorizons in the top 30 inches of the profile, including the surface horizon in all cases, has less than 75 percent base saturation by sum of cations. Depth to the indurated duripan ranges from 10 to 20 inches and depth to basalt is 20 to 40 inches. Some pedons have a 4 to 6 inch thick strongly cemented layer above the indurated duripan.\nThe Ap horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 dry.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist. Textures are ashy fine sandy loam or ashy loam and may contain up to 10 percent duripan fragments."
