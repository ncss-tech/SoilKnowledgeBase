  "OVERVIEW": "The Straber series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy and clayey residuum derived from mudstone of the Willis Formation.  These nearly level to moderately sloping soils are on broad ridges on inland dissected coastal plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1041.4 mm (41 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (69 degrees F).",
