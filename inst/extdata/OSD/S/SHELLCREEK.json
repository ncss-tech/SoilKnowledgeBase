  "OVERVIEW": "The Shellcreek series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils in depressions and on terraces , alluvial fans, and fan aprons.  Shellcreek soils formed in fine textured alluvium derived from clay shale and interbedded siltstone.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock exceeds 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 43 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F.  The particle size control section is clay, heavy clay loam, silty clay, and heavy silty clay loam with 35 to 60 percent clay and 45 percent or less total sand.  Rock fragments are uncommon but may range up to 5 percent rounded pebbles.  Some pedons have a thin lag gravel on the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  EC ranges from 2 to 8 mmhos.  ESP ranges from 4 to 20.  Reaction is moderately through very strongly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is clay, silty clay, heavy clay loam, or heavy silty clay loam.  EC ranges from 2 to 8 mmhos.  ESP ranges from 8 to 23.  Reaction is moderately through very strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon, when present, has the same color and texture range as the Bw horizon except that moist value may be 6.  The secondary carbonates are expressed weakly in most pedons because of the fine nature of the soil fabric so the identification of a Bk is difficult in some pedons.  EC ranges from 4 to 8 mmhos in most pedons but may range to 16 where salts more soluble than gypsum are present.  ESP ranges from 8 to 23.  Reaction ranges from moderately through very strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is clay, 3 - Shellcreek Series\nsilty clay, heavy clay loam, and heavy silty clay loam.  EC ranges from 4 to 16 mmhos.  ESP ranges from 8 to 30.  Reaction is moderately through very strongly alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shellcreek soils are on terraces, alluvial fans, fan aprons, and in depressional areas.  These soils formed in fine textured alluvium derived from clay shale with some influence from interbedded siltstone.  Slopes are simple and range from 0 to 3 percent.  Elevation is 6,500 to 7,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 7 to 10 inches of which about half falls as predominantly snow with some rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 36 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 60 to 90 days depending upon elevation, aspect, and local air drainage."
