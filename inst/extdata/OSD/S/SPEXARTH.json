  "OVERVIEW": "The Spexarth soil consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with colluvium and residuum from sandstone and siltstone. These soils are on mountain slopes and ridges. Slopes are 30 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
