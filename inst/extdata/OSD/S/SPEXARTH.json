The soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with colluvium and residuum from Naches and Manastash sandstone. The soft sandstone and siltstone fragments are light yellowish brown 2.5Y 4/4) fresh face with light gray (2.5Y 7/2) weathered surface. Most of the fragments can be broken by hand. The soils are in a climate with cool moist summers and cold wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 45 to 65 inches. The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F., and the average July temperature is about 61 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F. The frost-free season is 40 to 80 days."
