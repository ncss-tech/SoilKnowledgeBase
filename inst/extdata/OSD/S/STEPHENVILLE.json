  "OVERVIEW": "The Stephenville series consists of moderately deep, well drained, soils formed in material weathered from sandstone of Permian age. These soils are on very gently sloping to moderately steep side slopes of hills in the North Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A). Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 810 mm (32 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
