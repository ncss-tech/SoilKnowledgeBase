  "OVERVIEW": "The Snag series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till and glacial debris, volcanic ash and colluvium derived from andesite. Snag soils are on ground moraines on mountains and plateaus. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.",
