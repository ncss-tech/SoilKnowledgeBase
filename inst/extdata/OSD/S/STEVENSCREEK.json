The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about May 1 to November 1 (about 180 days) unless irrigated. The particle size control section is 25 to 100 centimeters and averages 27 to 35 percent clay, and 0 to 15 percent rock fragments, mostly gravel. The B horizon is lacking in clay films, clay increase is due mostly to alluvial deposition. Organic matter ranges from 1.5 to 4 percent to a depth of 23 centimeters.\nThe A horizon dry color is 10YR 5/3, 5/2, 4/3, 4/2, 4/1, 3/3, or 3/2. Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 3/2, 3/1, 2/2, or 2/1. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam. Clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent. Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent and are gravel size.

Conejo soils have a difference between mean winter and mean summer temperatures of more than 30 degrees F. Gazos soils have a lithic contact within 40 inches, (102 cm) of the surface. Carranza soils have extremely gravelly sandy clay loam C horizons within a depth of 40 inches, (102 cm). Reward soils are effervescent and have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches, (102 to 152 cm). Salinas soils have secondary carbonate accumulations in the C horizons and have chromas of 1 in the A horizons. Westfan soils have mean summer and mean winter temperatures that differ by more than 30 degrees F., and Westfan soils also have Btk and Ck horizons that are strongly effervescent and have disseminated carbonates or concretions, and have a water table between 36 to 60 inches, (91 to 152 cm) from November through April."
