  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sezna series consists of shallow over an indurated petrocalcic, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium mainly from limestone, with some calcareous shale and quartzite.  The Sezna soils are on ballenas.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sezna soils are on the crests and upper slopes of gently convex ballenas that are dissected by deep intermittent stream channels.  The exposed petrocalcic horizon is as thick as 15 feet in some pedons.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium, dominantly from limestone, calcareous shale, and quartzite.  Elevations are 3,400 to 4,200 feet.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The climate is arid with cool moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches; with relatively even distribution of precipitation with slight peaks in January and August.  Mean annual temperature is 58 to 62 degrees F., and the frost-free season is about 200 to 240 days."
