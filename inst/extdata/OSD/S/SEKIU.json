The solum is 14 to 18 inches thick. The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 48 to 50 degrees F.  The water table is at or near the surface from October to July.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR moist and dry, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.  It has angular blocky or prismatic structure.  This horizon is very strongly acid or extremely acid.  It has few to common distinct redox features.\nThe Bg1 horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y moist and dry, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is predominantly silty clay loam, but ranges to silty clay.  This horizon has angular blocky or prismatic structure.  It has common to many distinct or prominent redox features.\nThe Bg2 and Bg3 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5GY moist and dry, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  This horizon has common to many distinct or prominent redox concentrations."

The soils formed in fine alluvium within approximately 3 miles of the Pacific Ocean.   The climate is characterized by cool, moist summers and cool, wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 110 inches. Average January temperature is about 37 degrees F., average July temperature is about 57 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 180 to 210 days."

Hoko soils are skeletal and have a paralithic contact consisting of very compact glacial till at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Klone soils are medial-skeletal.  Tealwhit soils have chroma of more than 2 in some part of the upper 20 inches."
