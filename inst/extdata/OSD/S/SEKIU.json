The solum is 14 to 18 inches thick. The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 48 to 50 degrees F.  The water table is at or near the surface from October to July.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR moist and dry, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.  It has angular blocky or prismatic structure.  This horizon is very strongly acid or extremely acid.  It has few to common distinct redox features.\nThe Bg1 horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y moist and dry, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is predominantly silty clay loam, but ranges to silty clay.  This horizon has angular blocky or prismatic structure.  It has common to many distinct or prominent redox features.\nThe Bg2 and Bg3 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5GY moist and dry, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  This horizon has common to many distinct or prominent redox concentrations."
