Clay content as a weighted average in the loamy-skeletal alluvium ranges from 12 to 18 percent and 1 to 3 percent in the sandy-skeletal alluvium. Cementation of the Cr horizon ranges from extremely weakly cemented in the upper part to moderately cemented in the lower part. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral throughout.\nSome pedons have an Oa horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is very gravelly loam. Volume of rock fragments ranges from 35 to 60 percent as a weighted average. Volume of gravel ranges from 25 to 45 percent, volume of cobbles ranges from 10 to 35 percent, and the volume of stones ranges from 1 to 5 percent throughout.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is the very gravelly, extremely gravelly, very cobbly or extremely cobbly analogs of loam, coarse sandy loam, or sandy loam. Volume of rock fragments ranges from 35 to 80 percent as a weighted average.
