  "OVERVIEW": "The Soderbeck series consists of somewhat poorly drained soils which are deep to a paralithic contact over a lithic contact with sandstone. They formed in loamy-skeletal alluvium over sandy-skeletal alluvium on flood plains. Permeability is moderate in the loamy-skeletal alluvium, rapid or very rapid in the sandy-skeletal alluvium, and moderately rapid or rapid in the paralithic sandstone. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
