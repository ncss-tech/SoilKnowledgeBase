  "OVERVIEW": "The Savar series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from shale. These soils are on alluvial fans, and hillslopes. Slopes are 3 to 35 percent. The average annual precipitation is 15 to 19 inches, and the average annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 16 to 30 inches thick and typically includes the A and Bt horizons. Depth to free carbonates is 18 inches or more. The base of the argillic horizon is at 37 to 60 inches or more. In some pedons a C or Bk horizon is present. The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F. These soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section for 60 consecutive days between July 15 and October 1. Coarse fragments are typically absent, but shale chips may range up to 15 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Some A horizons appear as a light colored vesicular crust that darkens when moistened. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nTh Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is clay, clay loam, or silty clay. Clay content ranges from 35 to 50 percent. Sand content is less than 45 percent with over half being fine or very fine sand. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is clay, clay loam, or silty clay with 35 to 50 percent clay. Calcium carbonate equivalent averages 5 to 15 percent. Some pedons have few discontinuous pockets exceeding 15 percent. Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

The Beaverdam, Buckskin, Cimarron, Slights, Sudduth, Toponce, Wetopa, and Youman soils do not have horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation. The Cucharas soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact and do not have horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation. The Gourley and Heathcoat series have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick.  (This section needs to be re-written, after the classification was changed)"

In the transition away from \"borolls\", the series was incorrectly placed with Argicryolls.  The range in characteristics specifically states summer soil temperatures above 59F, which is clearly frigid criteria.\nPrevious classification:  Fine, smectitic Vertic Argicryolls\nUpdated classification:  Fine, smectitic, frigid Pachic Argiustolls\nThe soil temperature regime is frigid, and the soil moisture regime is Ustic."
