  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to the paralithic contact is 10 to 20 inches.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 80 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The percentage of surface covered with stones and cobbles ranges from about 5 to 15 percent.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 17 inches thick and includes all or a part of the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It is silt loam with 15 to 27 percent clay.  It has 5 to 35 percent stones, 15 to 35 percent cobbles and 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe BA horizon, when present, has colors similar to the A horizon.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay with 30 to 45 percent clay.  It has 0 to 5 percent stones, 15 to 35 percent cobbles and 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is 50 to 60 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments of which 0 to 3 percent are stones, 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 25 to 55 percent gravel."
