  "OVERVIEW": "The Spottedhorse series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum or alluvium over residuum derived primarily from shale.  Spottedhorse soils are on relict terraces, plateaus, fan remnants, broad ridges, and hillslopes.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

Depth to accumulations of calcium carbonate is 10 to 19 inches.  Rock fragments are commonly less than 5 percent channers but range from 0 to 10 percent.  The moisture control section is usually moist in in some or all parts in March through June.  The average annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is very fine sandy loam, loam or fine sandy loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay loam, clay, silty clay or silty clay loam.  It has 35 to 55 percent clay and 10 to 25 percent fine and coarser sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay loam, clay, silty clay or silty clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay.  It has 4 to 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture is commonly clay loam or clay and less commonly silty clay, silty clay loam, silt loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.  It has 4 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a C horizon.\nThe Cr horizon is commonly soft shale and less commonly interbedded shale and sandstone.  It is typically effervescent in the upper part and noneffervescent in the lower part, but may be noneffervescent throughout in some pedons."
