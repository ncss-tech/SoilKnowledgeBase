Elevations range from 4,000 to 4,200 feet.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 6 inches some of which comes as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 57 to 61 degrees F.  Mean July temperature is about 80 degrees F. and the mean January temperature is about 40 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 180 days."
