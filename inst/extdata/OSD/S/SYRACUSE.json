  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Syracuse soils are on low lake terraces.   These soils have formed in moderately coarse textured alluvium and lake sediments that are derived mainly from quartzite, limestone, and gneiss, but include material from many other kinds of rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 4,600 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 68 to 73 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 170 days."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; low or very low surface runoff; moderate or moderately rapid permeability (moderately high or high saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 3 and 4 feet (moderately deep or deep free water occurrence classes) April to September.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  One phase has the seasonal high water table at depths of 2 to 3 feet.  These soils are generally not susceptible to flooding, but one phase is susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods year-round."

Drained and reclaimed areas are used for growing tomatoes, corn, alfalfa, sugar beets, and small grains.  The native vegetation is mainly inland saltgrass, foxtail, alkali sacaton, and basin wildrye."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 11 inches (A horizon).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 21 to 60 inches (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 36 and 48 inches at certain times during normal years (part of the Bk2 horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (AC and Bk1 horizons and parts of the A and Bk2 horizons).\nThis revision of February 2006 updates the taxonomic class from Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Haplustolls based on the depth to the seasonal high saturation of more than 30 inches and on the assumed moisture regime being xeric instead of ustic.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 144-145, Table 11 of the Soil Survey of Davis-Weber Area, Utah.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
