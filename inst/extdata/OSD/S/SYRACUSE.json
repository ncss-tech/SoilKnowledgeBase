  "OVERVIEW": "The Syracuse series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived mainly from quartzite, limestone, and gneiss.  Syracuse soils are on low lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

These soils have formed in moderately coarse textured alluvium and lake sediments that are derived mainly from quartzite, limestone, and gneiss, but include material from many other kinds of rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 4,600 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 68 to 73 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 170 days."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 3 and 4 feet (moderately deep or deep free water occurrence classes) April to September.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  One phase has the seasonal high water table at depths of 2 to 3 feet.  These soils are generally not susceptible to flooding, but one phase is susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods year-round."

Drained and reclaimed areas are used for growing tomatoes, corn, alfalfa, sugar beets, and small grains.  The native vegetation is mainly inland saltgrass, foxtail, alkali sacaton, and basin wildrye."

The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
