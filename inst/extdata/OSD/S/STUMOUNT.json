  "REVDATE": "07/2016",
  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Stumount series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. The soils are on mountains and hills. Slopes are 8 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Jaybee soils have argillic horizons with 35 to 45 percent clay. Kreza soils have 15 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Meninik soils have textures that are dominantly silt loam and silty clay loam in the argillic horizon."
