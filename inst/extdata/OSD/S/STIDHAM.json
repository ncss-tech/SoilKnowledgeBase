  "STATES": "OK,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Stidham series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy sediments on terraces of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on broad nearly level to moderately sloping sandy reworked terraces in the Northern Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A).  Slopes are dominantly 0 to 3 percent but range to 8 percent.",

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 58 to 64 degrees F.; average annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 40 inches; Thornthwaite P-E indices ranges from 44 to 64.  Elevation ranges from 500 to 1200 feet.  Frost free days range from 200 to 230 days."
