  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 50 degrees F.  Exchangeable sodium exceeds 15 percent in all or part of the upper 20 inches of the profile, decreasing with increasing depth below 20 inches.  The soil is calcareous in all parts at depths between 10 and 40 inches.  Depth to the duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches but depths between 20 to 30 inches predominate.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 0 to 1 moist and dry.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of neutral, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 0 through 2 moist and dry.  This horizon commonly has many segregated lime masses and is strongly or very strongly alkaline.  It averages 35 to 45 percent clay and has stress cutans on surfaces of peds.\nThe duripan is weakly to strongly cemented, commonly platy, and has either some opal coatings on plate surfaces or a laminar opaline cap of 1 or 2 millimeters or both.  The duripan commonly is 4 to 24 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Scherrard soils are on low terraces at elevations of 4,050 to 4,725 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The soils formed in mixed sediments weathered mainly from tuffs and diatomite.  The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 15 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 46 to 49 degrees F., and the frost-free period is about 80 to 110 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Hosley soils and the Henley, Malin, and Lakeview soils.  Henley soils have an ochric epipedon and have loam or sandy loam texture in all parts of the profile.  Malin soils lack a duripan to depths of more than 60 inches.  Lakeview soils are nonsodic and also lack a duripan."
