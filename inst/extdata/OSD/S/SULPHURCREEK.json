Balon, Blancot, Decolney, Doakum, Fort, Mentmore, and Yenlo soils typically have hue yellower than 5YR in the Bt horizon.  Bowbac, Cerropelon, Cushman, Gaddes, Gapmesa, Hagerman, Pokeman, Pugsley and Spangler soils have lithic or paralithic contacts at depths between 20 and 40 inches. Buckle, Oelop, Palacid, Penistaja, Quagwa, Redpen, and Tamarindo soils have layers of secondary carbonate accumulations. Chilerojo soils are very deep to a densic horizon. Cumacho soils are deep to a paralithic contact. Chilojo and Hagerwest soils are inactive. Sundance soils have buried paleosol horizons. Teckla soils contain 35 to 70 percent porcelanite rock fragments below a 20 to 40 inch depth. In addition, the Bowbac, Cambria, Cushman, Decolney, Forkwood, Fort, Hagerman, Hiland, Olney, Pokeman, Potts, Pugsley, Spangler, Sundance, Tekla and Yenlo series reflect the soil forming factors of the Western Great Plains (LRR-G) and are more moist in May and June."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sulphurcreek soils are on stream terraces at elevations of 5,425 to 5,525 feet (1,645 to 1,675m). Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. Sulphurcreek soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches (229 to 330mm) which occurs as summer thunderstorms and light winter rain and snow. The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 54 degrees F (7.8 to 12 degrees C.). The average frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Sulphurcreek is the name of the creek that formed the stream terrace that contains the type location in the historic Fruita distict of Capitol Reef National Park. The Sulphurcreek soils exhibit unexpected soil development in the form of pronounced argillic horizons and structure. The landscape position (stream terrace) and parent material (alluvium) would suggest poorly developed soils. It is hypothesized that over 100 years of irrigation has increased the rate of pedogenSis. The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 3 to 12 inches (8 to 30 cm)  (Bt horizons)\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 3 inches (0 to 8 cm)  (Ap horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 3 to 12 inches (8 to 30 cm)  (Bt horizons)\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
