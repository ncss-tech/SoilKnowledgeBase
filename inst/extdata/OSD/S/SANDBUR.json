The particle size control section averages from 0 to 35 percent gravel.\nThe A or Ap horizon has color value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand, or their gravelly analogues. Reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR,  value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 6.  It is stratified loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, coarse sand or their gravelly analogs.  Reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon, where present, is similar in color and texture to the C horizon, but has from 35 to 75 percent rock fragments. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a 2Btb horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Series from similar families are the Kaintuck, Kickapoo, and Wideman.  Kaintuck soils have less sand and lack mollic colors.  Kickapoo soils have mixed mineralogy and have a mean annual soil temperature of about 47 degrees F.  Wideman soils are in the sandy particle size family."

These soils are formed in loamy alluvium.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 48 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 55 to 61 degrees Fahrenheit."

Kaintuck soils have less sand and lack dark colors, they are on similar positions along larger streams.  Cedargap soils have over 35 percent rock fragment in the control section and are on similar positions along smaller streams.  Lecoma soils have an argillic horizon and are on stream terraces and footslopes.  Huntington soils have less sand and are on flood plains adjacent to the Sandbur soils.  Racket soils have less sand and are moderately well to somewhat poorly drained.  They are on low stream terraces, meander scars, and depressional areas adjacent to uplands."
