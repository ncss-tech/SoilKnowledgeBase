  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the argillic horizon ranges from 24 to 60 inches below the soil surface.  These soils typically do not have rock fragments, but some horizons may have as much as 5 percent.  Free carbonates are absent to 80 inches or more.  Redox features are typically above a depth of 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum.  In areas where lime has been added, the reaction range includes neutral.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Undisturbed pedons have black (10YR 2/1) or very dark gray (10YR 3/1) A horizons ranging from 2 to 6 inches thick.  It is fine sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is fine sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is typically loamy fine sand or loamy sand, but the range includes fine sand or sand with increase of content of clay.  Fine sandy loam and sandy loam are included as lamellae and total less than 3 inches in thickness.\nThe E&Bt horizon has colors and textures similar to the E and Bt horizons.  This horizon consists of multiple lamellae bands with intervening E horizons.\nSome pedons have a C horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sand or sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils have plane to slightly concave slopes.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent.  The Soderville soils formed in deep sandy eolian or outwash sediments on outwash plains.  These sediments are of Wisconsin in age.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 30 inches.  Frost free days range from 90 to 145.  The elevation above sea level ranges from 670 to 1450 feet."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cantlin and Zimmerman soils.  The moderately well drained Cantlin soils occupy similar landscape positions, but do not have lamellae.  The excessively drained Zimmerman soils occupy higher landscape positions."

Soderville soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 2.0 to 3.5 feet at some time from April to June in most years."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 30 inches (Ap, E1, and E2 horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from 30 to 45 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons);\nThis soil was formerly classified as Aquic Glossoboralfs; however, lab data indicated a high base saturation.  Also, this soil was previously considered somewhat poorly drained with an apparent seasonal high water table.  Type location moved from Anoka County, MN. to Mille Lacs County, MN., 4/98 to better exemplify the series concept within the MLRA.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Soil Interpretation Record number is MN0206.  Refer to MAES Central File Code No. 1077 and 1547 for results of some laboratory analysis for a Soderville pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
