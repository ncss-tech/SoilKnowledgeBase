  "OVERVIEW": "The Shaser series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over residuum and colluvium from sandstone. Shaser soils are on mountains at elevations of 2,000 to 4,900 feet. Slopes are 30 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
