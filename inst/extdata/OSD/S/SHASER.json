The lower part of the particle-size control section has 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.\nThe E horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist. Reaction is slightly to moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5, 6, or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry, 3, 4, or 5 moist. Texture of the lower part is ashy fine sandy loam, gravelly ashy loam or very gravelly ashy loam. Structure is weak fine or moderate.

These soils formed in volcanic ash over residuum and colluvium from sandstone of the Swauk formation. They are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The average annual precipitation is 22 to 40 inches. The average January temperature is about 24 degrees F, the average July temperature is bout 67 degrees F, and the average annual air temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F. The growing season at 28 degrees F is 145 to 180 days."
