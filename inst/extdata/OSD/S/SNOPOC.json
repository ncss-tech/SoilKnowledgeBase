  "OVERVIEW": "The Snopoc series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks.  These soils are on mountain side slopes commonly in concave pockets.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
