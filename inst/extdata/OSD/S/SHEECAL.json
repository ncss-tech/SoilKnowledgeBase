  "OVERVIEW": "The Sheecal series consists of moderately deep to sandstone, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  Sheecal soils are on hills.  Slopes range from 10 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
