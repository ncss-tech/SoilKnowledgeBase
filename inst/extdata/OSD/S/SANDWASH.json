  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F.  A lithic contact is at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  Rock fragments consist of angular cobbles and channers.  The soil is typically calcareous to the surface.  Some pedons may be leached to a depth of 5 inches, but upon mixing the upper 7 inches all parts are calcareous.  Depth to the calcic horizon is 4 to 15 inches.  Calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth fraction averages 40 to 60 percent in the particle-size control section.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7, and 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe Bw and Bk horizons have a hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7, and 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent and are 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter.  Texture is channery loam, loam, or clay loam.  The Bw is absent in some pedons.\nThe 2Bk horizon has a hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8, and 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5.  Rock fragments are 35 to 65 percent and are 1-1/2 to 6 inches in diameter.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.  Textures are extremely cobbly loam or clay loam or extremely channery loam or very cobbly or very channery loam."
