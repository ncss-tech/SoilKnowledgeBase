The mean annual soil temperature is about 53 degrees F. These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for 90 to 105 consecutive days during summer and fall. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 70 percent angular basalt fragments and 23 to 35 percent clay in the fine earth fraction. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. The A2 horizon is very cobbly silt loam, very cobbly loam, very gravelly silt loam, and silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon, when present, has color value and chroma similar to the Btk1 horizon. It is very cobbly clay loam, very cobbly loam, or very cobbly silty clay loam.\nThe Btk1 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is very cobbly clay loam, very cobbly loam, very cobbly silty clay loam, extremely cobbly loam, extremely cobbly clay loam, or extremely gravelly loam. Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Btk2 horizon has value of 5 to 8 dry, 3 to 7 moist and chroma of 1 to 3 dry or moist. It is very cobbly clay loam, extremely cobbly clay loam, very cobbly loam, extremely cobbly loam or extremely gravelly loam. Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
