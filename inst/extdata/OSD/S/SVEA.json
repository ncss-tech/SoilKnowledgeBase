  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages between 18 and 28 percent clay and 14 to 45 percent fine sand or coarser.  It typically contains 1 to 10 percent by volume of rock fragments throughout.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to more than 30 inches in thickness and may include part or all of the Bw horizon.  Stony phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or neutral, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or less.  It is loam, silt loam or clay loam.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It typically is loam, but some is silt loam or clay loam.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  It has weak or moderate grades of prismatic or blocky structure.  The lower part of the Bw horizon contains a few mottles in some pedons.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y, less commonly 10YR or 5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It contains 15 to 25 percent calcium carbonate.  The carbonates are disseminated through the Bk horizon and segregated into few to common threads and masses.  Some pedons have BC or BCk horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It is friable or firm till.  Some pedons contain a thin stone or pebble band or thin lenses of sandy, silty, or loamy material at the boundary of the solum and the C horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aastad, Delette, Lankin, Lismore and Walsh series.  Aastad soils have Bt horizons containing 28 to 35 percent clay.  Delette soils are more acid, do not have carbonates in the solum and have a thicker mollic epipedon.  Lankin and Lismore soils do not have rock fragments in the upper part.  They formed in lacustrine sediments over till.   Walsh soils do not have Bk horizons and have coarse fragments that are primarily shale."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Svea soils are on level to moderately steep and slightly concave positions on till plains.  Slope gradients commonly are less than 6 percent but range from 0 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in calcareous till and local alluvium from the till.  The climate is cool subhumid.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 16 to 24 inches.  Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer."

Barnes soils are on convex and plane, well drained nearby areas and Hamlet soils are on nearby similar positions as Svea.  They have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick.  Buse and Langhei soils are on convex crests of steeper hills.  They do not have cambic horizons.  Hamerly soils are on slightly convex and smooth lower slopes on nearby areas surrounding depressions.  They have calcic horizons within depths of 16 inches.  Parnell, Quam and Tonka soils are in depressions. They are poorly or very poorly drained. In addition, Parnell and Tonka soils are fine and Quam soils are fine-silty."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well or moderately well drained.  Svea soils receive some runoff from higher parts of the landscape.  Runoff is negligible to high depending on slope.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderate or moderately slow in the C horizon.  A seasonal high water table is at depths of 3 to 5 feet at some time during the period of April through June in the moderately well drained phase.  It is at a depth of 4 to more than 6 feet for the same period in the well drained phase."
