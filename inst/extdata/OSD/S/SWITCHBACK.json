  "OVERVIEW": "The Switchback series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum and minor amounts of loess and volcanic ash.  Switchback soils are on mountainsides.  Slopes range from 3 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 to 30 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The control section averages 5 to 35 percent angular granitic pebbles and cobbles.  The upper 7 to 14 inches of the soil has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.15 to 1.40 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  Solum thickness is 10 to 24 inches.  Depth to the paralithic contact with weathered granodiorite ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  Chromas are 2 or 3 dry and moist.  Where values are 5 dry values are 4 moist.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and value of 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and moist.  Texture is gravelly fine sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or gravelly loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and value of 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  Texture is gravelly sandy loam, gravelly loam, or gravelly coarse sandy loam."

Slopes are 3 to 90 percent.  These soils are in a climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 to 30 inches.  The average January temperature is about 22 degrees F, average July temperature is about 67 degrees F, and the average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season 90 to 120 days, 50 to 65 days in Idaho."
