  "OVERVIEW": "The Ships series consists of soils that are very deep to clayey alluvium derived from calcareous shale formed from Permian age red bed sediments. They are moderately well drained and very slowly permeable.   These soils are nearly level to gently sloping and occur on flood plains of river valleys.  The slope range is 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1006 mm (40.0 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18.7 degrees C (66.0 degrees F).",
