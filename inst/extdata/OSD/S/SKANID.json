These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts above the paralithic contact for 75 to 90 days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 47 to 52 degrees F.  The soil has 10 to 55 percent pebbles but has more than 35 percent in the control section.  Reaction is moderately acid, slightly acid, or neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and 1 through 3 moist.  The lower part of the A horizon is gravelly loam or gravelly sandy loam.  Pebble content is 10 to 30 percent.  It has base saturation of 75 percent or less in some or all parts and cobble content is 0 to 5 percent..\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry and 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly coarse sandy loam.  It is 35 to 55 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles."

These soils formed in residuum from granite with a component of volcanic ash and loess. The climate is warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 24 inches.  The average January temperature is about 24 degrees F.; the average July temperature is about 65 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F.  The frost free season is about 100 to 180 days."
