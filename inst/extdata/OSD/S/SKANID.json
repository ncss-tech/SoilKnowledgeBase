  "OVERVIEW": "The Skanid series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from granite with a component of loess and volcanic ash. Skanid soils are on mountains and have slopes of 0 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts above the paralithic contact for 75 to 90 days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 47 to 52 degrees F.  The soil has 10 to 55 percent pebbles but has more than 35 percent in the control section.  Reaction is moderately acid, slightly acid, or neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and 1 through 3 moist.  The lower part of the A horizon is gravelly loam or gravelly sandy loam.  Pebble content is 10 to 30 percent.  It has base saturation of 75 percent or less in some or all parts and cobble content is 0 to 5 percent..\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry and 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly coarse sandy loam.  It is 35 to 55 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles."
