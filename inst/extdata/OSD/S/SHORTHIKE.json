Beehunt soils have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Burgi soils have 18 to 27 percent clay and 35 to 50 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Chambeam and Glean soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Climine soils are influenced by volcanic ash in the mollic epipedon and have an aridic moisture regime.  Sinker and Westbutte soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Ginser soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Lambring soils have 15 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have an aridic moisture regime.  Rondowa soils are influenced by volcanic ash in the mollic epipedon.  Smidale soils have mollic epipedons greater than 50 inches thick, have 20 to 27 percent clay, and are dominated by channers in the particle-size control section.  St. Anthony soils have 15 to 23 percent clay in the upper part of the particle-size control section and have lithologic discontinuities to loose gravel and coarse sand at depths of 20 to 36 inches from the soil surface.  Webfoot soils have redox concentrations and endosaturation within 24 inches of the soil surface.  Willynat soils have an aridic moisture regime."

They formed in till derived from mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granodiorite, andesite, schist, and gneiss.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 6,500 to 8,300 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 24 inches, the mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."
