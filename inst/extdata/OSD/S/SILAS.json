  "OVERVIEW": "The Silas series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Silas soils are on mountain valley fills and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is about 40 to 44 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is about 50 to 55 degrees F.  The organic carbon content ranges from 1 to 5 percent and decreases irregularly with depth.  The 10- to 40-inch control section is loam or clay loam stratified with lenses of very fine sandy loam and silt loam.  It averages 18 to 35 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent and are cobbles or gravel.  These soils are noncalcareous throughout. Some pedons have strata of sand and gravel below 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Reaction is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Reaction is slightly acid through mildly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevation is 7,000 to over 11,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 to 25 inches.  Where mean annual precipitation is less than 15 inches, additional moisture in the form of snowpack or runon from surrounding areas is available.  The mean annual temperature is about 32 to 44 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is about 50 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 60 to 90 days, but frost may occur at any time in higher elevations."
