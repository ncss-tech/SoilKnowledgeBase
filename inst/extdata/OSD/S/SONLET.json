    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture - Usually dry, moist in winter and early spring, dry in summer and fall; xeric moisture regime that borders on aridic.\nMean annual soil temperature - 42 to 46 degrees F.\nDepth to calcic horizon - 2 to 4 inches.\nDepth to bedrock - 10 to 20 inches to a lithic contact.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: 12 to 24 percent; Rock fragments: 35 to 65 percent, mainly pebbles.  Lithology of fragments are chert, limestone, dolostone, and sandstone.\nA horizon - Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.  When the upper 7 inches of the soil is mixed, the value is 6 or 7 dry and/or 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist.\nReaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 3 to 30 percent.\nBkq horizons - Value: 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist.\nChroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.\nTexture: Very gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam, extremely gravelly loam, or extremely gravelly sandy loam.  Some pedons have very stony loam, very cobbly loam, very cobbly loam, or extremely cobbly loam.\nReaction: Slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates: Occurs as coats on mineral grains, faces of peds, and rock fragments.\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 15 to 40 percent.\nSecondary silica: Occurs as coats on rock fragments."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sonlet soils are on hills, mountains, and ridges.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from chert, limestone, dolostone, and sandstone.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,200 to 7,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is l2 to l8 inches, mean annual temperature is 4l to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 80 to l00 days."
