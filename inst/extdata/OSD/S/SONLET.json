  "STATES": "ID,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sonlet series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from chert, limestone, sandstone, and dolostone.  Sonlet soils are on hills, mountains, and ridges.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Lithology of fragments are chert, limestone, dolostone, and sandstone.\nA horizon - Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.  When the upper 7 inches of the soil is mixed, the value is 6 or 7 dry and/or 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist.\nReaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 3 to 30 percent.\nBkq horizons - Value: 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist.\nChroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.\nTexture: Very gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam, extremely gravelly loam, or extremely gravelly sandy loam.  Some pedons have very stony loam, very cobbly loam, very cobbly loam, or extremely cobbly loam.\nReaction: Slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates: Occurs as coats on mineral grains, faces of peds, and rock fragments.\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 15 to 40 percent.\nSecondary silica: Occurs as coats on rock fragments."
