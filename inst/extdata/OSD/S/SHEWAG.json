  "REVDATE": "06/2011",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Shewag series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium or outwash.  These soils are on outwash plains, alluvial fans, fan remnants and stream terraces in valleys. These soils are subject to prolonged saturation from flood irrigation. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
