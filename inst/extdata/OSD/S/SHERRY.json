  "OVERVIEW": "The Sherry series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in loess or other silty deposits and in the underlying loamy glacial till or residuum weathered from igneous and metamorphic bedrock, or both.  These soils are on ground moraines. Permeability is moderately slow. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Reaction naturally ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper and middle parts of the solum but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.   Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the lower part of the solum and ranges from strongly acid to mildly alkaline in the substratum.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 7 percent in the loess or other silty mantle and from 2 to 35 percent in the 2Bt, 2BC, and 3C horizons.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the loess or other silty mantle and from 0 to 10 percent in 2Bt, 2BC, 2C, and 3C horizons.  A stony phase is recognized in some places.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or mucky silt loam.  Some pedons have an Oa horizon up to 7 inches thick.\nThe Eg horizon  has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to  6; and chroma of 1 or 2. texture is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is typically silt loam  but subhorizons in some pedons are silty clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y;value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 1 to 8.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe 2BC horizon has similar colors and textures as the 2Bt horizon.\nThe 2C or 3C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or 5BG; value of 3 to 6; chroma of 2 to 8.

The well drained Eaupleine and the somewhat poorly drained Milladore are on higher, better drained areas in the landscape and are in a drainage sequence with the Sherry soils.  The well drained Rozellville and somewhat poorly drained Meadland soils are on landscape positions similar to Eaupleine and Milladore soils.  However, these soils have formed in less than 15 inches of loess or other silty deposits and in the underlying loamy glacial till or residuum weathered from igneous and metamorphic rocks, or both.  Fenwood soils are well drained and Rietbrock soils are somewhat poorly drained.  They are on landscape positions similar to Rozellville and Meadland soils and formed in similar materials with bedrock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Altdorf and Dolph soils are on landscapes similar to those of the Sherry soils, but their sola formed in clayey residuum weathered from mica schist.  Mylrea soils are somewhat poorly drained and formed in loess or other silty deposits and in the underlying loamy glacial till and in the gravelly residuum weathered from coarse-grained igneous and metamorphic rocks."

The till appears to be what was stripped from the local residuum plus other transported materials.  When one is in either of the deposits is not always conclusive.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 8 inches (A1, A2);\nAlbic horizon - 8 to 13 inches (Eg);\nArgillic horizon - 13 to 38 inches (Btg1, Btg2, 2Bt3)."
