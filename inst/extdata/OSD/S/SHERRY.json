  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of soil development ranges from 30 to 67 inches.  Thickness of the loess or other silty mantle ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  Reaction naturally ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper and middle parts of the solum but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.   Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the lower part of the solum and ranges from strongly acid to mildly alkaline in the substratum.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 7 percent in the loess or other silty mantle and from 2 to 35 percent in the 2Bt, 2BC, and 3C horizons.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the loess or other silty mantle and from 0 to 10 percent in 2Bt, 2BC, 2C, and 3C horizons.  A stony phase is recognized in some places.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or mucky silt loam.  Some pedons have an Oa horizon up to 7 inches thick.\nThe Eg horizon  has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to  6; and chroma of 1 or 2. texture is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is typically silt loam  but subhorizons in some pedons are silty clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y;value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 1 to 8.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe 2BC horizon has similar colors and textures as the 2Bt horizon.\nThe 2C or 3C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or 5BG; value of 3 to 6; chroma of 2 to 8.  It has textures similar to the 2Bt and 2BC horizons, but silt loam is included where sand content is greater than 25 percent."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sherry soils are in depressions and drainageways on ground moraines.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Sherry soils formed in loess or other silty deposits and in the underlying loamy glacial till or residuum weathered from igneous or metamorphic rocks, or both.  The till is composed of the local residuum and other transported materials, and  the separation between till and residuum is not always clear.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 45 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Altdorf, Dolph, Eaupleine, Fenwood, Meadland, Milladore, Mylrea, Rietbrock, and Rozellville soils.  The well drained Eaupleine and the somewhat poorly drained Milladore are on higher, better drained areas in the landscape and are in a drainage sequence with the Sherry soils.  The well drained Rozellville and somewhat poorly drained Meadland soils are on landscape positions similar to Eaupleine and Milladore soils.  However, these soils have formed in less than 15 inches of loess or other silty deposits and in the underlying loamy glacial till or residuum weathered from igneous and metamorphic rocks, or both.  Fenwood soils are well drained and Rietbrock soils are somewhat poorly drained.  They are on landscape positions similar to Rozellville and Meadland soils and formed in similar materials with bedrock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Altdorf and Dolph soils are on landscapes similar to those of the Sherry soils, but their sola formed in clayey residuum weathered from mica schist.  Mylrea soils are somewhat poorly drained and formed in loess or other silty deposits and in the underlying loamy glacial till and in the gravelly residuum weathered from coarse-grained igneous and metamorphic rocks."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Field experience and investigation indicates that these soils have evidence of till overlying the residuum or have only till as the underlying deposit.  The till appears to be what was stripped from the local residuum plus other transported materials.  When one is in either of the deposits is not always conclusive.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 8 inches (A1, A2);\nAlbic horizon - 8 to 13 inches (Eg);\nArgillic horizon - 13 to 38 inches (Btg1, Btg2, 2Bt3).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to Soil Survey sample numbers 81WI073023 for NSSL data on the typifying pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
