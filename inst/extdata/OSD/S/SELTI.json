Kancan soils have secondary lime accumulation at 23 to 70 cm deep.  Mountainville, Pagari and Red Butte soils have mollic epipedons that do not extend into the argillic horizon.  In addition, Mountainville and Red Butte soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in argillic horizon.  Pagari soils have 60 to 75 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon and bedrock at 100 to 150 cm. Selti soils have 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section."
