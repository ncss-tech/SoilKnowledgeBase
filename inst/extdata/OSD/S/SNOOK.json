When described on 4/14/78 the soil was moist throughout.)  Sixty percent (60%) of the surface is covered with small, hard, angular pebbles.\nA--0 to 6 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, and few coarse roots; few very fine and fine interstitial pores; 10 percent hard, angular pebbles (2 to 25 mm); moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear wavy boundary.\nR--6 to 15 inches; hard, highly fractured sandstone, fractures are 1 to 2 mm in width and 5 to 10 mm apart, very few fine and coarse roots in the fractures.  Rock does not slake in water."

Clay content ranges from 10 to 25 percent.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 6/4, 6/3, 6/2, 5/4; 7.5YR 6/2, 6/4, 5/4, or 4/4. Moist colors are 10YR 4/4, 4/3, 3/3, 3/4; 7.5YR 4/2, 3/4, or 4/4.  It is sandy loam, loam, gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loam with less than 20 percent coarse and very coarse sand.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid."

Daulton soils have Bw horizons and are 11 to 20 inches deep to dark colored Mariposa slates. Exchequer soils have mostly 5YR hues, though ranges from 10YR to 5YR, are loams and silt loams, and have formed from metaandesitic schists and breccia.  Gaviota soils are 10 to 20 inches deep and have 10 to 18 percent clay.  Ocraig soils are neutral, have greater than 20 percent coarse and very coarse sand content.  Whiterock soils have mean annual soil temperature of 63 to 67 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTINGS",

The soils formed in material weathered from sandstone and shale.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 70 inches with occasional light snowfall in areas not within coastal influence.  Mean January temperature is about 40 degrees F in inland areas and 45 degrees F within coastal influence; mean July temperature is about 70 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is 55 degrees to 59 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 135 to 250 days."

Maymen soils have a cambic horizon and mesic soil temperatures."
