  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to soft bedrock and the paralithic contact ranges from about 4 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F.  These soils are not dry in all parts of the moisture control section three-forths of the time (cumulative) that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees or higher.  The particle size control section is a clay loam, sandy clay loam, or loam with 18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 50 percent silt, and 20 to 52 percent sand of which over 15 percent is fine or coarser sand.  The exchangeable sodium in the control section ranges from 15 to 30 percent when averaged.  Soft shale fragments range from 0 to 35 percent throughout, but these fragments break down upon pretreatment.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  EC ranges from 2 to 8 mmhos.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 5 to 30 percent.  Reaction is moderately through very strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Segregated lime is present and ranges from 8 to 14 percent.  This horizon is either too thin or lime content too low to meet the requirements of a diagnostic calcic.  EC ranges from 4 to 16 mmhos.  ESP ranges from 15 to 30 when averaged.  Salts more soluble than gypsum are common in some pedons.  Reaction is strongly or very strongly alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon consists of soft, platy or massive clay shale interbedded with thin lenses of sandstone.  The shale contains high amounts of calcium carbonates and lesser amounts of gypsum and more soluble salts.  The soil-bedrock interface is considered to be a paralithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Seaverson soils are rolling uplands and occupy summits, shoulders, backslopes, and footslopes of hills and ridges.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvial slopewash weathered from calcareous sodic shale.  Slopes are predominantly complex and range from 3 to 45 percent.  The climate is cool, semiarid with moist springs and dry summers.  Elevations range from 5,300 to 7,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The estimated frost-free season ranges from about 85 to 110 days depending upon elevation, aspect, and air drainage."
