    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. These soils are usually moist in the moisture control section but are dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The upper 7 to 14 inches of the profile has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.35 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, including 10 to 20 percent sand-size pumice, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent, 0 to 5 percent basalt rock fragments, and an apparent field estimated clay content of 5 to 14 percent.\nThe upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon averages 18 to 27 percent clay. The particle size control section contains more than 15 percent very fine sand or coarser. Depth to indurated lime-silica cemented duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches with basalt at depths of 30 inches or more. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 14 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 1, 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe 2Bt1 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist. Chroma is 3 or 4 dry and moist. Texture is silt loam or loam. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bt2 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, chroma is 4 or 5 dry and 3 or 4 moist. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bt3 horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist. Chroma is 3 or 4 dry and 2 through 4 moist. Textures are silt loam or loam."

Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches. The semiarid climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average January temperature is 26 degrees F. and average July temperature is 70 degrees F. Average annual air temperature is 47 to 49 F. Frost-free season is 110 to 165 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are a mollic epipedon from the surface to 10 inches and an argillic horizon from 10 to 28 inches. Volcanic glass counts of coarse silt and very fine sand are 26 and 19 percent from the surface to 8 inches. With the presence of pumice it is estimated that medium, coarse and very coarse sand is 50 percent or more volcanic glass and fine sand is 35 percent or more volcanic glass. The calculated (weighted) average of volcanic glass in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm. fraction is 32 percent. An indurated duripan occurs at 28 inches. The particle size control section is a zone from 10 to 28 inches (the 2Bt1, the 2Bt2 and the 2Bt3 horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL lab data is available for this pedon, number 90P1013, and for another pedon 89P0207.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
