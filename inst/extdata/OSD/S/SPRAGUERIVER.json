    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Spragueriver soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, watershed and recreation.  The soil supports both herbaceous dominated and forested plant communities.  The potential natural plant communities are the dry meadow plant series and the ponderosa pine/common snowberry flood plain plant association.  Common species in the herbaceous communities include Cusick's bluegrass, Kentucky bluegrass, Baltic ruxh, bulbous bluegrass, fewflower spikerush, meadow death camas and poverty rush.  The forested communities consist of an overstory of ponderosa pine and quaking aspen and an understory of common snowberry, Saskatoon serviceberry or rose spirea."
