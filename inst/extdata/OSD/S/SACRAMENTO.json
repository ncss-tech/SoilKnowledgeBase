  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Distinct or prominent mottles in a matrix with chroma of 1 or less occur less than 10 inches below the surface. Clay content to a depth of 40 inches or more ranges from 60 to 70 percent. Unless irrigated, cracks develop to a depth of more than 20 inches (51 cm) and cracks are 3/8 to 1 inch (9.5 to 25 mm) or more wide. Some slickensides may be present, but if present, are too few to intersect. Organic matter content is 3 to 5 percent in the upper 20 inches (51 cm), 1 to 3 percent above 40 inches (102 cm), and 0.5 to 1 percent above 50 inches (127 cm). The mean soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches (51 cm) is 64 degrees to 67 degrees F (32.5 to 19.4 degrees C).\nThe Apg, Ag and Ap horizons range from gray (5Y 5/1, N 5/ , lOYR 5/1) to dark gray (5Y 4/1, N 4/ , lOYR 4/1). Texture is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam. In areas where rice has been grown for many years, the chroma may increase to 2 with the above hues and values. This horizon ranges from medium acid to neutral in the upper 10 inches (25 cm). The reaction in any one area may be determined by water management and by soil amendments. Lower Ag horizons are mildly to moderately alkaline and slightly to strongly calcareous below a depth of 15 to 20 inches (38 to 51 cm).\nThe Cg horizon ranges from light gray to greenish gray in hues of 2.5Y, 5Y, 5GY or 5G. It is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam and has stratified horizons of loam and clay loam below 40 inches (102 cm) in some pedons.\nBuried A horizons are common. This horizon ranges from mildly to moderately alkaline and most pedons are calcareous in the Cg horizons."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sacramento soils are on nearly level basin floors in flood basins at elevations of near sea level to 82 feet (25 m). The soils formed in fine textured alluvium of mixed origin. The climate is dry subhumid, mesothermal with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 13 to 23 inches (33 to 58 cm). Average January temperature is 45 degrees F (7 degrees C), average July temperature is 75 degrees F (24 degrees C), and mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F (15.5 degrees C). Average frost-free season is over 275 days."

Clear Lake, Stockton and Willows soils have intersecting slickenside and other properties indicative of soil churning. Merritt soils have 18 to 30 percent clay in the control section. Omni soils have Mollic epipedons less than than 20 inches (51 cm) thick and have less than 35 percent clay in the control section. Capay soils have chroma of 2 or more and lack mottles associated with wetness. Columbia soils have pale brown color and less than 18 percent clay. Sycamore soils have less than 35 percent clay and the surface horizons are hard and massive."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Natural drainage is poor to very poor. Altered drainage occurs in reclamation districts and areas protected by levees, thus improving the drainage. The water table fluctuates between a depth of 0 inches to below 60 inches (152 cm). Surface runoff is very slow to slow. Permeability is slow. Subject to frequent overflow where not protected by levees or located within flood control systems."

Uncultivated areas now contain stands of willows, cottonwoods, scattered oaks, and grasses and forbs. Originally, vegetation consisted of tules, marsh grass, and other water-loving plants,"
