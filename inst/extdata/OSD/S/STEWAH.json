  "OVERVIEW": "The Stewah series consists of deep, well drained soils on side slopes, ridges, and shoulders of foothills and low mountains.  They formed in material from fine grained quartzites and siltite of the Libby and Striped Peak formations of the Belt supergroup that is blanketed by a thin mantle of mixed volcanic ash and loess. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Slope ranges from 15 to 55 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 45 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 37 inches.",
