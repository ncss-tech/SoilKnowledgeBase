  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 60 degrees to 65 degrees F.  The soil temperature is above 47 degrees F the entire year.  The difference between average July and average January soil temperature is 30 degrees to 33 degrees F.  Clay content in the 10 to 40 inch control section ranges from 40 to 60 percent.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.  Cracks 1 to 3 cm wide extend to 25 inches or more or the Cr horizon from June to October in areas not irrigated and are closed the rest of the year.\nThe A horizon has dry colors of 10YR 5/1 or 4/1 and moist color of 10YR 3/1, 2/1 or 3/2.\nThe Bss horizon has dry colors of 10YR 5/1 or 4/1 and moist colors of 10YR 3/1, 2/1, 4/1 or 3/2.  Masses of manganese accumulation and strongly cemented manganese nodules occupy 2 to 20 percent of the surface area.  It has common to many slickensides throughout.\nSome pedons have a calcareous C horizon above the siltstone."

Elevations are 20 to 80 feet.  Climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 17 inches.  Average January temperature is 77 degrees F and the average July temperature is 45 degrees F.  The mean temperature is about 60 degrees to 64 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 260-280 days."

In Sutter County, Subaco was described as having a paralithic (siltstone?) whereas in Butte County at the county line the soil clearly had a duripan. Subaco in Sutter County needs to be investigated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
