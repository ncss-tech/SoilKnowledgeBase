  "OVERVIEW": "The Shimo series consists of moderately deep, excessively drained soils with rapid permeability that formed in colluvium from granitic rocks and rhyolite. Slopes range from 25 to 90 percent in foothills and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
