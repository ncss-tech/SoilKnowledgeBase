  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  Depth to lithologic discontinuity, when present, ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Depth to hard bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Rock fragments of gravel and cobbles range from 0 to 35 percent in the solum and 0 to 50 percent in the substratum.  Reaction ranges, unless limed, from strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum and from  slightly acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 8.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 6.  Texture is variable, ranging from loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, to occasionally clay in the fine earth fraction."

Reaville soils have bedrock within 40 inches of the surface.  Conowingo soils contain serpentine.  Williamstown soils formed in glacial till.  Tuscola soils are stratified.  Haney soils contain carbonates.  Mount Lucas soils contain porcelainite channers.  Swampoodle soils contain fewer rock fragments and are moderately well drained.. Thackery soils contain carbonates in the lower solum.  Bogart soils formed in stratified outwash."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Scattersville soils generally occur on the footslopes of mountains.  They also occur in the heads of drainageways, on broad, nearly level, interfluves, on colluvial fans, and along drains.  Slope gradient commonly ranges from 1 to 4 percent, but may be as high as 8 percent.  The soils formed in loamy colluvium overlying mixed basic and acid Blue Ridge rocks.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 55 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches."

Purcellville, Philomont, Tankerville, Myersville, and Catoctin soils are on the adjacent convex uplands and are well drained.  Brumbaugh soils are on gently sloping mountain footslopes and colluvial fans.  Middleburg soils are in narrower upland drainageways."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  The majority of the Scattersville soils are in pasture or used for hay production.  Due to wetness, very little of the acreage has been developed for residential use.  A significant acreage is in woodland.  Where crops are produced on these soils, corn, wheat, and soybeans are the principle row crops.  Orchard grass/clover mixes are the principle hay crops.  Native vegetation is upland hardwood forest."
