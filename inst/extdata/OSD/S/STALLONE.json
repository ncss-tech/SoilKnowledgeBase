  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev.  DGS/RLB",
  "REVDATE": "04/2007",
  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Stallone series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slow permeable soils that formed in debris flow deposits derived from monzonite.  These gently to strongly sloping soils are on bouldery alluvial fans.  Slope ranges from 5 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
