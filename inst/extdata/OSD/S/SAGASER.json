Ahsahka soils (MLRA 43) are very deep soils on benches, hills, canyon sideslopes and footslopes and lack a paralithic contact. Buckbay soils (MLRA 21) are on hills and are 20 to 40 inches deep to paralithic contact and are formed in colluvium and residuum from andesite. Currymountain soils (MLRA 15) are on mountains and are 20 to 40 inches deep to paralithic contact. Elkheights soils (MLRA 44) are very deep soils on hillslopes formed in loess and alluvium over glacial till. Foehlin soils (MLRA 5) are very deep soils on alluvial fans and low terraces and are formed in alluvium from metamorphic, granitic and ultramafic rocks. Jauriga soils (MLRA 21) are on mountain sideslopes and toeslopes and formed in material weathered from andesite or basalt and have mean annual soil temperature from 47 to 52 degrees F. Picketpin soils (MLRA 10) are on foothills and lack a paralithic contact, are very deep and have an E and B horizon with lamellae in the subsoil. Tweedy soils (MLRA 18, 26) are moderately deep soils on uplands formed in material weathered from mica schist and igneous rocks"

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The soil temperature regime was originally classified as thermic.\nThe soil temperature regime was changed to mesic in 1998.  This was\ndone as a result of soil temperature studies on the Fresno County, California,\nWestern Part Soil Survey.\nThe original competing series before taxonomy change were the Ballard, Chualar, Gilroy, Pinto, Shimmon, Soper and Tehachapi series in the same family. Ballard soils lack a paralithic contact and have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Chualar soils lack a paralithic contact and have more than 20 percent coarse and very coarse angular sand. Gilroy soils have a lithic contact of basic igneous and metamorphic rock at 20 to 40 inches. Pinto soils lack a paralithic contact and reaction is neutral to medium acid in the surface and decrease, with depth to medium to strongly acid in C horizon. Shimmon soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches and lack coarse fragments below the A horizon. Soper soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Tehachapi soils lack a paralithic contact and have hue of 5YR in the B2t horizon.\nMajor Diagnostics Horizons:\n1. Mollic Epipedon--0 to 16 inches (A, Bt1)\n2. Argillic Horizon--16 to 34 inches (Bt2, Bt3)\n3. Paralithic Contact--50 to 52 inches (Cr2)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
