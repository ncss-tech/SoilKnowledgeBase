Content of volcanic fragments range from 5 to 15 percent, by volume in the A and Bwg horizons, from 10 to 80 percent, by volume in the Cg horizon.  Reaction ranges from moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown and black range from none to common.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, or their gravelly analogs.\nThe Bwg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2; or there is no dominant color and is multicolored in shades of gray, brown, and yellow.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, gray, and yellow range from few to many.  Texture is sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe upper part of the Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5G, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, gray, and yellow range from few to many.  Texture is sand, loamy sand or loam.\nThe lower part of the Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5G, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, gray, and yellow range from few to many.  Texture is sand or loamy sand."

They formed in regolith that consists of moderately fine material over coarse-textured sediments.  The climate is semiarid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 45 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 75 to 81 degrees F."

The very poorly drained Boqueron soils are on similar positions, have more clay in the control section, and do not have Cambic horizons.  The somewhat poorly drained Coloso soils are on adjacent flood plains and have more clay in the control section.  The very poorly drained Manglillo soils are on adjacent lower tidal marshes and are organic.  The excessively drained Redhook soils are on higher adjacent vegetated beaches and have sandy-skeletal control sections."
