  "REVDATE": "09/2006",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Serrano series consists of very deep, poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils on tidal flats in the coastal plain.  They formed in moderately fine material over coarse-textured sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

Content of volcanic fragments range from 5 to 15 percent, by volume in the A and Bwg horizons, from 10 to 80 percent, by volume in the Cg horizon.  Reaction ranges from moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown and black range from none to common.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, or their gravelly analogs.\nThe Bwg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2; or there is no dominant color and is multicolored in shades of gray, brown, and yellow.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, gray, and yellow range from few to many.  Texture is sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe upper part of the Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5G, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, gray, and yellow range from few to many.  Texture is sand, loamy sand or loam.\nThe lower part of the Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5G, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, gray, and yellow range from few to many.  Texture is sand or loamy sand."

The somewhat poorly drained Coloso soils are on adjacent flood plains and have more clay in the control section.  The very poorly drained Manglillo soils are on adjacent lower tidal marshes and are organic.  The excessively drained Redhook soils are on higher adjacent vegetated beaches and have sandy-skeletal control sections."
