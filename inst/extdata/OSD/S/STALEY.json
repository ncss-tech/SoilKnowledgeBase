The location of this pedon is in an area of Palouse silt loam, 7 to 25 percent slopes. The nearest Staley map unit delineation is more than 5 km from this location. This pedon is on a south-facing loess ridge. The formatting of this OSD was updated according to SSR1 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015).\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data--soil survey sample number 85WA075007; Whitman County, Washington; Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory pedon number 86P0069\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
