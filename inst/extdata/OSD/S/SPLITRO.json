    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon.\nMollic epipedon - from 0 to 20 cm (A horizon)\nCambic horizon - from 20 to 41 cm (Bw horizon)\nLithic contact - at 41 cm (R horizon)\nParticle-size control section - from 25 to 41 cm (part of the Bw horizon)\nNote: These soils were originally classified as Lithic Cryoborolls with an MAP of 508 cm (20 inches). In 1994 an MAP range of 457 to 635 mm (18-25 inches) was added to the OSD. Currently (04/2018), Splitro soils are mapped along the Rocky Mountains from southern Montana to central Colorado and encompass what appear to be both udic and ustic soil moisture regimes, as well as, both cryic and frigid temperature regimes. An investigation to determine correct moisture and temperature regimes for the extent of these soils is warranted.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
