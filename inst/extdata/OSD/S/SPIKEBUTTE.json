Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches. The particle-size control section has 35 to 60 percent clay. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and includes all or a part of the argillic horizon.  Depth to the argillic horizon is 3 to 12 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is ashy fine sandy loam, ashy sandy loam, or ashy loam.  It contains 0 to 20 percent mixed sedimentary gravel and 12 to 25 percent clay.  It has 5 to 20 percent glass and ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.2 to 0.4 percent.\nThe 2AB horizon (when present) has value 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  It contains 0 to 25 percent mixed sedimentary gravel and 15 to 30 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has a value of 5 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It is clay or clay loam.  It contains 0 to 20 percent mixed sedimentary gravel and 35 to 60 percent clay.\nThe 2BC horizon (when present) has a value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 dry and moist.  It is clay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.  It contains 0 to 15 percent mixed sedimentary gravel and cobbles and 20 to 40 percent clay."

The Deercreek, Eoj, Goodington, Harkers, Lynnbow, Norcan, and Rands series are all greater than 40 inches deep to a lithic or paralithic contact. Bridgecreek soils have the argillic horizon at a depth of 20 inches or more, are dry for 60 to 90 days following the summer solstice and lack the vitrandic properties in the surface horizon. Coser soils lack the vitrandic properties in the surface horizon and are dry for 60 to 90 days following the summer solstice. Mohocken soils lack the vitrandic properties in the surface horizon, have a 7 to 10 inch thick mollic epipedon and have 20 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Spikebutte soils occur on uplands at elevations of 4,500 to 5,300 feet.  Slopes range from 2 to 55 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from marine sandstone, limestone, shale, and other sedimentary rocks. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 46 degrees F.   The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
