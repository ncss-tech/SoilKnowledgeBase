It has less than 50 percent base saturation.\nTh B horizon is dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2), olive gray (5Y 4/2), and grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) and contains many strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), brown (7.5YR 4/4), dark brown (7.5YR 3/2), and yellowish red (5YR 4/8) mottles.  It is stratified silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam and contains lenses of loamy sand or sandy clay loam.  This horizon is slightly acid or neutral."

They are in a humid climate.  The average January temperature is 38 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 64 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is near 50 degrees F.  The frost free season is near 200 days.  The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches, most of which falls as rain during winter but each month of summer receives at least 1 inch of rainfall.  Snow is infrequent."
