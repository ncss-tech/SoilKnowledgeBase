  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Salter soils formed in stratified loamy and sandy deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 889 mm (28 to 35 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.2 to 8.9 degrees C (45 to 48 degrees F)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Sisson soils and the Colwood, Keowns, Kibbie, and Yahara soils. In some nearby areas on similar landscape positions and in similar deposits, the Salter soils are in association with the fine-loamy, well drained Sisson, somewhat poorly drained Kibbie, and poorly drained Colwood soils. The poorly drained Keowns and the somewhat poorly drained Yahara soils are in a drainage sequence with the Salter soils in other landscape situations. Keowns soils have grayer subsoil colors and Yahara soils have mollic epipedons."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nMost of the correlated acres of this series are outside the range in characteristics because they do not have carbonates. Only the 465 well drained acres correlated in Jefferson County have carbonates.\n4731 well drained acres are correlated in Columbia County without carbonates.\n2850 moderately well drained acres [redox at 97 cm (38 inches)] are correlated in Dane County without carbonates. In addition, these acres are a mollic intergrade.\n290 moderately well drained acres [redox at 107 cm (42 inches)] are correlated in Waushara County without carbonates.\nIn addition, there are 2180 acres correlated in Shawano County as Salter Variant because they have an argillic horizon (classify as frigid Haplic Glossudalf). These acres have carbonates. All correlated acres should probably be checked for\nan argillic horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon -\n0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches) (Ap); cambic horizon - 23 to 53 cm (9 to 21 inches) (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
