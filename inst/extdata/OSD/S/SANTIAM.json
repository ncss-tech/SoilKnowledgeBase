The soils formed in silty glaciolacustrine deposits over older weathered clayey alluvium or weathered basalt or sediments. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation of 40 to 60 inches. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. The mean July temperature is 65 to 67 degrees F. and the mean January temperature is 39 to 40 degrees F. The frost-free period is 165 to 210 days."

Jory and Salkum soils lack aquic conditions with chroma of 2 or less within 40 inches and occur on convex hills and terraces. Pengra soils are fine-silty over clayey and occur on adjacent foot slopes. Noti soils have aquic conditions with chroma of 2 or less above 10 inches and occur in depressions on terraces. Linslaw soils occur on depressions on terraces."
