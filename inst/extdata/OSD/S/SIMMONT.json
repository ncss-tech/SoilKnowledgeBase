  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Simmont series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in moderately coarse textured, noncalcareous, moderately thick sediments derived principally from the weathering of noncalcareous sandstones. They are on moderately to steeply sloping upland hills and ridges. Slopes are typically from 5 to 30 percent. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 16 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months. The average annual temperature is 40 degrees F., average summer temperature is 62 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick. The solum is 15 to 30 inches thick and depth to the lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The content of organic carbon ranges from 1 to 3 percent in the mollic epipedon and decreases uniformly with depth. The soil is 90 to 100 percent base saturated. The content of coarse fragments ranges from 35 to 80 percent and consists mainly of sandstone fragments more than 10 inches in diameter. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 degrees to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 70 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. It typically has granular or crumb primary structure, but has subangular blocky structure in some pedons. This horizon is soft to slightly hard and neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4. It usually has subangular blocky primary structure but has weak prismatic structure in some pedons. This horizon is typically extremely stony sandy clay loam but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 5 to 30 percent, and sand from 40 to 75 percent with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand. The content of rock fragments ranges from 35 to 80 percent and consists mainly of sandstone fragments more than 10 inches in diameter. This horizon is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon, if present, has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR. It is neutral to mildly alkaline."
