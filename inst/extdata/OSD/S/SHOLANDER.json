  "OVERVIEW": "The Sholander series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in glacial outwash over dense glaciomarine deposits. These soils are in valleys of drift plains. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
