    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sholander soils are in valleys of drift plains. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. These soils formed in glacial drift over dense glaciomarine deposits. Elevations are 0 to 500 feet. The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and mild moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 18 to 40 inches. Mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is about 200 to 240 days."
