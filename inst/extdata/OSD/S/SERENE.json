  "OVERVIEW": "The Serene series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with colluvium from granitic and low grade metamorphic rocks.  Serene soils are on mountain ridge crests and sideslopes.  Slopes range from 8 to 90 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 100 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Serene soils formed in a thin mantle of volcanic ash over residuum and colluvium from granitic and low-grade metamorphic rocks including granite, granodiorite, slate, and phyllite.  The climate is maritime influenced with cold, wet winters and cool, moist summers.  The mean January temperature is about 27 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 58 degrees F, mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is 70 to 130 inches, with a considerable portion of this being in the form of snow.  Growing season (28 degrees F) is 90 to 130 days."
