Rock fragments, including hard cinders, in the control section, average from 35 to 70 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature is 37 to 42 degrees F.  The soils have a udic soil moisture regime.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 moist and 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 0 through 2 moist or dry.  There is tonguing of this horizon into the B horizon in some pedons.  It is moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR moist and 5YR or 7.5YR dry; value of 2 through 5 moist, 3 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry.  There is up to 15 percent black organic staining up to 2mm in diameter in some pedons.  Texture is ashy sandy loam, or ashy loam modified by from 15 to 55 percent coarse fragments including hard cinders.  Structure is weakly to strongly expressed and is granular, subangular blocky, or angular blocky.  It is slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  Dark stains are lacking in some pedons.  Texture is ashy loamy sand or ashy sandy loam.  Coarse fragments range from 30 to 60 percent.  It is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7 moist and dry, and chroma of 2 through 6 moist and dry.  Rock fragments are angular and granitic and range from 40 to 75 percent. Reaction is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nA 2C horizon may be present in some profiles, and has chroma of 4 or 6 moist or dry.  It is very gravelly coarse sand or extremely cobbly loamy sand.  It is slightly acid to strongly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Serene soils are on mountain ridge crests and sideslopes 3,000 to 6,000 feet in elevation.  Slopes range from 8 to 90 percent.  Serene soils formed in a thin mantle of volcanic ash over residuum and colluvium from granitic and low-grade metamorphic rocks including granite, granodiorite, slate, and phyllite.  The climate is maritime influenced with cold, wet winters and cool, moist summers.  The mean January temperature is about 27 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 58 degrees F, mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is 70 to 130 inches, with a considerable portion of this being in the form of snow.  Growing season (28 degrees F) is 90 to 130 days."

Spukwush soils are ashy over loamy.  Shuksan soils have a paralithic contact with dense glacial till at 20 to 40 inches.  Klapatche soils have a Bhs horizon with a ratio of free iron to carbon of less than 0.2."
