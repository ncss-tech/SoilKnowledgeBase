  "OVERVIEW": "The Solis series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in soft sandstone.  These soils are on gently sloping to hilly uplands.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on broad rolling uplands. The interbedded sandstone and shale materials from which these soils formed have been uplifted and tilted, forming ridges with common sandstone ledges and outcrops above badlands.  Slopes are convex and are mostly 1 to 10 percent, but range up to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches, most of which occurs during the summer months.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 68 to 72 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 240 to 280 days.  Elevation ranges from 1,800 to 4,100 feet."

Studybutte soiols contain more than 35 percent rock fragments and occur on hills and mountains.  Tornillo soils are very deep and occur on alluvial flats."
