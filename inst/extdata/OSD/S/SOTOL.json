  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sotol series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium from monzonite.  These strongly sloping to steep soils are on mountain flanks and bases.  Slope ranges from 15 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
