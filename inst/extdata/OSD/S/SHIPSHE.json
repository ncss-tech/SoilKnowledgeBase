  "STATES": "IN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Shipshe series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy outwash material. They are moderately rapidly permeable in the subsoil and very rapid in the underlying material. These soils are on terraces and have slopes ranging from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum and the depth to free carbonates typically are about 30 inches but range from 20 to 40 inches. The sand fraction throughout the solum and underlying material is dominantly medium and coarse.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is commonly sandy loam or loam and less commonly silt loam. The A horizon ranges from neutral to medium acid. Some pedons have an AB or BA horizon. Coarse fragments range from 2 to 15 percent by volume.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is commonly gravelly or very gravelly sandy loam or gravelly sandy clay loam and subhorizons range to gravelly loamy sand, gravelly clay loam, sandy loam, loam, and sandy clay loam. It averages between 14 and 30 percent clay, 35 to 70 percent sand, and 35 to 60 percent by volume of gravel. It is slightly or medium acid. In some pedons the Bt or BC horizons extend as tongues 6 to 14 inches wide into the 2C\nhorizon from 6 to as much as 24 inches.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is stratified gravelly or very gravelly sand and sand."

The Shipshe soils formed in loamy gravelly outwash materials overlying stratified gravelly sand and sand that is calcareous. Sand throughout the solum is dominantly medium and coarser. Gravel is dominantly medium in size. The mean annual precipitation varies from 28 to 42 inches, and the mean annual temperature varies from 48 to 56 degrees F."
