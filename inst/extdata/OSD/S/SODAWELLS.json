  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates ranges from 0 to 8 inches, but some in some horizons carbonates are intermittent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent, but are typically less than 5 percent.  Organic matter content decreases irregularly with depth.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam or silt loam.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.  EC ranges from 0 to 4 mmhos/cm.  Where colors have value of 3 moist and 5 or less dry and chroma of 3 or less, the horizon is too thin, has too little organic carbon, or is stratified and does not qualify as a mollic epipedon.  Some pedons have an AC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or very fine sandy loam, and is stratified with loam, silt loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand or sand.  Skeletal material occur below 40 inches in some pedons.  Reaction is slightly to strongly alkaline.  EC ranges from 0 to 8 mmhos/cm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sodawells soils are on flood plains and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  The soils formed in stratified, dominantly moderately coarse textured recent stream alluvium originally weathered from sedimentary rock. Elevation is 3,500 to 5,800 feet.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 17 inches with over half falling in April, May, and June and less falling in the months of July, August, September, and October.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 44 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."

Pathfinder and Rockypoint soils occur on similar positions as Sodawells soils.  Pathfinder soils are sandy and Rockypoint soils are fine-loamy."

These soils are subject to rare to frequent flooding for very brief or brief periods during prolonged, high intensity storms in the spring and early summer.  The soil has a wet soil moisture status at a depth of 3 to 5 feet at some time during the period April through July in the moderately well drained phase."
