  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sig series consists of shallow or very shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from granite.  Sig soils are on mountain slopes and structural benches.  Slopes range from 15 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",

Mineralogy is assumed mixed rather than isotic because reaction ranges as high as moderately acid (no lab data is available).\nActivity class presumed from the general trend of other soils in the area.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
