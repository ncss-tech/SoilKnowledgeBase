  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 53 centimeters (21 inches) (A and BA horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 53 to 102 centimeters (21 inches to 40 inches) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Existing laboratory data show that soils sampled as Sassafras to include soils with a weighted average clay content in the argillic horizon that ranges from about 16 to 25 percent. Also, included are soils that have sand or loamy sand within 40 inches of the surface and border on a strongly contrasting family. The Sassafras series, however, is thought to be dominantly fine-loamy with a weighted average clay content of about 21 percent in the argillic horizon.\nCharacterization data is available from the NSSL for the following pedons: 57DE001006.  Data for closely related Sassafras and Downer taxajuncts include the following pedons: 57DE001011; 59PA04501; 59PA045012; 74MD047001; 77MD029007; 79VA001001; 85NJ033010; 92DE003004; 93MD04768; 93NJ005001; 93NJ005002; 93DE003002. At, this time due to limited laboratory characterization data to support the present classification of the Sassafras series, a future 3-HAM MLRA Benchmark Sampling Project is planned.\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
