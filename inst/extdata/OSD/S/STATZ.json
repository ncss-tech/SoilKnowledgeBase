They are warmer than 41 degrees F from March 15 to November 1, and they are dry in this period after July 1.  Depth to the duripan is 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The solum has 0 to 15 percent gravel and 5 to 15 percent clay.  The solum has a phosphate retention of 15 to 25 percent, 10 to 30 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate, and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron of 0.4 to 0.8 percent.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent stones and cobbles.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bkq horizon is sandy loam or loam.  It may contain durinodes or lack brittleness in some pedons.  It is noncalcareous to strongly calcareous.\nThe duripan commonly extends into the bedrock fractures."
