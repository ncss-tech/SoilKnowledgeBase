The climate is subhumid with cool\nwet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual temperature is\n45 to 52 degrees F, the mean January temperature is 35 degrees F,\nand the mean July temperature is 68 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches.  The frost-free period is 100\nto 160 days."
