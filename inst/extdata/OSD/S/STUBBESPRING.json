  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Stubbespring series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluviums and residuum from granitoid rocks. The Stubbespring soils are on hills. Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 millimeters (8 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",
