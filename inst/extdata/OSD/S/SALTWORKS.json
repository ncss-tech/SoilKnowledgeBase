  "OVERVIEW": "The Saltworks series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Saltworks soils are on drainageways, alluvial flats, or playas on basin floors.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 305 mm (12 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 2.8 degrees C. (37 degrees F.).",
