The soil has a Udic soil moisture regime.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of  2 or 3.  It is gravelly silt loam, gravelly loam or loam.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is very gravelly loam or very channery loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a C horizon."
