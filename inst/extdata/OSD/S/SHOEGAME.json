  "OVERVIEW": "The Shoegame series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from quartz diorite and sandstone.  Shoegame soils are on low stream terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
