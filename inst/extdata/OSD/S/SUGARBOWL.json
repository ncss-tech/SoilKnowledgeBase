These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive following solstice. The 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.60 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 30 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 2.0 to 4.0 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 98 percent, and 15 bar water retention of 8 to 12 percent. Base saturation (NH4OAc) is estimated to be less than 50 percent. Rock fragments in the particle-size control section range from a 0 to 15 percent. Below the particle-size control section rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 19 inches thick. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 4 to 6 dry. Texture is ashy loam ranging to gravelly ashy loam in the lower part."

The soils formed in colluvium derived from basalt mixed with volcanic ash. Summers are cool and dry; winters are cold and wet with a snow cover from December through April. The mean annual precipitation is 45 to 55 inches. The mean January temperature is 23 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 63 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 75 to 95 days."
