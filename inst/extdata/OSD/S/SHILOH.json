    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chehalem, Clamo, Derrynane, Okoboji, Peotone, Rantoul, Wabash, Zoe, and Zook series.  Chehalem soils are warmer and significantly wetter in winter.  Clamo and Zoe soils have carbonates within a depth of 39 inches.  Derrynane soils are formed in similar materials over Wisconsinan diamicton, have less average clay in the underlying material, and have soil temperature control section average of less than 55 degrees F.  Okoboji soils average more than 10 percent sand in the particle size control section.  Peotone soils have soil temperatures that average less than 55 degree F. and have more available phosphorous in the upper 3 feet (see remarks). Rantoul soils average 45 to 65 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Wabash soils average 46 to 60 percent clay in the particle size control section and are formed in alluvium on floodplains.  Zook soils formed only on floodplains or low terraces in alluvium and receive an average of 24 to 37 inches of precipitation per year."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shiloh soils typically are in depressions on Illinoisan age ground moraines. The slopes typically are concave with gradients of 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in silty or clayey local alluvium or loess and the underlying Sangamon age paleosol. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 43 inches, and mean elevation ranges from 400 to 700 feet above MSL."

The somewhat poorly drained Ipava soils and the poorly drained Sable and Virden soils have mollic epipedons less than 24 inches in thickness and are on nearby loess covered ground moraines.  Newberry soils have albic and argillic horizons and average less than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Patton soils on nearby lake plains have a fine-silty control section."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained and poorly drained.  The potential for surface runoff is negligible.  Permeability is moderately slow. In the undrained condition these soils have an apparent water table within 6 inches below the surface year round in normal years.  Where drained, the water table is within 1 foot below the surface at some time between January and June in normal years. These soils pond water as much as 1 foot deep after heavy rains for brief to long periods of time."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nmollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of about 48 inches (Ap, A, and BA horizons);\ncambic horizon - (the presence of soil structure and gleyed colors) the zone from about 19 inches to 68 inches (BA, Bg1, Bg2, and Bg3 horizons);\naquic conditions- endosaturation - positive reaction to alpha-alpha dipyridyl at depths between 16 and 20 inches is assumed; also chroma of 1 or less in all horizons to depth of 80 inches and redox concentrations in the lower mollic epipedon;\nWith this update, the Shiloh series was resampled and described to 80 inches. Other changes include a clarification of the setting and separation of this soil from the Peotone series.\nSome areas on flood plains that flood frequently for long periods are mapped Shiloh. These areas are no longer within the defined limits of the Shiloh series and they need to be re-evaluated. MLRA 115 and MLRA 108 update activities will investigate areas of Shiloh soils on flood plains to determine if Zook series better fits the concept of soil genesis and morphology.\nThe differentiae needed to clearly separate the Shiloh series from Peotone series are now based on soil temperature properties. Peotone soils were established nearly 20 years after the Shiloh series was established.  Both Shiloh and Peotone soils are in depressional parts of broad interfluves.  As mapped in Illinois, Peotone soils are on the Wisconsinan ground moraine and Shiloh soils are on the Illinoisan ground moraine.  The landscape setting and soil forming processes that produced the Shiloh soils are discussed in a paper by Follmer, L. R., 1982:  The geomorphology of the Sangamon surface:  its spatial and temporal attributes, Space and Time in Geomorphology; pp 117-146.  Paper contributed by the State Geological Survey Division of the Illinois Department of Energy and Natural Resources.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Partial samples from this pedon (81IL049004), Effingham County, Illinois and additional reference samples from Macon County, Illinois and Jasper County, Illinois are available at NSSL, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
