The somewhat poorly drained, fine-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal Imano soils have a mollic epipedon and are on lower flood plains. The somewhat poorly drained, sandy Willowbrook soils have a mollic epipedon and are on lower flood plains. Willowbrook soils have coarse-loamy textures in the upper 14 to 26 inches (36 to 66 centimeters). The somewhat poorly drained, sandy Yaggy soils are on lower flood plains and are typically finely stratified with loamy textures above 19 inches (48 centimeters)."

They differ by having sandy textures and a seasonal high water table.\nCharacterization data is available on this pedon (90KS155004; NSSL lab pedon # 90P923).

We are using the 1990 characterization pedon as the TP (90KS155004).  This revision involved so many changes from the original OSD that we are sending up a whole new file (ie no  marks).
