  "OVERVIEW": "The Saxman series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy alluvium. These soils are on high flood plains in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F (13 degrees C), and mean annual precipitation is 29 inches (74 centimeters). Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.",

Willowbrook soils have coarse-loamy textures in the upper 14 to 26 inches (36 to 66 centimeters). The somewhat poorly drained, sandy Yaggy soils are on lower flood plains and are typically finely stratified with loamy textures above 19 inches (48 centimeters)."
