Chutum soils are in the Sonoran Desert (MLRA 40) have a moisture regime with almost equal (bi-modal) summer-winter distribution of precipitation. Deltajo soils are moderately deep to sedimentary bedrock. Laverkin soils have 45 to 60 percent fine and coarser sand. Turney soils have weakly cemented Bk horizons. Weedpatch soils are in the San Joaquin Valley (MLRA 17) receive mostly winter precipitation and are usually dry from April through November."

Slopes are nearly level to sloping with gradients ranging from 1 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in calcareous medium textured mixed alluvial deposits influenced by red sandstone and shale.  The annual precipitation is about 8 to 10 inches with a summer maximum.  The mean annual temperature is 58 to 63 degrees F."
