  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sotim series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous medium textured mixed alluvial deposits influenced by red sandstone and shale. Sotim soils are on fans along upper portions of the basin floor. Slopes are 1 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

Chutum soils are in the Sonoran Desert (MLRA 40) have a moisture regime with almost equal (bi-modal) summer-winter distribution of precipitation. Deltajo soils are moderately deep to sedimentary bedrock. Laverkin soils have 45 to 60 percent fine and coarser sand. Turney soils have weakly cemented Bk horizons. Weedpatch soils are in the San Joaquin Valley (MLRA 17) receive mostly winter precipitation and are usually dry from April through November."
