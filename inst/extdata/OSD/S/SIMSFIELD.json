These soils are usually dry in the moisture control section for one-half to three-fourths of the time when the soil temperature is over 41 degrees F. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. The upper 14 to 20 inches of the solum has moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.35 g/cc, 30 to 60 percent volcanic glass content, including 5 to 20 percent pumiceous sand, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent, 0 to 10 percent gravel, and an apparent field estimated clay content of 5 to 14 percent. The lower part of the solum has 5 to 20 percent volcanic glass, 0 to 10 gravel and 9 to 18 percent clay. Depth to a weakly or moderately cemented duripan is 20 to 40 inches. Depth to secondary carbonates is 12 to 25 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 moist and a chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe AB horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, a value of 3 or 4 moist and a chroma of 1 or 2 dry. Textures are ashy loam or ashy silt loam.\nThe 2Bk horizon has a value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist. Textures are loam or silt loam.  It has 1 to 5 percent calcium carbonate.\nThe 2Bkqm horizon has a hue of 2.5Y or 10YR and a value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 0 to 1 moist. Cementing agents are silica and calcium carbonate. Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has a hue of 5Y through 10YR and a value of 3 or 4 moist. Redox features have a hue of 5Y through 7.5YR and a value of 3 to 5 moist and a chroma of 3 to 6 moist. SAR is 1 to 8."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Simsfield soils are in bottoms and on side slopes in small depressions. Slopes are from 0 to 30 percent. These soils formed in loess, volcanic ash and pumice and loess over glaciolacustrine sediments. Elevation ranges from 1,600 to 2,600 feet. Average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. Average January temperature is 27 degrees F and average July temperature is 71 degrees F. Average annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days."

The DelRio soils are in depressions, swales, outwash channels, and on side slopes of kames and terraces. Ellisforde soils are on side slopes of terraces. DelRio and Ellisforde soils do not have a cemented duripan within the soil profile. St.Andrews soils are on glaciolacustrine-influenced till plains and have an argillic horizon."
