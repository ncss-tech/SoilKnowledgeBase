  "OVERVIEW": "The Simsfield series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils.  They formed in volcanic ash and loess over glaciolacustrine sediments.  They are on terraces and in depressions on terraces on glaciated plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and average annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
