Rock fragments of metasediments, primarily phyllite and slate, range from 15 to 75 percent in the A horizon, from 25 to 80 percent in the Bw horizon, and from 45 to 90 percent in the C horizon.  Rock fragments average more than 35 percent in the textural control section.  Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 8.  It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Nassau is presently the only other series in this family.   Additionally, series that were formerly in the same family, but have not been updated to the latest editions of Keys to Soil Taxonomy include Arnot, Bugley, Klinesville, Weikert and Zango.  Arnot and Nassau soils are developed in a mantle of glacial till; and in addition Arnot soils have dominantly sandstone rock fragments in the Bw horizon, and Nassau soils have dominantly slate rock fragments in the Bw horizon.  Bugley soils formed in residuum from sericite schist or graphitic schist.  Klinesville soils have 5YR through 10R hue.  Weikert soils have rock fragments of dominantly shale in the Bw horizon.  Zango soils formed in colluvium and have rock fragments from tuffs, breccias, and andesite rocks.\nSeries that were formerly in the same family but have been placed in a semiactive family include Rohan and Unicoi.  Rohan soils are underlain by carbonaceous fissle shale and have rock fragments of fissle shale.  Unicoi soils are underlain by arkose and arkosic sandstone bedrock and include rock fragments of arkose and arkosic sandstone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sylvatus soils formed in materials weathered from metasediments of phyllite and slate.  They are on gently sloping ridgetops and very steep convex side slopes in the Blue Ridge province.  Slopes range from 2 to 80 percent.  The climate is temperate and humid.  The mean air temperature ranges from 53 to 56 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 45 inches."

Cataska, Dekalb, Lily, and Sylco soils are deeper to bedrock and occur on similar landscape positions.  Jefferson, Matneflat, and Tumbling soils are deeper to bedrock and occur on colluvial fans and footslopes."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Soils now within the range of the Sylvatus series were correlated as Berks, Cataska, Ramsey, and Weikert in several published soil surveys.\nThe 3/99 revision places Sylvatus soils in an active family based on eight pedons (see below) in Virginia.  The average CEC/clay ratio for these pedons is .53, about mid-range for the active class.  Competing series and other minor items were also revised.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1)  ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 4 inches (Oi and A horizons).\n2)  cambic horizon - the zone from 4 to 16 inches (Bw horizon).\n3)  lithic contact - phyllite bedrock at 19 inches (R horizon).\nSIR = VA0273, VA0337 (VERY CHANNERY), VA0345 (VERY STONY)\nMLRA = 130\nREVISED: 1/3/90-DDR,DAG,WJE; 3/99-DHK\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Ranges for morphology, chemistry, particle-size distribution, and sand and silt minerals are based on 8 pedons. Dominant minerals in the sand fraction are quartz, 76 to 98 percent, and feldspar, 1 to 12 percent.  Dominant minerals in the silt fraction are quartz, 52 to 83 percent, and feldspar, 1 to 21 percent.  These data are contained in: 1.  Edmonds, W. J., D. D. Rector, N. O. Wilson, and T. L.
