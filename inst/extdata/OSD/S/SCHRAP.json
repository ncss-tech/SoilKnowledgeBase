  "OVERVIEW": "The Schrap series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils formed in alluvium from shale, schist and sandstone.  Schrap soils are on hills, mountains and pediments and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 62 degrees F.",
