They formed in alluvium from shale, schist and sandstone.  Elevations range from 3,200 to 5,720 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and winter rain.  Mean annual air temperature is 58 to 68 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 170 to 240 days."
