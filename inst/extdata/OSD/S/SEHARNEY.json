  "OVERVIEW": "The Seharney series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from basalt or andesite with a mixture of loess. Seharney soils are on plateaus and hills. Slopes are 3 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
