    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Seharney soils are on plateaus and hills. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt or andesite with a mixture of loess. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. Elevations range from 1280 to 1,610 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
