These soils are usually moist in the moisture control section but are dry 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The upper 10 to 28 inches of the profile has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.35 g/cc, 5 to 25 percent sand sized ash, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter, glass content of 30 to 50 percent and acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent.  It has 0 to 5 percent rock fragments, and an apparent field estimated clay content of 5 to 15 percent.\nThe particle-size control section 2Btkn has 18 to 30 percent clay and less than 15 percent by weight of fine sand or coarser.  Depth to calcium carbonate accumulation is 17 to 28 inches.  Depth to indurated lime-silica duripan is 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to basalt bedrock is 50 to 60 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist. Chroma is 2 or 3 dry.\nThe AB horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Texture is ashy fine sandy loam or ashy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist. Chroma is 3 or 4 dry. Texture is ashy fine sandy loam or ashy loam.\nThe 2Btkn horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist. Chroma of 3 to 6 dry. Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam.
