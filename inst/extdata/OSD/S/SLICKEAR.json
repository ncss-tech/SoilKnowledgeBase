  "OVERVIEW": "The Slickear series consists of deep to a duripan well drained soils formed in mixed loess, mixed with volcanic ash over older loess over a duripan over basalt on nonglaciated plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
