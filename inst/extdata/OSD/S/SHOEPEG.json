Birdow soils are well drained and are effervescent to the surface.  Blackrock soils are well drained and have 20 to 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Catherine soils are in a fine silty family.  Coit and Eastcan soils are calcareous throughout.  Dagor soils are well drained.  Dithod, Drax, and Eastfork soils are not in a cumulic family.  Draper soils have an Ustic moisture regime.  Eld soils are medium or slightly acid.  Goosenawt soils lack mottles, are well drained and have buried A horizons.  Gosinta, Monroe, and Goose Creek soils have an aridic moisture regime.  Lakeview soils have B horizons, lack mottles, and have a 50 to 110 day growing season, and a 46 to 48 degree F average annual air temperature.  Soquel soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 58 degrees F, lack a water table above 60 inches, and have a frost-free season of about 220 to 275 days.  Average annual precipitation is 25 to 50 inches.   Vina soils are well drained and lack a water table above 60 inches.  Willowdale soils are well drained, have a 60 to 120 day frost-free season, and have 10 to 20 percent pumice in the control section."
