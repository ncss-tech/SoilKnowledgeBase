  "OVERVIEW": "The Shenon series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in alluvium dominantly from extrusive igneous rock.  Shenon soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 20 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
