  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 70 inches. The depth to bedrock is 6 to 15 feet. Coarse fragments range from 35 to 75 percent by weighted volume in the profile, and range 25 to 80 percent by volume in individual horizons. In areas that have been cropped the surface stones can range less than 35 percent. The soil reaction ranges from extremely acid to very strongly acid in the upper part and from strongly acid to very strongly acid in the fragipan. In areas that are limed, soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe A horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 4, and chroma of 0 to 3. The texture is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam. A horizons have weak fine and medium granular structure.\nThe B horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. The texture of the B is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam. Structure is weak to moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky.\nThe Bx horizons have hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. Structure is weak to moderate very coarse prismatic, parting to moderate to strong medium, coarse or very coarse platy or subangular blocky, or it is massive within the prisms.\nSome pedons have Cd horizons with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Textures are loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam."

Shohola soils formed in loamy till, mainly from areas of sandstone, and shale. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 50 inches and is evenly distributed throughout the year. Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 52 degrees F., and the growing season ranges from 110 to 200 days."

The Mardin, Wellsboro, and Wurtsboro soils are very deep, moderately well drained soils with fragipans on nearby convex toeslopes. The Edgemere soils are very deep, poorly drained on depressional areas and along streams and drainageways. Morris and Volusia soils are very deep, somewhat poorly drained, fragipan soils on directly adjacent footslopes. The Chippewa and Norwich soils are very deep, very poorly drained fine-loamy soils with less than 35 percent stones on similar landscapes."
