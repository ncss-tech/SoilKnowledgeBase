  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Total thickness of the organic layers ranges from 10 to 16 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is about 47 degrees F.  The soil is not frozen below a depth of 2 inches in most years due to maritime influence.  Reaction is extremely or very strongly acid (0.01M CaCl2) throughout the profile.\nThe moist chroma of the organic layers ranges from 1 to 3.  When present, the C horizon has texture of silt loam, loam or sandy loam with 20 to 90 percent gravel, cobbles, and stones.  The hue ranges from 5YR through 10YR, the value is 2 or 3, and the chroma ranges from 1 through 4."

The mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F and the mean annual summer air temperature is about 50 degrees F.  Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this profile include: a histic epipedon 11 inches thick; a lithic contact at 14 inches; pH of 4.5 (0.01M CaCl2) or greater in the organic layer from 4 to 11 inches; sapric material from 0.5 to 11 inches.  It is assumed that these soils never freeze below 2 inches.\nSunnyhay soils were formerly classified as dysic.  However, the pH is 4.5 (0.01M CaCl2) or greater in one or more layers within the control section is all profiles.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
