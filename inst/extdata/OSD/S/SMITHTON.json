Rounded or subrounded quartz gravel range from 0 to 5 percent by volume throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, or is neutral, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or less.  It is loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5, 6, or 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Mottles are in shades of brown.\nThe BE horizon, if present, has colors and textures similar to the E horizon.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or is neutral, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 2 or less, with mottles in shades of brown or yellow, or is a mottled horizon in shades of gray, brown, or yellow. It is loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or rarely silt loam, also includes sandy clay loam, clay loam, and silty clay loam at depths below 40 inches.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes are dominantly less than 1 percent, but range to 3 percent.  These soils formed in loamy alluvial sediments.  The climate is warm and humid near the type location.  The average annual temperature ranges from about 62 to 68 degrees F and the average annual precipitation ranges from about 48 to 54 inches."

Gurdon soils occur on similar landscapes; are in a coarse-loamy particle size class and are somewhat poorly drained.  Guyton soils are on flood plains;  are in a fine-silty particle size class and have more than 35 percent base saturation.  Harleston soils are on slightly higher landscapes are moderately well drained and moderately permeable.  Pheba soils are on similar landscapes, are in a coarse-silty particle size class and contain a fragipan.  Sardis soils are on flood plains and low terraces, are somewhat poorly drained, are in a fine-silty particle size class and do not have an argillic horizon.  Savannah soils are on higher landscapes, are in a fine-loamy particle size class, are moderately well drained and contain a fragipan. Stough soils are on similar landscapes are somewhat poorly drained and have fragic properties."
