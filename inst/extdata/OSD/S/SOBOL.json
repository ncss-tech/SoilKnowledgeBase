  "STATES": "OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sobol series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from shale of Pennsylvanian age.  These very gently sloping to strongly sloping upland soils are on side slopes and ridge crests in the valleys of the Ouachita Mountains (MLRA 119).  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 1220 mm (48 inches), and mean annual temperature is 17 degrees C. (63 degrees F.).",
