  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  In some pedons, there are lenses of cemented tuffaceous sediments below the B2t horizon.  Solum thickness and depth to the very gravelly substratum are 22 to 36 inches.  Soil temperature is 53 to 56 degrees F., and mineralogy is mixed.  The soils become dry in the moisture control section about June 5 and remain dry until about October 1.  At other times the soils are moist.\nThe A horizons have colors with 10YR hues, values of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chromas of 1 through 4.  Texture is sandy loam or clay loam.  Structure is moderate granular, moderate subangular blocky or the soils are massive.  Consistence is slightly hard or hard, friable, nonplastic, slightly plastic or plastic, nonsticky, slightly sticky or sticky.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe B2t horizon colors have 10YR hues, values of 5 or 6 dry and 4 moist, and chromas of 2, 3, or 4.  Textures are clay or heavy clay loam and reaction is strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe C horizons have colors with hues of 10YR, values of 5 through 7 and chromas of 2 and 3 dry, and 2 moist.  Textures are very gravelly clay loam or heavy loam.  Reaction is moderately acid."

Clough soils have very gravelly clay B2t horizons and a duripan at 29 inches.  Fiddyment soils have a gradual AB boundary and a slightly acid B2t horizon.  Haire soils have a very gravelly clay IIC horizon at 36 inches, and Hillgate soils have neutral B2t horizons.  Huichica soils have a moderately acid B2t horizon and a duripan at 30 inches.  Milpitas soils have slightly acid and neutral B2t horizons and Millsap soils have slightly acid B2t horizons and an R layer at 39 inches.  Pinnacles soils have a sandy clay B2t horizon and a paralithic layer at 25 inches.  San Ysidro soils have slightly acid and neutral B2t horizons, and Santa Ynez soils have A2 horizons and gravelly and very gravelly B2t horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Spreckels soils occur on sloping to hilly uplands of tuffaceous sediments.  They occur at elevations of 100 to 800 feet, in a subhumid mesothermal climate with mean annual rainfall of 25 to 30 inches, with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F., average January temperature about 46 degrees F., and average July temperature about 64 degrees F.  Frost free season averages about 210 days."
