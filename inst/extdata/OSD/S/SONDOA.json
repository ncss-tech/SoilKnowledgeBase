These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,158 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."

This soil was previously correlated in the Lovelock Area, Nevada as Sonoma silt loam, drained, strongly saline-alkali.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  A pedon of Sondoa sampled within 2,000 feet of the series type location has full characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as pedon ID S08NV027001 (pedon # 08N0492).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
