  "OVERVIEW": "The Sondoa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Sondoa soils are on stream terraces and basin-floor remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
