  "OVERVIEW": "The Serpentano series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from serpentinite and peridotite.  Serpentano soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 3 to 70 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches.",

The soil has a udic moisture regime but has a short dry period of less than 45 consecutive days during the summer.  The depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  Gravel and cobbles of serpentinite or peridotite range from 25 to 75 percent throughout the soil and averages more then 35 percent in the particle-size control section.  Rock fragments are dominantly hard and unweathered, but range from slightly hard to extremely hard.  The soil is slightly acid or neutral.  Hue is 10YR through 5YR in the solum.\nAn 0i horizon up to 3 inches thick is on most locations, with up to 55 percent of stones, cobbles, and gravel of peridotite forming a pavement on the surface.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It has 22 to 27 percent clay with 15 to 30 percent gravel, 5 to 10 percent cobbles, and 10 to 15 percent stones.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It is loam or clay loam, with 22 to 32 percent clay and is gravelly, very gravelly, or very cobbly.  It has 20 to 40 percent gravel, 10 to 15 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 6 moist and dry.  It is loam or clay loam with 22 to 32 percent clay and is very gravelly, extremely gravelly, very cobbly, or extremely cobbly.

The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 130 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 40 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 61 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 210 days."
