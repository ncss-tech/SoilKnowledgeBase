    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 100 inches.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout, except where the surface has been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 6. Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.\nSome pedons have a BA or BE horizon with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The range in texture is the same as the E horizon.\nThe upper part of Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Some pedons have a thin upper Bt horizon with a hue of 7.5YR and the same range of value and chroma. This horizon is typically 10 inches thick, or less. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon has the same range in color as the upper part. Some pedons have few to many mottles in shades of red and brown. Pockets of sand in shades of brown and yellow range from none to many.  Some pedons have chert, quartz or ironstone pebbles that constitute as much as 10 percent of the volume.  Texture is sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe BC or CB horizon, where present, has the same range in color as the upper part of the Bt horizon. Mottles in shades of red, yellow and brown range from none to common. Pockets of sand grains range from none to common. Presence of mica flakes range from none to common. Some pedons have chert, quartz or ironstone pebbles that constitute as much as 10 percent of the volume. Texture is loamy sand or sandy loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, ranges from 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles in shades of red, yellow and brown range from none to many.  In some pedons there is no dominant color and it is mottled in shades of red, brown or yellow. Pockets of sand grains range from none to common. Presence of mica flakes range from none to common. Some pedons have chert, quartz or ironstone pebbles that constitute as much as 10 percent of the volume.  Texture is sand or loamy sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Cahaba, Emporia, Fruitdale, Hartsells and Kempsville in the same family and the Cowarts, Olla, Stringtown and Suffolk soils in closely related families.  Cahaba soils are on terrace positions that are subject to rare flooding and have a solum thickness of less than 60 inches.  Emporia soils have a seasonal high water table at a 36 to 54-inch depth.  Fruitdale soils have yellower subsoils and have a seasonal high water table less than 72 inches from the surface. Hartsells soils are in the Southern Appalachians Ridges and Valleys MLRA (128) and Sand Mountain MLRA (129) and are moderately deep to sandstone bedrock. Kempsville soils have yellower subsoils. Cowarts soils have a kandic horizon.  Olla, Stringtown, and Suffolk soils have yellower subsoils."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Smithdale soils are on hill slopes and ridge tops in dissected uplands of the Southern and Western Coastal Plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent, but are dominantly from 2 to 40 percent.  They formed in thick beds of loamy marine or fluvial deposits of upper Cretaceous to early Quaternary periods.  The climate is humid subtropical. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 52 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bama, Boykin, Lucy, Luverne, McLaurin, Ora, Providence, Ruston, Saffell, Sweatman, Troup and Wadley series.  Bama and Ruston soils are on higher and broader positions. In addition, Bama soils do not have a significant decrease in clay within 60 inches and Ruston soils have a bisequum. Boykin, Lucy and Troup and Wadley soils are on lower hill slope positions. In addition, Boykin and Lucy soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick while Troup and Wadley Soils sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches thick.  Luverne and Sweatman soils are on lower foot slope positions and have clayey control sections.  McLaurin soils are on slightly higher broad positions and have coarse-loamy control sections.  The moderately well drained Ora and Providence soils are on higher positions and have fragipans.  Saffell soils are on similar positions but are gravelly throughout the profile."
