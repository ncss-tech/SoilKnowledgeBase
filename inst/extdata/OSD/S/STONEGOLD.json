    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aftaden (NM), Sparkhule (CA), and Zyplar T (NV) series. Aftaden and Zyplar soils receive more rainfall and are moist for more than 20 days cumulative in some part of the soil moisture control section during July and October. In addition, Zyplar soils have characteristically lower soil temperatures, and have 20 to 30 percent clay in the control section. Sparkhule soils have finer textures and redder hues in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stonegold soils are on summits of basalt hills and mountains. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. The soils formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt and other volcanic sources. Elevations are from 3,200 to 4,500 feet. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. Most precipitation occurs in winter but a significant portion is received between July and September following convection storms. The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 7 inches; mean annual air temperature is 61 to 66 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 240 to 300 days."
