  "OVERVIEW": "The Sonnier series consist of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in recent clayey sediments overlying late Pliestocene age loamy terrace deposits. These soils are at the same level as the Red River flood plains. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent; but dominantly are less than 2 percent.",
