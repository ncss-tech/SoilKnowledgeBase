    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is more than 80 inches. Cracks 1/2 inch to 1 inch wide extend from the surface to a depth of about 10 inches when the soil is dry. Depth to the 2A horizon ranges from 10 to 24 inches. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline in the Ap and Bw horizons, and from moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline in the 2A, 2E, 2Bt and 2Bt/E horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3. Redox concentrations in shades of yellow or red range from none to few. Texture is clay or silty clay.\nThe Bw horizon has the same color and texture as the A horizon. Redox concentrations and depletions in shades of yellow, red and gray range from few to common.\nThe 2A horizon has hue to 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 or 2. Redox concentrations are in shades of yellow and brown. Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam or silty clay.\nThe 2E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Redox concentrations are in shades of yellow and brown. Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe 2Bt and 2Bt/E horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8. Redox concentrations and depletions are in shades of red, brown, yellow or gray. The E parts of the 2Bt/E horizon are vertical strippings in the lower part of the solum. They have hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Similar soils are the Bowdre, Earle, Latanier, Newellton, Solier and Tunica series. Bowdre, Earle, Newellton and Tunica have a grayer surface layer and do not have a buried argillic horizon. Latanier soils have a reddish clayey mantle 20 to 40 inches thick, and do not have a burried argillic horizon. Solier soils have buried loess below the mantle of clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sonnier soils are on nearly level, low terraces of late Pleistocene age that are at present flood plain elevations. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. These soils are formed in late-Pleistocene age loamy alluvium the is overlain by more recent clayey Red River alluvial sediments. The mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 70 degrees F. Elevation ranges from 160 to 170 feet above sea level. Frost free days range from 250 to 275."

The McKamie soils are on sideslopes of the Red River Valley escarpment, do not have a clayey overwash layer, and have a redder argillic horizon."

Complete characterization data were run by NSSL on another pedon near the type location (S96-LA015-29).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
