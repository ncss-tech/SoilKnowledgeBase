  "OVERVIEW": "The Summerford series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium derived dominantly from igneous rocks.  Summerford soils are on alluvial fans and fan piedmonts with slopes of 5 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 2 to 28 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, BCt horizons)\nThis series represents an identified soil within the Desert Soil-Geomorphology Project, Las Cruces, New Mexico.  The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The classification is supported by analyses of four pedons in the vicinity of the type location.  The analyses are in \"The biochemistry of phosphorus cycling and phosphorus availability in a desert ecosystem\", a Ph. D. thesis by Kate Lajtha for the Department of Botany, Duke University.  These pedons were sampled arbitrary depths instead of by horizons and for this reason part of the Bt horizon was included in sampling the upper layer.  When allowance is made for this, the analyses support an argillic horizon, and also show that these soils have too little organic carbon for a mollic epipedon.  Thin section studies (L.H. Gile, unpublished information) show the coatings of oriented clay on sand grains that are typical of the argillic horizon in this area.\nUpdated competing series section 3/17/08, CEM.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
