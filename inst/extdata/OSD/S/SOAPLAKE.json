These soils are usually dry in all parts between a depth of 8 inches and the lithic contact for more than half the time the soil temperature at the lithic contact is greater than 41 degrees F. (about 105 to 120 days).  Depth to a lithic contact is 10 to 20 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from neutral to slightly alkaline.  The particle-size control section is 8 to 15 percent clay and 5 to 20 percent rock fragments.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.   It is 0 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, and has weak fine subangular blocky or granular structure.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam and has 5 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Organic matter is less than one percent."
