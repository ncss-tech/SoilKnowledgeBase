  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Bedded shale typically is between a depth of 40 and 60 inches but is below 60 inches in some pedons.  Colors throughout the soil are inherent to the shale.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay or clay and contains 0 to 15 percent by volume of fine fragments of shale less than 3 mm in size. It is extremely acid to slightly acid.  Some pedons have a thin distinct E horizon as evidenced by prominent clean silt and sand grains.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, and 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Moist value typically is one unit higher when rubbed.  It has 0 to 20 percent by volume of fine fragments of shale less than 3 mm in size.  It is strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe BC and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Moist value typically is one unit higher when rubbed.  They have 15 to 50 percent by volume of fine to coarse fragments of shale ranging from 1 to 25 mm in size.  They are very strongly acid or extremely acid.\nThe Cr horizon is multicolored in hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; and is very hard and brittle but has a hardness of less than 3 on the Moh's scale of hardness.  It is very strongly acid or extremely acid."
