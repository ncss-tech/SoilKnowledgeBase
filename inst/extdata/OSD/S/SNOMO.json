  "OVERVIEW": "The Snomo series consists of deep or very deep, well drained soils formed in clayey materials weathered from acid shale on the uplands.  These soils have moderate permeability.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Bedded shale typically is between a depth of 40 and 60 inches but is below 60 inches in some pedons.  Colors throughout the soil are inherent to the shale.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay or clay and contains 0 to 15 percent by volume of fine fragments of shale less than 3 mm in size. It is extremely acid to slightly acid.  Some pedons have a thin distinct E horizon as evidenced by prominent clean silt and sand grains.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, and 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Moist value typically is one unit higher when rubbed.  It has 0 to 20 percent by volume of fine fragments of shale less than 3 mm in size.  It is strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe BC and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Moist value typically is one unit higher when rubbed.  They have 15 to 50 percent by volume of fine to coarse fragments of shale ranging from 1 to 25 mm in size.  They are very strongly acid or extremely acid.\nThe Cr horizon is multicolored in hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; and is very hard and brittle but has a hardness of less than 3 on the Moh's scale of hardness.  It is very strongly acid or extremely acid."
