    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock (lithic contact) ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 70 percent in individual horizons and average 35 to 60 percent in the control section.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 41 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is about 59 to 64 degrees F.  The A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  It is slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 8 dry, 3 to 6 moist and chroma 2 to 8.  It ranges from very gravelly or gravelly and very cobbly sandy loam to clay loam."

Elevations range from 6,700 to 8,800 feet.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from limestone, calcareous sandstone, and shale.  Slope gradients are 2 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches and the freeze-free period ranges from 70 to 100 days.  The mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F."

Osote soils have an ochric epipedon and cambic horizon with less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Podo and Rachert soils have ochric epipedons and are 20 inches or less deep to bedrock.  Vanet soils have an ochric epipedon, and a cambic horizon.  Winet soils have an ochric epipedon and are over 40 inches in depth to bedrock."
