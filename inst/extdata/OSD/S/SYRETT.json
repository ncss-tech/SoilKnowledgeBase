  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Syrett series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on benches and sideslopes of mesas.  They formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from sedimentary rocks.  Slope ranges from 2 to 40 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 19 inches.",

Rock fragments range from 0 to 70 percent in individual horizons and average 35 to 60 percent in the control section.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 41 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is about 59 to 64 degrees F.  The A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  It is slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 8 dry, 3 to 6 moist and chroma 2 to 8.  It ranges from very gravelly or gravelly and very cobbly sandy loam to clay loam."

The average annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches and the freeze-free period ranges from 70 to 100 days.
