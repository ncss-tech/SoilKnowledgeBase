  "OVERVIEW": "The Stady series consists of very deep, well drained soils moderately deep to sand and gravel.  Permeability is moderate in the upper horizons and very rapid in the 2Bk and 2C horizons.  These soils formed in loamy alluvium over sand and gravel and are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 15 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  A few pebbles and an occasional stone are in the A and Bw horizons.  The depth to sand and gravel ranges from 20 to 40 inches and depth to carbonates ranges from 15 to 25 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2.  It is loam or silt loam.  It is neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam and neutral or slightly alkaline.  There are faint clay films on faces of peds and a slight clay increase in the Bw horizon in some pedons.  It has strong or moderate coarse or medium prismatic structure parting to strong or moderate angular and subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or gravelly loam and has weak or moderate structure.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bk and 2C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  They have a wide range in size and amount of gravel and sand.  Much of the sand and gravel is from sedimentary rocks."

Lehr and Shambo soils are on similar landscapes.  Shambo soils do not have gravelly 2C horizons within depths of 40 inches.  Farland, Manning, Parshall, Tally and Wabek soils are on nearby terraces but commonly at a different level.  Farland soils are fine-silty and have an argillic horizon.  Manning soils are coarse-loamy above the 2C material.  Parshall soils have mollic epipedons thicker than 16 inches and are coarse-loamy.  Tally soils have sandy loam textures and do not have 2C horizons.  Wabek soils do not have Bw horizons, typically are less than 10 inches thick over 2C horizons, and are sandy-skeletal."

    "section": "REMARKS",

Where it has been previously correlated in association with glacial landforms it will be recorrelated to Bowdle in the future."
