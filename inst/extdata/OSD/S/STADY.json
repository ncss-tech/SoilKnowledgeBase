  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  A few pebbles and an occasional stone are in the A and Bw horizons.  The depth to sand and gravel ranges from 20 to 40 inches and depth to carbonates ranges from 15 to 25 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2.  It is loam or silt loam.  It is neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam and neutral or slightly alkaline.  There are faint clay films on faces of peds and a slight clay increase in the Bw horizon in some pedons.  It has strong or moderate coarse or medium prismatic structure parting to strong or moderate angular and subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or gravelly loam and has weak or moderate structure.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bk and 2C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  They have a wide range in size and amount of gravel and sand.  Much of the sand and gravel is from sedimentary rocks."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stady soils are on level to moderately sloping stream terraces.  Slopes are mainly l to 4 percent but range from 0 to 9 percent.  Stady soils formed in loamy alluvium over sand and gravel.  The climate is semiarid with a mean annual air temperature of 34 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation of 12 to 18 inches.  Three-fourths of the precipitation falls in the spring and summer."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Lehr soils and the Farland, Manning, Parshall, Shambo, Tally and Wabek soils.  Lehr and Shambo soils are on similar landscapes.  Shambo soils do not have gravelly 2C horizons within depths of 40 inches.  Farland, Manning, Parshall, Tally and Wabek soils are on nearby terraces but commonly at a different level.  Farland soils are fine-silty and have an argillic horizon.  Manning soils are coarse-loamy above the 2C material.  Parshall soils have mollic epipedons thicker than 16 inches and are coarse-loamy.  Tally soils have sandy loam textures and do not have 2C horizons.  Wabek soils do not have Bw horizons, typically are less than 10 inches thick over 2C horizons, and are sandy-skeletal."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon -  the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 12 inches (Ap and Bw1 horizons); The zone from 12 to 15 inches (Bw2 horizon) meets the requirements for a cambic horizon except for thickness.\nThe intent is for the series to be used in association with residual landforms.  Where it has been previously correlated in association with glacial landforms it will be recorrelated to Bowdle in the future.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
