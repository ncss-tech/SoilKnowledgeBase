  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches in thickness.  Depth to sand and gravel ranges between 20 and 36 inches and has 20 to 40 percent by volume of gravel.  That part of the control section above the sand and gravel is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam averaging between 18 and 27 percent clay.  Most pedons have carbonate at the surface but some pedons are leached to depths of 6 inches in native grass.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges between 20 and 40 percent in the calcic horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk and Bkz horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5 and 3 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam; and slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  They have few or common, faint or distinct redox features.  Accumulations of carbonate range from few to many.  Nests of gypsum and other salts commonly are in the lower Bk horizon of most pedons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is loamy sand, gravelly loamy sand, or gravelly sand and slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

These soils formed in loamy alluvium overlying glaciofluvial sand and gravel.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 26 inches."

Delmont, Dempster, and Enet soils do not have a calcic horizon and are drier and are on higher parts of the landscape.  In addition, Delmont soils have sand and gravel above a depth of 20 inches.  Dimo and Fedora soils are on landscapes similar to the Storla soils.  Dimo soils do not have a calcic horizon and Fedora soils are coarse-loamy."
