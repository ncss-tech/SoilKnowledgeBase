  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to horizons having less than 35 percent clay ranges from 25 to 39 inches.  The upper clayey solum has a weighted average clay content of 40 to 60 percent.  The loamy lower part has clay content of 15 to 35 percent.  When dry, cracks 1/2 to more than 3 inches wide extend from the surface to a depth of more than 12 inches.  Cracks remain open 90 to 150 cumulative days in most years.\nThe horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value 4 or 5 and chroma 2.  These horizons are clay or silty clay.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline and they are calcareous.\nThe 2Ab horizon is dark brown (10YR 3/3, 4/3), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2; 2.5Y 4/2), or grayish brown (10YR 5/2, 4/2).  Mottles of yellowish brown, brown, strong brown, or reddish brown range from none to common.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline and they are calcareous.  A yellowish brown, brown, or strong brown B2 horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe 2Btb horizon is brownish yellow, yellowish brown, brown, pale brown, light yellowish brown, or strong brown.  Texture is extremely variable and ranges from sandy clay loam to sandy loam. Some pedons have 2C horizons within 40 inches of the surface that are loamy fine sand or fine sand.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Navaca in the same family and the similar Belk, Frio, Kufman, Ovan, Tinn and Trinity seies.  Belk soils have colors in hue of 7.5YR and redder.  Navaca, Kaufman, Tinn and Trinity soils have chroma of 1 in the upper 24 inches of the soil and Frio, Kaufman, Ovan, Tinn and Trinity soils do not have contrasting textures within 40 inches of the soil surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Seagoville soils are on nearly level to gently sloping flood plains.  Slopes are dominantly less than 1 percent but range from 0 to 2 percent.  The soil formed in clayey alluvium deposited over low lying loamy terrace sediments.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 40 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 65 degrees F.  The Thornthwaite P-E index is 44 to 64. Frost free days range from 200 to 240.  The elevation ranges from 450 to 650.\nGeographically Associated Soils;  These are the competing Kaufman, Ovan, and Trinity series as well as the Aquilla, Bastrop, and Silstid series.  Aquilla, Bastrop, and Silstid soils lack intersecting slickensides and have less than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Kaufman, Ovan, Tinn and Trinity are in similar positions to Seagoville.  Aquilla, Bastrop and Silstid are on slightly higher positions."
