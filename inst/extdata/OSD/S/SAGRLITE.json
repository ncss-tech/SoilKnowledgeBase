The soil is calcareous throughout.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, with chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam, and sandy clay loam.  Clay ranges from 18 to 34 percent.  Reaction is slightly to moderately alkaline, and effervescence ranges from strong to violent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 20 percent.  Electrical conductivity ranges from 0 to 4 mmhos/cm.\nThe C horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, with a chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam, and less commonly very fine sandy loam, and sandy clay loam with some pedons having layers of silty clay loam.  Clay ranges 18 to 34 percent in thin horizons, but the weighted average clay percent in the particle size control section is less than 27 percent.  Reaction is slightly to moderately alkaline and effervescence ranges from strong to violent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 10 to 20 percent.  Electrical conductivity ranges from 2 to 8 mmhos/cm.  Some pedons contain accumulations of gypsum.  Gypsum content is less than 1 percent."

Blueagle soils average more than 27 percent clay in the particle size control section and are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative following summer convection storms.  Chumall soils contain more than 50 percent exchangeable sodium in the B and C horizons and have relict mottles in the 2C horizon.  Easychair soils have durinodes in the C horizon.  Rosney soils have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 52 degrees F., and contain volcanic ash in some parts.  Sagers, Sain, Sondoa, and Tocito soils average 27 to 34 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Swingler soils are moderately well drained and contain relict mottles at a depth ranging from 19 to 40 inches.  Timpie soils have a mean annual soil temperature ranging down to 49 degrees F., and electrical conductivity values exceeding 16 mmhos/cm are in the B and C horizons.  Killpack and Littlehat soils have a paralithic contact above 40 inches."
