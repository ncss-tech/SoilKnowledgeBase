  "OVERVIEW": "The Sanclemente series consists of moderately deep well drained soils that formed in fine alluvium derived from mixed rock sources resting over volcanic rock.  Sanclemente soils are on hills and terraces and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 245 millimeters (9.5 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C. (62.5 degrees F.).",
