The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 degrees to 49 degrees F. The mean annual temperature temperature ranges from 65 to 70 degrees F. The soils are usually moist when the soil temperature is more than 41 degrees F., but are dry for 65 to 85 consecutive days during the summer. The 10 to 40 inch control section is loam or silt loam and has 18 to 26 percent clay.\nThe Al horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist. It is loam or silt loam. This horizon is slightly or moderately calcareous and mildly or moderately alkaline. It ranges from 11 to 18 inches thick .\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist. It ranges from heavy loam to silt loam, or heavy silt loam.  This horizon is strongly calcare-ous, moderately and strongly alkaline, and ranges from 5 to 8 inches thick.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist. It is loam or silt loam. This horizon is strongly calcareous, and the lime is veined, blocky or bedded . It is moderately or strongly alkaline and ranges from 26 to more than 41 inched thick. The material below the Cca horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and value of 6 or 7 dry. It ranges from very fine sandy loam to silty loam or silty clay loam."

Slope gradients are 10 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in mixed lake sediments.  The climate is moist subhumid and the average annual precipita-tion ranges from 18 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 63 to 70 degrees F., and the frost-free period ranges from 100 to 105 days."
