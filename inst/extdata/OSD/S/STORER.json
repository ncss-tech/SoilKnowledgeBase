These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick and has a base saturation greater than 75 percent.  These soils have some volcanic ash influence in the upper part, but do not meet requirements for vitrandic subgroup.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 70 percent coarse fragments, and 8 to 15 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral throughout.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A1 horizon has values of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe A2 horizon has values of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam.  It has 15 to 40 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has values of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It has 30 to 45 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe C horizon has values of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chromas of 2 to 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, or extremely channery sandy loam. It has 25 to 55 percent angular gravel and 10 to 40 percent channers."

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from metavolcanic and metamorphic  rock.  Elevations range from 2,600 to 4,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 18 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 25 to 30 degrees F, the average July temperature ranges from 65 to 70 degrees F, and the average annual temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 110 to 130 days."
