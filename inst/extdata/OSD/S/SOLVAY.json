The poorly drained Carway soils have fine textured buried soil material between 20 and 40 inches (50 to 102 centimeters). They are in depressions. The moderately well drained, sandy Dillhut soils do not have an argillic horizon and are on low dunes. The well drained, coarse-loamy Hayes soils are on dunes. The well drained, sandy Pratt and Turon soils are on dunes. Langdon and Tivin soils are excessively drained and on high dunes. The poorly drained, sandy Plev soils are in depressions. The poorly drained, fine-loamy Warnut soils are in depressions."
