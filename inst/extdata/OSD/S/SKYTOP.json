  "OVERVIEW": "The Skytop series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in till derived primarily from gray and brown quartzite, conglomerate, and sandstone. Slope ranges from 3 to 70 percent. Permeability is moderately rapid to rapid. Mean annual precipitation is 40 inches. Mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F.",

Rock fragments of glacially subrounded and triangulated sandstone and siltstone range from 20 to 40 percent in the surface horizon and 35 to 60 percent in the solum. Reaction is very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is very channery, flaggy, or stony loam, sandy loam or loamy sand. It has weak fine granular structure. Some pedons may have an E horizon with hues and chroma similar to the A horizon, but with values of 4 or 5.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6. It is very channery, flaggy, or stony sandy loam or loamy sand. It has weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure.\nSome pedons have C horizons with hues of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, values of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 or 6. There can be some uncoated sand grains with lower chroma. It is very channery, flaggy, or stony sandy loam or loamy sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Madsheep series is in the same family. The Madsheep soils are formed in red noncalcareous shale, siltstone, and sandstone. The hues in the Bw are 5YR or redder.\nClosely related soils are Lordstown, Lagross, Macomber, Mandy, Mosine, Mongaup, Oquaga, Paddyknob, Wasnot, and Vly soils. The Lordstown and Oquaga soils are in a mesic temperature regime. Lagross, Macomber, Mandy, Mosine, and Vly soils have less than 90 percent by weight silica minerals within the mineralogy control section. Paddyknob soils are formed in residuum and are superactive. Vly soils have redder hues. The Wasnot soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock. Mongaup soils have more silt and are not skeletal."

Siliceous mineralogy is assumed from samples of other soils nearby on similar geologic formations.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 4 inches (A horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 4 inches to a depth of about 30 inches (Bw horizons).\n3. CEC activity class is estimated from data on similar parent materials.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
