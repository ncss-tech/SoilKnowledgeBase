  "OVERVIEW": "The Skiyou series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in loess and volcanic ash, overlying mixed  glacial till.  Skiyou soils are on glacially modified uplands and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 65 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
