  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Schrader soils are on floodplains and low terraces.   Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  These soils formed in highly stratified alluvium and outwash derived from mixed sources.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 8 inches, but is up to 20 inches in other areas of the state.  The soil moisture is controlled by a high water table that is within a few inches of the surface during much of the growing season.  Mean annual temperature is 41 to 44 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 58 to 62 degrees F."

Vastine soils have a mollic epipedon less than 24 inches thick and are underlain by sand and gravel at depths of 20 to 40 inches."
