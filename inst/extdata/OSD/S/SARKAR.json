  "REVDATE": "11/2002",
  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sarkar series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from weathered calcareous bedrock.  Sarkar soils occur on dissected ridges, knobs, and sideslopes having karst topography.  Slopes range from 10 to 120 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 130 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum typically is 13 inches thick but ranges from 8 to 17 inches.  Depth to bedrock is from 8 to 20 inches.  Coarse fragments in the upper part of the solum range from 5 to 15 percent and are dominantly gravel. Coarse fragments range up to 30 percent in the lower B horizons of some pedons.  Some pedons have a buried sequum.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Reaction is extremely acid to neutral throughout the profile.\nThe E horizon has hue from 5YR through 10YR, value moist from 4 through 7, and chroma moist from 1 to 3.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bhs horizon has a hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, and chroma moist from 0 to 2.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 10YR, value moist from 2 to 4 and chroma moist from 2 to 6.  Texture of the B horizons is silt loam or loam."

Karta soils are very gravelly and overlie compact glacial till on backslopes of mountainsides.  McGilvery soils consist of partially decomposed forest litter resting directly on bedrock on shoulderslopes of mountainsides.  Ulloa soils are deeper than 20 inches over bedrock and are on ridges, knobs and sideslopes. Wadleigh soils are poorly drained and overlie compact glacial till on footslopes of mountainsides."
