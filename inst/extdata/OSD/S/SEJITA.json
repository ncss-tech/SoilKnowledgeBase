  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline. Sodium saturation ratiois more than 15 percent in all horizons.  Clay content of the 10- to 40-inch particle size control section ranges from 25 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2. Texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.  Soil salinity ranges from 35 to 70 dS/m.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Soil salinity ranges from 16 to 32 dS/m.  Structure is weak angular blocky or weak prismatic.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Redoximorphic features range from few to common in shades of gray and brown.  This horizon consists of stratified loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, and clay loam.  Soil salinity ranges from 16 to 32 dS/m."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the only series in the family. Similar soils are the Arrada, Barrada, Latina, Saragosa, Satatton, Saucel, and Willamar series.  Arrada and Latina soils are in the fine-loamy family.  Barrada soils are in the fine family.  Saragosa soils have a gypsic horizon, gypsic mineralogy, and occur in saline basins of west Texas.  Satatton soils are in the sandy family.  Saucel soils are in the coarse-loamy family.  Willamar soils have a natric horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sejita soils occur on nearly level areas along the lower Gulf Coast.  Maximum elevation is about 7 feet.  They are subject to inundation during storm periods.  They have formed in stratified alluvial and marine sediments and have been modified by deposits of eolian silt and clay blown from nearby tidal flats.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 72 to 74 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 320 to 365 days, and elevation ranges from 2 to 7 feet. Thornthwaite P-E index is 32 to 40."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Barrada, Lomalta, Point Isabel, and Willamar series.  Barrada soils are at lower elevations near sea level.  Lomalta and Willamar soils are at higher elevations further inland.  Point Isabel soils are better drained, do not have mottled subsoils, and occupy \"clayey\" dune positions."
