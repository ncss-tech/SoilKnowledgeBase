  "OVERVIEW": "The Swartz series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments over basalt.  Swartz soils are in basins on lava plains and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry for 60 to 90 consecutive days within the four-month period following the summer solstice in most years.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Depth to the 2Bt horizon is 3 to 7 inches.  The A and Bt horizons are slightly acid or neutral and the BC and C horizons range from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  The material contains a significant amount of ash, but not enough to qualify as an ashy textural modifier.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  This material contains a significant amount of ash, but not enough to qualify as an ashy textural modifier.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  It is clay and has 40 to 65 percent clay.  It has moderate or strong columnar or prismatic structure parting to moderate or strong angular blocky.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  It is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam."
