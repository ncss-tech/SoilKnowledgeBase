  "OVERVIEW": "The Solarview series consists of shallow, excessively drained soils with rapid permeability that formed in colluvium from sandy lacustrine deposits. Slopes range from 35 to 65 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
