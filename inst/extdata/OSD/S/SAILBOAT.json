Mean annual precipitation is 13 to 20 inches.  The mean January temperature is 45 degrees F, mean July temperature is 75 degrees F and the mean annual temperature is 58 to 61 degrees F.

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; moderately slow permeability.  Occasional flooding occurs in unprotected areas and rare flooding occurs in protected areas during prolonged periods of rainfall in the winter and early spring months.  Flooding lasts from 2 to 30 days.  Some areas are drained due to ground water overdraft.  In areas along major rivers, a water table occurs from December through April at depths of 36 to 60 inches, due to seepage."
