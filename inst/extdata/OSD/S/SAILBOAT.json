  "OVERVIEW": "The Sailboat series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils which contain a buried soil and that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Sailboat soils are on natural levees and on low flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F.",

Occasional flooding occurs in unprotected areas and rare flooding occurs in protected areas during prolonged periods of rainfall in the winter and early spring months.  Flooding lasts from 2 to 30 days.  Some areas are drained due to ground water overdraft.  In areas along major rivers, a water table occurs from December through April at depths of 36 to 60 inches, due to seepage."
