  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F. These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between a depth of 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The upper 7 to 23 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.20 to 1.45 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples. The particle-size control section averages 2 to 8 percent clay and 55 to 70 percent sand with 45 to 55 percent coarser than very fine sand. It has 0 to 25 percent rock fragments. Reaction is slightly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist. Texture is ashy fine sandy loam or ashy sandy loam. It has 0 to 10 percent rock fragments.\nThe C horizon or E part of the E&Bt when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist. The Bt part has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist. The upper part of the C horizon or E&Bt horizon, to a depth of about 30 inches, is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, and has 0 to 25 percent rock fragments. The lower part of the C horizon or E&Bt horizon is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, gravelly fine sandy loam, or gravelly loamy fine sand. It has 0 to 30 percent rock fragments. When present, the combined thickness of the lamellae is less than 6 inches."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ardenmont, Cobbler, Downeygulch, Enson, Green Bluff, Labuck, Micapeak, and Quinnamose series. Ardenmont and Quinnamose soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Cobbler soils have subangular and angular rock fragments derived from colluvium of metamorphic origin, lack lamellae, and are in a 25 to 45 inch precipitation zone. Downeygulch soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Enson soils are dominated by rock fragments of granitic till origin although is similar to the Stapaloop soil. Labuck and Micapeak soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Similar soils with mixed mineralogy are the  Leadpoint, andWaits series. Leadpoint soils are 27 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Waits soils are very deep and have free carbonates in the particle-size control section. All are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Stapaloop soils are on terraces and footslopes and toeslopes of foothills at elevations of 1,900 to 4,800 feet. Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. These soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits or glacial till with a minor component of loess and volcanic ash in the surface. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 28 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 40 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 130 days."

Merkel soils are loamy-skeletal and are on mountains. Nevine soils are ashy over loamy-skeletal and are on moraines, foothills, and mountains.
