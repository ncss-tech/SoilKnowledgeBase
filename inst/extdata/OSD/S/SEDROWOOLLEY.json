  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 49 to 53 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 4 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Mottles with chroma of 2 or less are within 30 inches of the surface.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2, 3, or 4 moist and dry.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2, 3 or 4 moist, 2 or 3 dry.  Textures are silt loam, very fine sandy loam with some strata of fine sandy loam, or fine sand less than 5 inches thick."

These soils are in a cool marine climate with mild wet winters and cool dry summers.  The average annual rainfall ranges from 25 to 45 inches.  The average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 160 to 210 days."

Vernon soils are medial over loamy and have a mollic epipedon.  Skagit and Sumas soils have an aquic moisture regime.  In addition, Sumas soils are fine-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal."
