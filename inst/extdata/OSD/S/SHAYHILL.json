  "OVERVIEW": "The Shayhill series consists of very deep, well drained soils on escarpment toeslopes and escarpments. They formed in material weathered from basalt colluvium and residuum with a mixed mantle of volcanic ash and loess. Permeability is moderate. Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches.",
