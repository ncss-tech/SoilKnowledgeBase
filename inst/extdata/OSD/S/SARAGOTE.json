  "OVERVIEW": "The Saragote series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from metamorphic rocks.  Saragote soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 840 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.",
