They formed in colluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum weathered from Tertiary granitic sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, and fanglomerate.  Slopes are 20 to 65 percent.  Elevations range from 5,600 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.   The mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."
