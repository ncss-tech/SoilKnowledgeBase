  "OVERVIEW": "The Sedgran series consists of shallow or very shallow, excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from sandstone and granite.  Sedgran soils are on mountain slopes of 10 to 55 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.",
