These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon is 15 to 20 inches thick and includes part of the natric horizon.  Natric horizon has SAR of 13 to 30.  A thin B/E horizon is in some pedons just above the Btn horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 cry and 2 or 3 moist.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Btn has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It has prismatic, subangular blocky, or columnar structure.\nThe Btk horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
