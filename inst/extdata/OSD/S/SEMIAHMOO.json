  "OVERVIEW": "The Semiahmoo series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in herbaceous organic deposits. Semiahmoo soils are in depressions on glacial outwash plains and broad flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
