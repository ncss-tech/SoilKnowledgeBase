  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to carbonates ranges from 15 to 40 inches. These soils do not have rock fragments in the series control section.\nUncultivated pedons have an O horizon 1 to 3 inches thick. It is either well decomposed Oa horizon or a moderately decomposed Oe horizon. It has a hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. This is composed of remains of balsam fir and spruce needles, leaves from aspen, basswood, black ash, and elm, and forest floor flora.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 2 to 4 moist and 5 or less dry and chroma of 1 or 2. An A horizon 3 to 6 inches thick is in most uncultivated pedons. It has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1. Texture is silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. The A and E horizons are loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a B/E horizon with less than 15 percent E material present. Colors and textures of the B part are similar to those of the Btg horizon below and the E part to the E horizon above.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. The clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent. Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have BC horizons.\nThe C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silt loam, or silt. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline, and the calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 40 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils have plane or slightly concave slopes with gradients of 0 to 2 percent on nearly level undulating lake plains and ground moraines. These soils formed in silty, calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments that are associated with Late Wisconsin glaciation. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 30 inches. The frost-free period is 88 to 145 days. Elevation ranges from 800 to 1,600 feet above sea level."

Moderately well drained Baudette, somewhat poorly drained Littleswan and very poorly drained Sax soils form a hydrosequence with Spooner soils. Organic soils are also common associates."
