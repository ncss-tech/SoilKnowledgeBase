  "OVERVIEW": "The Stilgar series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium from andesite, basalt, tuff and breccias. Stilgar soils are on mountain side slopes. Slopes are 30 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 70 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

The umbric epipedon ranges from 15 to 20 inches in thickness. The particle-size control section averages 40 to 65 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe AB horizon, when present, has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Texture is very gravelly ashy sandy loam, gravelly ashy sandy loam or very gravelly ashy loam. It averages 40 to 55 percent gravel. Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry. Texture is very gravelly ashy loam, very gravelly ashy sandy loam, extremely gravelly ashy sandy loam or extremely cobble ashy sand loam, or extremely cobbly ashy loam. It averages 35 to 55 percent gravel and 0 to 35 percent cobbles. Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe 2BC horizon, when present, has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry. Texture is extremely cobbly loam, very cobbly loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly loam. It averages 35 to 45 percent gravel and 15 to 35 percent cobbles.

The climate is characterized by cool moist summers and cold wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 55 to 80 inches. The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F, and the average July temperature is about 60 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 37 to 43 degrees F.

Darland soils are on mountain side slopes,do not have andic soil properties and have a mollic epipedon. Jimek soils are on mountain side slopes and ridges and lack an umbric epipedon. Terence soils are on mountain side slopes, toeslopes, and ridges and have a surface layer less than 14 inches thick which meets andic soil properties."

Those pedons described with ash mantles between 30 and 36 inches thick will be considered as a taxadjunct to the series.\nAll depths to diagnostic horizons and features found in the range of characteristics are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
