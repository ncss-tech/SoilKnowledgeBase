  "OVERVIEW": "The Summertown series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over and mixed with till derived from volcanic rocks. Summertown soils are on moraines. Slopes range from 5 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches (1397 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F (4.5 degrees C).",
