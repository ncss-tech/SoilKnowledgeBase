  "OVERVIEW": "The Skymo series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium.  Skymo soils are found on slopes of 0 to 5 percent on flood plains and terraces of river valley bottoms.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,900 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
