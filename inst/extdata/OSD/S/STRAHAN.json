  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. JRW-JRN",
  "REVDATE": "03/2002",
  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Strahan series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in leached loess.  They typically occupy convex side slopes of uplands but are also on narrow interfluves.  They have moderate permeability.  Slopes range from 5 to 14 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness is less than 10 inches and corresponds to the thickness of the Ap or A1 horizon.  The depth to free carbonates ranges from 30 to 60 inches. Depth to carbonates typically decreases with increasing gradient on convex slopes.\nThe Ap horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) or brown (10YR 4/3).  Colors of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) make up as much as 30 percent of this horizon in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 25 percent.  The C horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline in the upper part and mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the lower part."

The mean annual temperature ranges from 49 to 56 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 26 to 32 inches."
