    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no series in the same family. Closely related soils are the Dreka, Guyton, Mantachie, Mhoon, Nahatche, Pophers, Rosebloom and Wehadkee series. Dreka soils are nonacid. Guyton soils have an argillic horizon and have intrusions of albic materials into the argillic horizon. Mhoon, Rosebloom, and Wedhadkee soils have mixed mineralogy; also Mhoon, Nahatche, and Wedhadkee soils have a nonacid particle-size control section. Mantachie and Nahatche soils have a browner subsoil and are somewhat poorly drained. Pophers soils do not have a perched water table."

The Bonn, Cart and Guyton soils are on slightly higher terrace positions with mounded surfaces. Bonn soils have a natric horizon and Cart and Guyton soils have an argillic horizon. The Iuka and Mathiston soils are on floodplain positions slightly above the Socagee soils and commonly along smaller streams. Iuka soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections and Mathiston soils are members of the Aeric subgroup. The Sardis soils are on slightly higher natural levee positions along stream channels. Sardis soils have a brownish cambic horizon and are somewhat poorly drained."

The duration of flooding is from a few hours to a few days. Flooding is mainly from January through May. A perched water table is at the surface to 1.5 feet from the surface during most years from December through May. Some spots are ponded with 2 to 10 inches of water for 1 to 4 weeks after heavy rains."

This soil has organic carbon content of more than 0.2 percent at a depth of 1.25 metersand, illuviated clay was identified in thin sections in the particle-size control section. It also has mottling, structure, and manganese concretions and masses in the particle-size control section.   The series was updated in 2004 to change the permeability class from moderate to moderately slow, as the interpretations for the series have always shown.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the type location pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 7 inches (A horizon).\nCambic horizon - 7 to 70 inches (Bg horizons)\nIrregular organic carbon distribution - 50 inches (greater than 0.2% OC).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Harrison County, Texas; TAMU Characterization Lab Number S86TX-203-1, 2, 3; S88TX-203-2, 3, 4; Soils Mechanics Lab.
