These soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone, dolomite, quartzite, shale, sandstone,welded tuff and a small component of volcanic glass. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations are 1,490 to 1,830 meters. The climate is cool semiarid. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm; the mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 130 to 150 days."
