  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Silent series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived from limestone dolomite, quartzite, shale, sandstone, welded tuff and a small component of volcanic glass. The Silent soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.",
