Adel, Bullrey, Duff, Gallatin, Hackwood, Lamphier, Leavittville, Mundos, Osmund, Pavohroo, Rhone and Taterheap soils have bedrock at a depth of 40 inches or more.  Karlan, Leavittville, Mundos, and Osmund soils have a Bk horizon.  Lespate soils have Bw horizons, and have Bk horizon above bedrock and lack evidence of clay films.  Secondset soils do not have Bt horizon and have mollic epipedon that are greater than 18 inches thick. Winevada soils lack a Bt horizon and lack clay films on peds and have a paralithic."
