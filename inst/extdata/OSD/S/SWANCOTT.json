Rock fragments, mainly gravel and cobbles, range from 5 through 65 percent in the mineral solum and from 35 through 75 percent in the substratum.\nMost pedons have an O horizon that is slightly, moderately or highly decomposed (fibric, hemic, sapric material). It has a hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 0 through 4. Reaction is ultra acid to extremely acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, loamy fine sand and loamy sand. It has granular or subangular blocky structure. It is very friable or friable. Reaction is extremely acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bhs or Bh, where present, horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam and loamy fine sand. It has granular or subangular blocky structure. It is very friable or friable. Reaction is extremely acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bs, where present, horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value or chroma of 4 or more. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand and loamy sand. It has granular or subangular blocky structure. It is very friable or friable.

The soils formed in water-sorted sand, gravel, cobbles, and stones of sedimentary origin. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1270 to 1727 mm., mean annual temperature ranges from 1 to 11 degrees C, and mean annual frost-free days ranges from 90 through 140 days. Elevation ranges from 305 to 610 meters above sea level."
