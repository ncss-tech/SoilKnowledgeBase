  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the underlying sand and gravel is 12 to 24 inches.  The content of gravel in the A, E, and Bt horizons ranges from 0 to 10 percent by volume.  The content of gravel ranges from 2 to 35 percent, by volume, in the 2Bt, 2BC, and 2C horizons.  The content of stones ranges from 0 to 1 percent in the Bt and 2C horizons.  The sand grains and rock fragments are 10 to 50 percent dark colored igneous and metamorphic and the remainder are light colored igneous and metamorphic.  The reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the profile.  Some areas have 0.1 to 3 percent of the surface covered with stones and boulders.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. Some pedons have Ap horizons with value of 5 or 6 when dry.  They are loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or the stony or very stony analogues of these textures.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or the stony or very stony analogues of these textures. Some pedons have EB, BE, or Bw horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  The Bt horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or the stony or very stony analogues of these textures.  It has 6 to 15 percent clay and 60 to 80 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe 2Bt horizon, when present, has colors similar to the Bt horizon.  It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, gravelly loamy sand, or gravelly loamy coarse sand.\nThe 2BC and 2C horizon have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6.  They are sand or coarse sand or their gravelly analogues."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are in the Balmlake, Bootlake, Bergkeller, Cunard, Emmet, Flak, Heyder, Milaca, Nadeau, Oconto, Omena, and Sugarbush series. Balmlake soils have hue of 10YR or yellower, moderate permeability, and less than 60 percent by volume fine sand and coarser in the argillic horizon.  Bergkeller soils have sandy material at a depth of 24 to 40 inches. Bootlake and Sugarbush soils have free carbonates within 60 inches.  Cunard soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Emmet, Flak, Heyder, and Milaca soils do not have sand and gravel within 60 inches.  Nadeau soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder in the control section and more than 35 percent by volume rock fragments in the lower part. Oconto soils have reaction of 7.4 or greater within 40 inches and are typically greater than 24 inches to sand and gravel.  Omena soils have less than 60 percent by volume fine sand and coarser in the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sanburn soils have plane to convex slopes on outwash plains, stream terraces, moraines, and valley trains. Slope gradients range from 0 to 30 percent.  They formed in a thin mantle of loamy sediment underlain by sandy and gravelly sediments.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 33 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 150. Elevation above sea level ranges from 700 to 1500 feet."
