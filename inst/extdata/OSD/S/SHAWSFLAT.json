  "OVERVIEW": "The Shawsflat series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium derived from latite over residuum weathered from volcanic sandstone. The Shawsflat soils are on side slopes of volcanic plateaus. Slopes range from 25 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 665 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C.",
