    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Shawsflat soils are on the side slopes of volcanic plateaus. Slopes range from 25 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium derived from latite over residuum weathered from volcanic sandstone. Elevation is 145 to 685 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 520 to 910 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 15 to 17 degrees C. The frost free season is 230 to 315 days."
