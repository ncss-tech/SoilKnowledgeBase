  "OVERVIEW": "The St. Martin series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils formed in colluvium from andesite.  St. Martin soils are on backslopes and toe slopes of mountains.  These soils are subject to mass movement.  Slopes are 2 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
