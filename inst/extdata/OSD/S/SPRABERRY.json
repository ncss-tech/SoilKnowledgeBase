  "OVERVIEW": "The Spraberry series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow, well drained, and moderately permeable above a very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon. These soils formed in calcareous, loamy eolian deposits in the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. Spraberry soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in) and the mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
