  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum and depth to shale bedrock are 20 to 40 inches.  The thickness of the loess mantle is 15 to 30 inches.  The thickness of the part of the solum in residuum is 6 to 18 inches.  Content of coarse fragments of shale, limestone, or sandstone ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick.  The average content of clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon is 35 to 50 percent.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Typically, it is silt loam, but silty clay loam is in the range.  It has weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure.  It is medium acid through neutral.\nThe part of the B horizon that formed in loess has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It has lower or higher chroma mottles than the matrix in most to all parts, and it must have low chroma mottles in the upper part if the hue is 10YR and the chroma is 3 or 4, or if the hue is 2.5Y and the chroma is 4.  It is heavy silt loam or silty clay loam.  It has moderate subangular blocky or prismatic structure.  It is friable or firm.  It has few through many thin or medium clay films on faces of peds in at least some part.  It is medium acid through neutral.\nThe IIB horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It has mottles in some to all parts.  It is silty clay or clay.  It has subangular blocky or prismatic structure that is moderate or strong in the upper part and weak or moderate in the lower part.  It is firm through extremely firm.  It has few through many thin through thick clay films.  It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe IICr horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, 5GY, or 5BG, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is clay or silty clay.  It is massive or has horizontal cleavage.  It has thin strata of sandstone or limestone in some pedons.  It has iron or manganese oxide masses or concretions in some pedons.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.  It lacks or has slight effervescence."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Denrock series in the same family and the Greenton, Kent, Loran, Schapville, and Snead series.  Denrock soils lack shale bedrock beginning between depths of 20 to 40 inches and have acid sola.  Greenton soils have thicker sola which is finer textured in the upper part and, in addition, lack a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Kent soils formed in residuum weathered partly from acid shale and partly from sandstone and, in addition, have more acid sola and a higher sand content in the lower B horizon.  Loran soils have a silt layer more than 30 inches thick and contain less clay in the series control section.  Schapville soils formed in similar soil material, but lack low chroma mottles within a depth of 6 inches below the lower boundary of the mollic epipedon.  Snead soils formed in residuum weathered from calcareous shale and have finer textures in the upper part of the solum and, in addition, lack argillic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shullsburg soils have plane or concave slopes on uplands and foot slopes of upland hills.  Slope gradients typically are 1 to 3 percent but range up to 25 percent.  These soils formed in silty sediments (loess) 15 to 30 inches thick and clayey residuum weathered from shale.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 35 inches.  The growing season ranges from 140 to 160 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Calamine, Derinda, Haverhill, and the competing Loran and Schapville soils.  Derinda soils have thinner or lighter-colored surface horizons.  Loran soils have silty surface layer greater than 30 inches thick.  The well and moderately well drained Schapville soils and the poorly and very poorly drained Calamine and Haverhill soils are in drainage sequence with the Shullsburg soils.  Haverhill soils lack or have a thinner mantle of loess."
