  "OVERVIEW": "The Soonahbe series consists of deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in loess and alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Soonahbe soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.",

The superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data."
