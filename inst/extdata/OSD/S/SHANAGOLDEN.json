  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the dense sandy or loamy till ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  Content of clay averages from 3 to 7 percent in the particle-size control section and the content of sand coarser than very fine averages 35 to 70 percent. Coarse fragments are dominantly of igneous origin and are of mixed lithology. Total volume of rock fragment ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the loamy alluvium, 0 to 25 percent in the loamy till, and 5 to 35 percent in the sandy till. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the loamy alluvium and 5 to 25 percent in the loamy till and from 5 to 30 percent in the sandy till. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 7 percent and volume of stones ranges from 0 to 3 percent throughout. Surface stones have coverage ranging from 0 to 3 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the loamy alluvium and loamy till and from strongly acid to slightly acid in the dense till. Masses of iron accumulations are below the spodic horizon but within 40 inches. Saturation occurs within 40 inches at some time in most years.\nSome pedons have an O horizon\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 2 to 3\nChroma: 1 or 2\nTexture: a mat of highly decomposed forest litter\nA horizon:\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 2 or 3\nChroma: 1 or 2\nTexture: fine sandy loam\nCultivated pedons have an Ap horizon:\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 3 or 4\nChroma: 2 or 3\nTexture: fine sandy loam\nSome pedons have E horizons:\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 4 or 5\nChroma: 2 or 3\nTexture: fine sandy loam or sandy loam\nBhs horizon:\nHue: 5YR or 7.5YR\nValue: 3\nChroma: 3\nTexture: fine sandy loam or sandy loam\nBs horizon:\nHue: 7.5YR\nValue: 3 or 4\nChroma: 3 or 4\nTexture: fine sandy loam or sandy loam\nShanagolden soils have a glossic horizon.  Horizonation has a wide range depending on the thickness of the loamy alluvium and degree to which eluviation has occurred.  Therefore, there can be E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons singularly or in combination.  The E part of the E/B or B/E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value, dry of 7 or more. The B part of the E/B or B/E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  The E part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizons has colors similar to the E described above.  The Bt part has colors similar to those of the 2Bt horizon described below.  Texture for the 2E/B or 2B/E is sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam. Bulk density ranges from 1.65 to 1.80 gm/cc in the glossic horizon. The B/E or 2B/E horizon does not have the clay increase to meet the requirements for an argillic horizon.\n2Bt horizon:\nHue: 5YR or 7.5YR\nValue: 4\nChroma: 3 or 4\nTexture: sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam\n3BCd and 3Cd horizons:\nHue: 5YR or 7.5YR\nValue: 4 or 5\nChroma: 3 or 4\nTexture: predominantly loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand, but some pedons have sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam textures\nClay content--2 to 7 percent\nMoist bulk density--1.85 to 2.00 gm/cc"

Permeability is moderate in the loamy alluvium, moderate or moderately slow in the loamy till, and slow in the dense till. Shanagolden soils have a seasonal perched water table at a depth of 2 to 3.5 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period September to June in normal years."

Common trees are red maple, sugar maple, eastern hemlock, paper birch, and northern red oak with eastern hop hornbeam, bigtooth aspen, white ash and yellow birch as associates in most stands. Some areas are cleared and used for pastureland or cropland. Corn, small grains, and hay are the common crops."

The 2Bt is considered argillic because of the lithologic discontinuity.\nThese soils may be in the early stages of fragipan development.  A decision was made to recognize these dense layers (2BCd and 2Cd) as densic material at this time.\nOnly series status, responsibility, and scrivener's errors changed - 4/09.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to soil survey sample number S03WI-003-013 for NSSL data on this pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
