These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Thickness of mixed ash mantle ranges from 7 to 14 inches. These layers have estimated moist bulk density of 0.85 to 1.15 g/cc, glass content of 20 to 35 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.5 to 1.10, phosphate retention of 25 to 40 percent and 15-bar water retention of 8 to 12 percent for air dried samples. The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist. Texture is very cobbly loam, extremely cobbly loam, very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly loam or very gravelly fine sandy loam. Rock fragments range from 35 to 70 percent."

Climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches. The average January temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 62 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.
