Thickness of the mantle of volcanic ash is 7 to 14 inches and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.. These soil are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 45 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Scrabblers soils are on outwash terraces and terrace escarpments at elevations of 1,900 to 4,500 feet. Slopes are smooth, rolling, or undulating and range from 0 to 65 percent. The soils formed in outwash derived mainly from weathered granitic rock and a mantle of volcanic ash and loess. The average annual temperature ranges from 42 degrees to 45 degrees F; the average annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 35 inches; and the frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."

Bonner soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal. Kegel soils have a mollic epipedon. Kiehl soils are sandy-skeletal. Manley soils are medial over loamy-skeletal and are cryic. Martella soils are fine-silty and have an argillic horizon. Merkel and Newbell soils are loamy-skeletal. Mobate soils are loamy-skeletal and are 10 to 20 inches deep. Moscow soils are coarse-loamy and are 20 to 40 inches deep."

Listed overstory and understory plants indicate a udic soil moisture regime; estimated actual precipitation as low 18 inches suggest a xeric soil moisture regime.\nScrabblers soils should be further investigated to determine typical mineralogy (isotic vs. mixed).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data available for soil survey sample numbers S01WA063009 and S02WA063003 Spokane County, Washington; 02N0120 and 03N0291 NSSL pedon numbers respectively.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
