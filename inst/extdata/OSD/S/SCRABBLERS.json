  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Scrabblers series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sandy glacial outwash derived from weathered granitic rocks with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess. Scrabblers soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments and have slopes of 0 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 27 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Listed overstory and understory plants indicate a udic soil moisture regime; estimated actual precipitation as low 18 inches suggest a xeric soil moisture regime.\nScrabblers soils should be further investigated to determine typical mineralogy (isotic vs. mixed).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data available for soil survey sample numbers S01WA063009 and S02WA063003 Spokane County, Washington; 02N0120 and 03N0291 NSSL pedon numbers respectively.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
