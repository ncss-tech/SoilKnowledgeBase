The soils are usually moist but are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 25 to 35 percent clay and has 35 to 80 percent rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 20 to 40 inches. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is gravelly loam averaging 15 to 25 percent clay.  It has 15 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 3 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly clay loam or extremely gravelly clay loam averaging 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 35 to 70 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.  Soil reaction is very strongly acid to strongly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Swedeheaven soils occur in open grassland areas on metastable ridgetops and south-facing side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types of the Dothan Formation.   Elevations are 300 to 3,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 130 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.   The frost-free period is 160 to 210 days."

Hazelcamp and Skookumhouse soils are clayey and have a paralithic bedrock contact.  Bravo, Cassiday and Fritsland soils are on side slopes of mountains.  Bravo and Cassiday soils have ochric epipedons.  In addition, Bravo soils are fine-loamy.  Fritsland soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock, have an ochric epipedon and are fine-loamy. Grouslous soils are on steep side slopes of mountains.  Grouslous soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to bedrock.  Quailprairie soils are greater than 60 inches deep to a bedrock contact and are fine-loamy. Quailprairie and Sankey soils occur in open grassland areas on ridgetops and south-facing side slopes of mountains.  Quailprairie soils are very deep to bedrock and are fine-loamy.  Sankey soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to bedrock."
