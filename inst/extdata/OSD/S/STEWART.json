  "OVERVIEW": "The Stewart soils occur on level to nearly level and gently sloping low terraces and alkali flats bordering large playas. These soils formed in old lake and fan deposited alluvium from mixed sources, including rhyolite, andesite, quartzite and granite. Mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches. Slopes are dominantly 0 to 1 percent and range from 0 to 5 percent.",

Slopes are dominantly 0 to 1 percent and range from 0 to 5 percent. Microrelief may be uneven due to wind shifting of the surface soil. These soils formed in old lake and fan deposited alluvium from mixed sources, including rhyolite, andesite, quartzite and granite. The climate is warm semiarid continental. The mean annual temperature ranges from 58 degrees to 66 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 155 to 220 days. The annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 12 inches and occurs as thundershowers from July through September and as gentle fall and winter rains. May and June are usually dry."
