  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alko (NV), Muroc (CA), Nebona (CA), and Zalda (NV) series. All these soils are well drained. In addition, they are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30), and are moist in some part of the moisture control section for 10 to 20 days cumulative during the period July through October. Muroc and Zalda soils are shallow to a thin duripan over bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Stewart soils are at elevations of 3,800 to 4,300 feet on level to nearly level and gently sloping low terraces and alkali flats bordering large playas. Slopes are dominantly 0 to 1 percent and range from 0 to 5 percent. Microrelief may be uneven due to wind shifting of the surface soil. These soils formed in old lake and fan deposited alluvium from mixed sources, including rhyolite, andesite, quartzite and granite. The climate is warm semiarid continental. The mean annual temperature ranges from 58 degrees to 66 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 155 to 220 days. The annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 12 inches and occurs as thundershowers from July through September and as gentle fall and winter rains. May and June are usually dry."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cogswell, Comoro, Elfrida and Karro soils in addition to the competing Crot, Duncan, Frye and Gothard soils. Cogswell and Elfrida soils have mollic epipedons and distinct zones of calcium carbonate accumulation. Comoro soils have mollic epipedons. Karro soils have distinct zones of calcium carbonate accumulation at shallow depths. None of the above listed soils have duripans at shallow depths."
