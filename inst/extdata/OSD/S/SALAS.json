  "OVERVIEW": "The Salas series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in very gravelly to very stony medium to moderately fine textured material from schist, gneiss, quartzite, and some granite. The soils are on hilly to very steep foothills and mountain slopes and have slopes that are dominantly 20 to 65 percent ranging from 15 to 85 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
