The slopes are dominantly 20 to 65 percent ranging from 15 to 85 percent.  The soils formed in very gravelly to very stony medium to moderately fine textured material from schist, gneiss, quartzite, and some granite.  The climate is semiarid continental.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is about 14 inches with a marked summer maximum.  The average annual temperature is about 52 degrees F."
