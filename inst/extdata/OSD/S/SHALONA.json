  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Shalona soils are on old high river terraces and alluvial flats on structural benches.  They are formed in mixed alluvium  and residuum from sandstone and shale. Elevation ranges from 5,000 to 7,000 feet. Average annual temperature ranges from 45 to 53 degrees F. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 18 inches and is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year. About half the precipitation falls between April and September with May and June being the driest months. The PE Index is 42 at the type location and ranges from 35 to 50 for the series.  The frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
