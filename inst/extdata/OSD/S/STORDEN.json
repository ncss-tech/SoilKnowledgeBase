    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Carbonates are in all horizons. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout. The profile has 2 to 10 percent by volume, rock fragments of mixed lithology.  The clay content of the particle size control section ranges from 18 to 27 percent and the sand content ranges from 30 to 40 percent. Clay sized carbonates make up 1 to 4 percent of the total clay content.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loam, silt loam or clay loam.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y with value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loam or clay loam. Redoximorphic features are relict in this horizon. The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 25 percent and is 5 percent or more than the C horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. The texture is loam or clay loam. It has 18 to 30 percent clay and less than 40 percent total sand. The moderately coarse substratum phase has textures of loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam. It has 12 to 22 percent clay and more than 40 percent total sand. The moderately fine substratum phase has textures of loam or clay loam. It has 20 to 30 percent clay and less than 45 percent total sand. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Redox features are considered as relic as they do not relate to present day soil saturation. It is friable or firm based on the geomorphic surface it occurs on."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are the Gardenisle and Hennepin series. Gardenisle soils have a lithic contact at depths of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Hennepin soils do not have an accumulation of secondary carbonates below the ochric epipedon."

They formed in calcareous, loamy, Des Moines Lobe glacial till of Late Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from7 to 10 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 635 to 813 mm (25 to 32 inches). Frost-free period ranges from 155 to 200 days. Elevation ranges from 244 to 479 m (800 to 1,570 feet)."

The well drained Belview and Swanlake soils have a mollic epipedon. The well drained Clarion and Omsrud soils have a mollic epipedon and are not calcareous in the upper part. Delft and Webster soils are poorly drained and on footslopes and swales. Nicollet soils are on lower summits or sideslope positions and are somewhat poorly drained."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon-the zone from the surface to 18 cm (7 inches) (Ap horizon); cambic horizon-the zone from 18to 140 cm (7 to 55 inches) (Bk horizons); udic moisture regime.\nCurrently, a firm clay loam till C horizon is associated with the Gary moraine in Minnesota. A friable loam till C horizon is associated with the Bemis and Altamont moraines in Minnesota. A glacial till study and distribution of similar soils by geomorphic areas in Minnesota and Iowa is needed to more accurately characterize this series by landform\nThe redoximorphic features occurring in these soils do not reflect present day soil saturation for one month or more.\nWhere Storden soils are not cultivated, the Belview series should be considered as they have a mollic epipedons.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Record MN0063.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
