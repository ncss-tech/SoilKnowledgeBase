Easychair soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms.  Rosney soils are influenced by volcanic ash, have secondary gypsum crystals, and have mean annual soil temperatures of 8 to 11 degrees C.  Sagrlite soils have calcium carbonate equivalent of 10 to 20 percent and formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Sain and Timpie soils have calcium carbonate equivalent of 15 to 40 percent."

Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 1,189 to 1,341 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 180 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."
