  "OVERVIEW": "The Swingler series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Swingler soils are on basin-floor remnants and fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",

Easychair soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms.  Rosney soils are influenced by volcanic ash, have secondary gypsum crystals, and have mean annual soil temperatures of 8 to 11 degrees C.  Sagrlite soils have calcium carbonate equivalent of 10 to 20 percent and formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Sain and Timpie soils have calcium carbonate equivalent of 15 to 40 percent."
