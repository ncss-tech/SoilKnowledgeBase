  "OVERVIEW": "The Slights series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in clayey alluvium with loess in the upper part. These soils are in basins and on hills and mountain slopes. Slopes are 2 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
