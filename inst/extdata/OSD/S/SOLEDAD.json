Ashmed soils have a SAR of 13 to 35 in the argillic horizon. Bitter soils are less than 30 inches deep to the base of the argillic and have loamy sand and sand textures below the argillic. Bluebird soils are less than 23 inches to the base of the argillic. Highland soils have a lithic contact within 40 inches. Khyber soils are dominated by 2 to 5 millimeter gravel and have secondary silica cementation in the lower part of the subsoil. Nellake soils average less than 20 percent clay in the argillic horizon and less than 15 percent clay in the subsoil. Timosea soils are dry in the soil moisture control section from May to December. Twobitter soils have accumulations of gypsum in the particle-size control section. Topawa soils have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and mean annual soil temperatures of 69 to 72 degrees F."

The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nADDITIONAL DATA: The typical pedon was sampled as pedon S67NM-7-4.  (L.H. Gile and R.B. Grossman, 1979;  The Desert Project Soil Monograph.  Document PB80-135304.  National Technical Information Service, Springfield, Va.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
