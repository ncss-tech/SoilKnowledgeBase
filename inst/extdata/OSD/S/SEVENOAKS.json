The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel.  It has 1 to 3 percent organic matter.  It is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.

Francis soils are mildly to moderately alkaline and are loamy fine sand or fine sand in the particle-size control section.  La Posta soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact.  Wasatch soils contain less than 15 percent gravel in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sevenoaks soils are on low stream terraces at elevations of 1,000 to 1,500 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources and mixed with various amounts of pumice sand.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches.  The frost-free period is 150 to 180 days."

Evans and Newberg soils are coarse-loamy and subject to flooding.  Foehlin soils are fine-loamy and have an argillic horizon.  Takilma soils are loamy-skeletal."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The classification was changed in 2006 from a sandy, mixed, mesic Entic Haploxerolls to the Psammentic Haploxerools family using the 9th edition of keys to taxonomy. Competing series were not checked at that time. Although the series contains appreciable amounts of volcanic ash and pumice, there isnt enough to change the classification.\nDiagnostic horizons and features:\nMollic epipedon - from the surface to a depth of 14 inches; (Ap1 and Ap2).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
