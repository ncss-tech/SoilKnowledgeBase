  "OVERVIEW": "The Sevenoaks series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on low stream terraces.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources and mixed with various amounts of pumice sand.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

Competing series were not checked at that time. Although the series contains appreciable amounts of volcanic ash and pumice, there isnt enough to change the classification.\nDiagnostic horizons and features:\nMollic epipedon - from the surface to a depth of 14 inches; (Ap1 and Ap2).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
