The moisture regime is aridic bordering on ustic.\nThese soils have 5 to 60 percent pebbles and channer size caliche fragments on the surface.  The particle-size control section ranges from 5 to 18 percent clay.  Depth to unweathered sandstone ranges from 10 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has value 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is noncalcareous to moderately calcareous, and mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Rock fragments are dominantly less than 30 percent.\nThe B horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It commonly is fine sandy loam, loam, and sandy loam.  The B horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline, and noncalcareous to moderately calcareous.  Angular pebbles and channer size rock fragements are less than 10 percent by volume.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 8 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam, or gravelly fine sandy loam.  The Cca horizon is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline, and the calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 40 percent.  It has angular pebbles and channer size rock fragments ranging from 15 to 35 percent by volume with moderately thick pendants of calcium carbonate."
