  "REVDATE": "06/2015",
  "STATES": "IL,IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Saude series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of stratified loamy alluvium and the underlying loamy sand and sandy and gravelly sediments. These soils are on treads and risers on stream terraces in river valleys and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 875 millimeters.",
