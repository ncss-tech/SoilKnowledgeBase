They formed in gypsum beds which were precipitated from fluctuating saline water tables.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 12 inches, mean annual air temperature ranges from 63 to 67 degrees F.  Frost free season ranges from 210 to 240 days, and elevation ranges from 2,500 to 4,000 feet."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Orla and Reeves series, and the Hoban and Monahans series.  Hoban and Monahans soils do not have a salic horizon and have mixed mineralogy, and in addition, Hoban soils have a calcic horizon and Monahans soils are in the coarse-loamy family.  All of these soils are on slightly higher positions."
