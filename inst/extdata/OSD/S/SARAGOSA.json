  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Saragosa series consists of soils that are shallow to gypsiferous materials.  They are poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy gypsiferous materials of lacustrine origin.  These soils are in nearly level to slightly depressed areas in large saline basins.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.",

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 12 inches, mean annual air temperature ranges from 63 to 67 degrees F.  Frost free season ranges from 210 to 240 days, and elevation ranges from 2,500 to 4,000 feet."

Hoban and Monahans soils do not have a salic horizon and have mixed mineralogy, and in addition, Hoban soils have a calcic horizon and Monahans soils are in the coarse-loamy family.  All of these soils are on slightly higher positions."
