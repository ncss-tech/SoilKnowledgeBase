    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sylvan soils are on convex side slopes on loess covered till plains and risers on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent on till plains and from 2 to 10 percent on the stream terraces.  Sylvan soils formed in more than 203 cm (7 feet) of calcareous loess.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2  to 13.9 degrees C (45 to 57 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1143 mm (30 to 45 inches), frost free days range from 140 to 200 days, and elevation ranges from 106 to 412 meters (350 feet to 1350 feet) above sea level."

(A, E1 and E2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from approximately 25 to 58 cm (10 to 23 inches).
