  "OVERVIEW": "The Scheiner series consist of very deep, well drained soils formed in glaciofluvial material with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part. These soils are on steep drainage sideslopes and terrace escarpments. Slopes are 35 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the average annual temperature is 39 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days following the summer solstice. The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.00 to 1.35 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples. The particle-size control system averages from 5 to 30 percent coarse fragments. Some pedons lack a C horizon. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe 2A horizon has a value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist. It is ashy sandy loam or gravelly ashy sandy loam. It has 5 to 15 percent pebbles.\nThe 3C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is loamy sand, sand, gravelly sand, or coarse sand. It has 0 to 30 percent pebbles and 0 to 10 percent cobbles."
