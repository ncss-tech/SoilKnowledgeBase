Mean annual precipitation is 1650 to 2290 millimeters (65 to 90 inches). Mean winter soil temperature (December, January, and August) is approximately 9 degrees C; mean summer soil temperature (June, July, and August) is approximately 14 degrees C; and the mean annual soil temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F).

Footstep and Stonehill are 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) to bedrock. Ladybird and Sasquatch are fine-loamy. Yeti is fine. The Footstep and Stonehill soils are on strongly convex slopes or on spur ridges above Sisterrocks soils. The Ladybird soils are on linear to concave positions. The Sasquatch soils are alongside the Sisterrocks soils on colluvium of lower rock content. The Yeti soils are in concave positions."
