  "OVERVIEW": "The Solitude series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils in areas adjacent to saline marshes, flats, and ponds.  They formed in marine sediments at the mouth of guts.  The mean annual temperature is about 80 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",
