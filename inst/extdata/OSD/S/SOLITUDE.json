Carib soils are in flood plains and have a mollic epipedon.  Cinnamon Bay and Glynn soils are on higher terrace positions, are well drained, and have mollic epipedons.  Jaucas and Redhook soils are on slightly higher positions, are excessively drained, and sandy throughout.  Sandy Point and Sugar Beach soils are on slightly lower positions and are very poorly drained.  In addition, Sandy Point soils have marine sediments overlying organic material and Sugar Beach soils are organic throughout."
