  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Shinkee soils are in fresh water marshes and river channels of the San Joaquin - Sacramento Delta.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.  They formed in hydrophytic plant remains over mixed mineral alluvium.  The organic material is derived from tule and reed fibers.  Elevations are 15 feet below sea level to 5 feet above sea level and are on islands protected by levees.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation varies from 12 to 16 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 43 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 73 degrees F; mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 260 to 300 days."

The Dello, Itano and Valdez soils are on old river channels and Egbert, Peltier, Ryde and Scribner soils are on flood plains.  Dello soils are sandy mineral soils.  Egbert and Scribner are mineral soils with less than 10 percent weighted average organic matter content in the 10 to 40 inch zone.  Egbert is fine and Scribner is fine-loamy.  Itano and Valdez are mineral soils that have fine-silty control sections.  Peltier and Ryde are mineral soils with 10 to 25 or 30 percent weight average organic matter content in the 10 to 40 inch zone.  Peltier is fine and Ryde is fine-loamy."
