  "OVERVIEW": "The Strawn series consists of very deep, well drained soils on end moraines and dissected ground moraines. They are moderately permeable in the solum and moderately or moderately slowly permeable in the substratum. Strawn soils formed in loamy, calcareous till. Slope ranges from 2 to 75 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 inches).",

All of these soils are differentiated by having sola thicker than 61 cm (24 inches) except Belmore, Hollinger, Kidder, LeRoy, Lumberton, Mandeville, Military, Mocksville, Pignut, and Relay. Belmore soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in some layer in the middle or lower part of the series control section. Hollinger soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 61 cm (24 inches) and have a higher content of mica in the series control section. Kidder soils contain more than 35 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the argillic horizon. Leroy soils have a calcium carbonate equivalent of more than 40 percent in lower part of the series control section. Lumberton, Mandeville, Military, and Pignut soils have a lithic or paralithic contact within a depth of 151 cm (60 inches). Mocksville soils formed in weathered residuum from metamorphic or igneous rocks. Relay soils have hues yellower than 10YR and contain magnesium-rich rock fragments dominated by gabbro, metagabbro or granodiorite."
