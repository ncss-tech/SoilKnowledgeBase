    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Amanda, Belmont, Belmore, Caprell, Chili, Cliftycreek, Conestoga, Crouse, Gallman, Greybrook, Hickory, High Gap, Hollinger, Kanawha, Kidder, Kosciusko, Leroy, Lumberton, Mandeville, Martinsville, Military, Mocksville, Ockley, Pignut, Princeton, Relay, Richardville, Riddles, Senachwine, Skelton, Wawaka, Wawasee, and Woodbine series. All of these soils are differentiated by having sola thicker than 61 cm (24 inches) except Belmore, Hollinger, Kidder, LeRoy, Lumberton, Mandeville, Military, Mocksville, Pignut, and Relay. Belmore soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in some layer in the middle or lower part of the series control section. Hollinger soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 61 cm (24 inches) and have a higher content of mica in the series control section. Kidder soils contain more than 35 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the argillic horizon. Leroy soils have a calcium carbonate equivalent of more than 40 percent in lower part of the series control section. Lumberton, Mandeville, Military, and Pignut soils have a lithic or paralithic contact within a depth of 151 cm (60 inches). Mocksville soils formed in weathered residuum from metamorphic or igneous rocks. Relay soils have hues yellower than 10YR and contain magnesium-rich rock fragments dominated by gabbro, metagabbro or granodiorite."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Strawn soils formed in loamy calcareous till. Some pedons have a thin mantle of loess. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 1016 mm (29 to 40 inches), mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 12 degrees C (45 to 54 degrees F), frost free period ranges from 160 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 104 to 311 meters (340 to 1,020 feet) above mean sea level."

Chute and Hennepin soils do not have argillic horizons, are on similar landforms or nearby slopes, and in places are intricately mixed with Strawn soils. Senachwine soils have thicker sola and are on similar positions."
