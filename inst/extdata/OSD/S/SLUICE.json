  "OVERVIEW": "The Sluice series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in materials weathered from ash cemented conglomerates on strongly rolling uplands at elevations ranging from 4,800 to 5,500 feet. Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches and mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F. Mean summer temperature is 58 to 64 degrees F.",
