Depth to the Ck horizon is 12 to 16 inches. Mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F. and average summer soil temperature is 55 to 59 degrees F. The hue is 10YR through 5YR in the A horizon and 5YR through 10R in the B and C horizons.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe A2 and Bt horizons have value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 4 through 6.\nThe Bt horizon is clay loam or gravelly clay loam to clay or gravelly clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe Ck horizon has an estimated 5 to 10 percent CaC03 equivalent. Clay content is 18 to 27 percent."
