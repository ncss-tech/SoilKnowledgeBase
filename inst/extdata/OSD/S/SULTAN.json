  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 47 to 52 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 3 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days during the summer.  The particle-size control section averages less than 5 percent coarse fragments, less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand, and has 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has moderate to weak structure.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. It has moderate or weak structure.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 moist, 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.  Textures is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or silty clay loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 moist, 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 0 to 2 moist or dry.   Texture is stratified and ranges from silt loam to sand.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Sultan series are in the parts of river valleys that have slightly undulating microrelief at elevations ranging from near sea level to 120 feet.  They formed in stratified loamy alluvium.  The climate is marine.  Average January temperature is 38 degrees F, average July temperature is 64 degrees F, and mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 55 inches and most of it falls as rain during winter.  Snow is infrequent.  The frost-free season ranges from 150 to 200 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Nooksack, Pilchuck, Puget, Puyallup, and Woodinville soils.  Nooksack soils are coarse-silty and have a mollic epipedon.  Pilchuck soils are sandy.  Puyallup soils have a mollic epipedon and are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Woodinville soils have an aquic moisture regime and thin lenses of organic material within the series control section."

Native vegetation consists of Douglas-fir, red alder, and western redcedar with an understory of Douglas spirea, trailing blackberry, salmonberry, thimbleberry. Oregon-grape, willow, western swordfern, vine maple, and tree seedlings."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Classification updated 3/94 and 1/00 because of amendments to Soil Taxonomy.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the surface to 9 inches, a cambic horizon from 9 to 24 inches, a particle-size control section that is assumed to have an irregular decrease in organic carbon and the soil is assumed to have more than 0.2 percent organic carbon from 50 to 60 inches.  Base saturation is less than 60 percent (NH4Oac) from 10 to 30 inches and is based on lab data from the associated Puget series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
