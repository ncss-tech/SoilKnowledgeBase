Content of pebbles ranges from 0 to 15 percent, by volume.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, and gray range from none to common.  Soft masses of iron and manganese range from none to common.  Content of pebbles ranges from 0 to 15 percent, by volume.\nThe O'a horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2.

The average annual temperature ranges from 76 to 82 degrees F., and the mean annual rainfall is about 40 inches."

Cinnamon Bay and Glynn soils are on higher positions, and are well drained mineral soils.  Jaucas soils are on slightly higher positions, are excessively drained, and sandy throughout.  Solitude soils are on slightly higher positions, are mineral soils, and are somewhat poorly drained.  Sandy Point soils are on similar positions but are mineral soils."
