  "OVERVIEW": "The Sugar Beach series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils in saline marshes adjacent to the sea.  They formed in organic materials consisting of the remains of hydrophytic plants.  Near the type location, the mean annual air temperature is about 80 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

Content of pebbles ranges from 0 to 15 percent, by volume.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, and gray range from none to common.  Soft masses of iron and manganese range from none to common.  Content of pebbles ranges from 0 to 15 percent, by volume.\nThe O'a horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2.

Solitude soils are on slightly higher positions, are mineral soils, and are somewhat poorly drained.  Sandy Point soils are on similar positions but are mineral soils."
