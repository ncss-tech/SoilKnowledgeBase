The texture throughout is clay loam, silty clay loam, or loam with calcium carbonate equivalent of 40 to 70 percent.  Limestone or siliceous pebbles comprises 0 to 15 percent by volume.  Silicate clay is 18 to 35 percent, and carbonate clay is 2 to 10 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.\nThe Bk and BCk horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Some pedons have gravel beds below a depth of 50 inches."

The soil formed in limy and loamy alluvial sediments.  The climate is subhumid with an average rainfall of 28 to 36 inches and within Thornthwaite P-E indices of 42 to 56.  The mean average temperature is 65 to 69 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 230 to 260 and elevation ranges from 400 to 1200 feet."
