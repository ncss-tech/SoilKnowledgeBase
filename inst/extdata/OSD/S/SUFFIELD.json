  "OVERVIEW": "The Suffield series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in lacustrine or marine sediments.  They are mainly on gently sloping to very steep dissected plains.  They typically have silt loam A and B horizons over a silty clay 2C horizon.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and slow or very slow in the substratum.  Slope ranges from 3 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 42 inches and the mean annual temperature is 51 degrees F..",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the lithologic discontinuity ranges from 18 to 40 inches.  The soil has 0 to 3 percent gravel of granite or quartzite.  The soil ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid in the upper part of the solum and moderately acid through neutral in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Undisturbed soils have an A horizon, 1 or 2 inches thick.  It has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nAn E horizon up to 2 inches thick is in some pedons.\nThe B horizon above the lithologic discontinuity has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 8.  Texture is silt loam with less than 18 percent clay.  Some pedons have a 2B horizon with hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  Very thin clay films in pores and on vertical faces of peds are in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay, and has firm or very firm consistence."

Belgrade, Hartland, Scio, and Unadilla series have less than 18 percent clay in the control sections.  Berlin, Boxford, and Buxton soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control sections.  Elmridge and Melrose soils have fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam sola.  Boothbay and Brancroft soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Suffield soils are gently sloping to very steep soils on the tops and sides of ridges in dissected marine and lacustrine plains.  Slope gradients are commonly 8 to 20 percent, but they may range from 3 to 45 percent or more on ridge sides and escarpment margins.  The soils formed in marine or lacustrine sediments consisting of a silt loam mantle over silty clay loam or silty clay materials.  Climate is humid and cool temperate.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 55 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 55 inches; and mean growing season ranges from l20 to l80 days."

Agawam soils have a fine sandy loam solum over sandy substratum.  The very poorly drained Maybid and poorly drained Scitico soils are members of the Suffield drainage catena. Windsor soils are sandy throughout."

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 7 inches (Ap horizon).\n2.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 7 to 35 inches (Bw1, Bw2 and Bw3 horizons).\n3.  Contrasting particle size class - the zone from 10 to 35 inches is silt loam with less than 18 percent clay and the 35 to 40 inch zone has more than 35 percent clay.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
