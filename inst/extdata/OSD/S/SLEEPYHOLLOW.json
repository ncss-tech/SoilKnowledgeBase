These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from interbedded siltstone, fine-grained sandstone, and mudstone.  The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 890 to 2030 millimeters. Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C, and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C. Frost free season is about 275 to 330 days."
