    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sedgway soils are on slightly convex to concave mountain slopes and foothills at elevations of 6,000 to 8,500 feet.  Slopes range from 8 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from a variety of sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks with some loess influence in the upper part.  The average annual temperature ranges from 36 to 41 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 30 inches.  The frost-free season is less than 60 days."

Beaverdam soils have fine particle-size control sections.  Cedarhill and Ireland soils have calcic horizons and frigid temperature regimes.  Greys soils are fine-silty.  Harkness and Mikesell soils lack mollic epipedons.  Toponce soils are pachic and have fine particle-size control sections.  The Beaverdam soil is on mountain slopes but usually occupies a more concave position lower on the slope.  The Cedarhill and Ireland soils are on south or west aspects on mountain slopes.  The Greys and Toponce soils are at lower elevations on mountain footslopes of less than 30 percent.  The Harkness and Mikesell soils are on mountain slopes at higher elevations."
