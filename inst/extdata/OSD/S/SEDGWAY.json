  "OVERVIEW": "The Sedgway series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability.  They are on mountain slopes and foothills.  They formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium from a variety of sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks with some loess influence in the upper part.  Slopes range from 8 to 60 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 660 millimeters and the average annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",

Harkness and Mikesell soils lack mollic epipedons.  Toponce soils are pachic and have fine particle-size control sections.  The Beaverdam soil is on mountain slopes but usually occupies a more concave position lower on the slope.  The Cedarhill and Ireland soils are on south or west aspects on mountain slopes.  The Greys and Toponce soils are at lower elevations on mountain footslopes of less than 30 percent.  The Harkness and Mikesell soils are on mountain slopes at higher elevations."
