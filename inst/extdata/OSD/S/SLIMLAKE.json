  "STATES": "WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Slimlake series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in a thin layer of loamy alluvium and in the underlying stratified sandy glacial outwash on outwash plains, stream terraces, and moraines. These soils have moderate or moderately rapid permeability in the loamy mantle and rapid or very rapid permeability in the sandy outwash. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
