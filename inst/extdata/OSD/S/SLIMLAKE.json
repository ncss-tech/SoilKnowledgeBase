    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the loamy mantle and depth to stratified sandy outwash ranges from 10 to 24 inches. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the loamy mantle. Volume of gravel ranges from 10 to 25 percent in the sandy outwash as a weighted average, but ranges from 0 to 40 percent in individual strata. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is sandy loam.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is loamy sand or sand and the gravelly analogs.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is sand, coarse sand or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs and typically includes thin strata of loamy sand. Total sand content is over 90 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on outwash plains, stream terraces, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. They formed in 10 to 24 inches of loamy alluvium and the underlying sandy outwash. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 43 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 27 to 31 inches. The frost-free period ranges from about 100 to 130 days. Elevation ranges from 1,000 to 1,300 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cress, Wurtsmith, and Spoonerhill(T) soils. The somewhat excessively drained Cress soils are on slightly higher landscape positions. The moderately well drained Wurtsmith soils are on adjacent areas where the loamy mantle is absent. The moderately well drained Spoonerhill(T) soils are on nearby landscapes where the Spoonerhill(T) soils formed in sandy glacial till."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Surface runoff is slow. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy mantle and rapid or very rapid in the sandy outwash. Slimlake soils have a seasonal high water table at depths of 2.5 to 3.5 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period of September to June in normal years."
