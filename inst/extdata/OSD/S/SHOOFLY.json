  "OVERVIEW": "The Shoofly series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils on alluvial fans and piedmont slopes.  They formed in mixed alluvium from extrusive rocks.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
