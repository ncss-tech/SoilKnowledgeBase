  "OVERVIEW": "The Silver Creek series includes very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains or low stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C. (51 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation is about 58 centimeters (23 inches) at the type location.",
