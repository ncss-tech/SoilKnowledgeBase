  "OVERVIEW": "The Sanborn series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in calcareous, stratified loamy and sandy alluvium on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 43 centimeters (17 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C. (52 degrees F).",
