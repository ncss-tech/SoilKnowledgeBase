  "OVERVIEW": "The Supan series comprises Pachic Argixerolls of a fine-loamy mixed, mesic family.  The soils have brown, near reddish brown slightly acid sola with loam A horizons, clay loam Bt horizons and gravelly B3 horizons that rest at moderate depths, rather abruptly on partly weathered rock.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are about neutral or slightly acid throughout although the lower solum may be moderately acid.  Soil depth is mostly in the range of 30 inches to 48 inches.  Colors are for dry soil; moist colors may be one hue (1/4 letter interval) redder and normally are one or more values darker.\nThe A horizon is brown or dark brown of 7.5YR or 10YR hue, rarely of 5YR hue; massive, platy, or weak granular; loam or gravelly loam.  The transition to the B2t horizon is gradual through an A3 or B1 horizon or both.  The B2t horizon most commonly is the same color as the A horizon but may be one unit in value darker and may be 1 or 2 units of chroma higher.\nThe B2t horizon is heavy clay loam or clay and the structure is subangular blocky.  The B3 horizon is the same color as the B2t horizon but has a coarser texture, loam or light clay loam, is nearly massive, and is less porous than the horizons above."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Auburn, Guenoc, Inks, Parrish, Rescue, and Trabuco series.  The Auburn soils are shallow over bedrock and the Guenoc soils have very cobbly or very gravelly clay loam Bt horizons.  The Parrish soils have strongly acid Bt horizons.  The Rescue soils have yellowish red A horizons and red fine loamy argillic horizons.  Trabuco soils have thinner A horizons lower in organic matter, abrupt AB boundaries and are in a thermic family."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevation range from 1,500 to 4,000 feet.  The climate is moist, subhumid mesothermal with mean annual rainfall of 30 to 45 inches, warm dry summer and cool wet winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F., average January temperature about 40 degrees F., and average July temperature about 68 degrees F."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Supan series was formerly classified in the Noncalcic Brown group.  The present classification is based on a cumulic mollic epipedon, a fine argillic horizon, and a mean annual temperature between 47 degrees and 59 degrees F.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in February of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nOSED scanned by SSQA.  Last revised by state on 5/65.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
