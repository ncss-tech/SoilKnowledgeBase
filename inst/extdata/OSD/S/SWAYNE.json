  "OVERVIEW": "The Swayne series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess, alluvium and material weathered from granite.  Swayne soils are on mountain ridges and benches, and canyon slopes on plateaus and have slopes of 10 to 55 percent.  They have slow permeability.  The average annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
