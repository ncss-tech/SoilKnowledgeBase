  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness ranges from 2O to 4O inches and depth to bedrock is more than 5 feet.  Reaction throughout the soil ranges from strongly to extremely acid; where limed, the upper part of the solum ranges to neutral.  Sandstone and siltstone pebbles and fragments range from O to 15 percent by volume in the solum and from O to 4O percent in the C horizons.\nThe Ap and AB horizons, when present, have hue of 1OYR or 2.5Y, values of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4 and most pedons are mottled in shades of brown or gray.  They are fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam and have weak or moderate fine or medium granular structure.  Some pedons have A horizons 1 to 4 inches thick with values of 3 and some have AB horizons 5 to 1O inches thick with colors like that described for the Ap horizon.\nThe Bw horizons have hues of 1OYR or 2.5Y, values of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4, or values of 6 or 7 and chroma of 3 or 4. Mottles are in shades of gray or brown.  They are fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam, and have weak, fine through coarse, subangular blocky or granular structure.\nThe Bg horizons have hues of 1OYR through 5Y, values of 6 or 7 and chroma of 2 or less, or values of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or less, and hue of 5Y, values of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or less. Mottles are in shades of gray or brown.  Texture and structure is like the Bw horizon.\nThe Cg horizons have colors like the Bg and are fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam, and their gravelly or channery analogues. Some pedons are loamy sand below a depth of 3O inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing soils in the same family with Stokly.  Atkins, Bonnie and Stendal soils are in similar families.  Atkins and Bonnie soils have B horizons in which the dominant chroma of the matrix is 2 or less and have more than 18 percent clay in their particle-size control sections.  The Stendal soils have silt loam or silty clay loam textures to a depth of 4O inches or more."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stokly soils are on nearly level floodplains of small streams.  The soils formed in alluvium from acid sandstone, siltstones, and shales.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 4O to 45 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the  Atkins, Bonnie, and Stendal soils which have more clay, and the Cotacco and Pope soils. The Cotacco soils have argillic horizons and are moderately well drained.  The Pope soils are well drained and lack grayish colors in the solum."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",

Stokly soils are subject to common flooding of very brief duration, February through May, and have an apparent water table within O.5 to 1.O feet of the surface, February through May."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  If the Stokly soils are permitted to become air-dry and then re-wetted, the matrix colors in the lower part of the solum have chroma of more than 2.  It is theorized that the oxidation of the iron imparts brighter color to the soil.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in the pedon are:\nOchric epipedon, 0 to 8 inches, Ap\nAquic moisture regime at 19 to 76 inches (Bg,Cg)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
