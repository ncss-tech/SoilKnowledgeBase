  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The control section is clay and contains 50 to 65 percent clay.  The depth to bedded shale ranges from 6 to 20 inches.  Horizons above the shale range from loose to hard when dry, and friable or firm when moist.  These horizons contain free carbonates.  Effervescence ranges from slight to strong and reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The C1 and C2 horizons and upper part of the Cr horizons commonly have accumulations of carbonate, gypsum, and other salts.  Colors throughout, including mottles and stains, are inherited from the shale.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or 10YR, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam or clay loam and commonly contains few to common fragments of shale ranging from 2 to 25 mm in diameter.  It has fine or medium subangular blocky or fine or very fine granular structure.  The upper 1/4 to 1/2 inch commonly is a fragile crust or mulch or very fine granules when dry.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or 10YR, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It contains up to 35 percent fragments of shales by volume that range from less than 2 mm to 30 mm in diameter.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay.  The C horizon contains from 35 to more than 50 percent fragments of shale by volume that range from less than 2 mm to 35 mm in diameter.\nThe Cr horizon has the same range in color as the overlying C horizons.  It ranges from medium acid to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Samsil soils are on gently sloping to very steep hills, ridges and breaks of dissected shale plains.  Surfaces mainly are convex, and slope gradients range from 2 to 60 percent or more.  The soil formed in alluvium or residuum weathered from shale.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 19 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cromack, Fairburn, Kyle, Nunn, Pierre, Satanta and Swanboy soils.  Cromack and Pierre soils have bedrock between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  In addition, Cromack soils have cambic horizons.   Fairburn soils have a loamy particle-size control section. Kyle soils have bedrock at depths greater than 40 inches.  Nunn soils have a fine textured argillic horizon.  Satanta soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section.  Swanboy soils have visible salts within 10 inches of the surface.  Kyle and Pierre soils are on smoother parts of nearby landscapes.  Nunn and Satanta soils are on flats above the Samsil soils.  Swanboy soils are on toeslopes and flats below the Samsil soils."
