  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The moisture control section is usually dry in all parts for 70 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. The particle size control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments and 18 to 30 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches.  Mollic colors continue below 20 inches but are the result of the color of the rock (lithochromic).  Organic matter also declines below 1 percent below 20 inches.  Soil reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam with 10 to 20 percent clay.  The subsurface layers are sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or loam with 15 to 25 percent clay.  It has 5 to 15 percent cobbles, 10 to 20 percent coarse gravel, and 5 to 15 percent fine gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent cobbles, 20 to 30 percent coarse gravel, and 15 to 25 percent fine gravel."

Elevations are 3,000 to 4,600 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 120 days."

Ateron soils are found on basalt benches and plateaus above serpentine exposures, frigid, clayey-skeletal, and are shallow bedrock.  Belshaw soils are on adjacent south slopes, very deep over weathered tuffs, and are in the fine family.  Finsel soils are on north slopes, frigid, and are clayey-skeletal.  Grell soils are found on sideslopes in complex with Stussi and are shallow to serpentine bedrock.  Tub soils are on north slopes, very deep to weathered tuffs, and are in the fine family.  Waterbury soils are found on sideslopes of basalt flows located above serpentine exposures, are shallow to bedrock, and are clayey-skeletal."
