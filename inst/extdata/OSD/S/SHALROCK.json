  "OVERVIEW": "The Shalrock series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sedimentary rock with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  These soils are on backslopes, shoulders and ridges of mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick.  Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The upper 7 to 20 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.00 to 1.20 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section has 40 to 65 percent percent rock fragments, 25 to 50 percent medium and coarse sand, and 5 to 15 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has values of 3 or 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist.\nThe Bw horizon has values of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist. and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly ashy sandy loam or very cobbly ashy sandy loam.  It has 25 to 30 percent gravel, 5 to 15 percent cobbles, and 0 to 3 percent stones.  Soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has values of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist.  It is very cobbly sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam.  It has 20 to 35 percent gravel, 15 to 30 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.  Soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral."

Bearspring, Cassal, Scoap, Shilling and Yellcreek soils are very deep.  Cherrycreek and Longs soils are deep to a lithic contact.  Eastpine and Peahke soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days.  Peahke soils have 18 to 30 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Midpeak soils formed over breccia and typically have hue of 7.5YR but range from 5YR to 10YR.  Mineral soils formed over granitic rock and have over 50 percent medium and coarse sand in the particle-size control section."

These soils formed in sedimentary rock consisting of interbedded sandstone and hard shale with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 24 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 22 to 26 degrees F.; the average July temperature ranges from 62 to 67 degrees F.; and the average annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
