  "OVERVIEW": "The Skellog series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium, alluvium, and till derived from granitic and metasedimentary rocks. The Skellog soils are on mountain slopes and drainageways of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 5 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1020 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
