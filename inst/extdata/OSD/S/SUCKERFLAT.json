These soils formed in volcanic ash over slope alluvium and colluvium derived mainly from basalt and tuff-breccia.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,610 meters.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C,and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 33 cm (A and Bw horizons).\nBuried horizon - The zone from 33 to 43 cm (2Bwb horizon).\nVitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 43 cm (A, Bw, and 2Bwb horizons).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 43 cm to underlying hard bedrock (3R layer).\nParticle-size control section and ashy substitute class with glassy mineralogy - The zone from 25 to 43 cm (2Bwb horizon and part of the Bw horizon).\nThe series type location was reexamined and sampled for volcanic glass counts in October 2000.  The particle-size class changed from loamy to ashy and the mineralogy class changed from mixed to glassy as a result of this effort.\nClassification was updated to 11th edition on 07/2011 changed from Lithic Haploxerolls to Aridic Lithic Haploxerolls.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Volcanic glass content determined locally by optical grain count with a polarizing petrographic microscope.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
