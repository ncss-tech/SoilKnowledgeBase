  "OVERVIEW": "The Suckerflat series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over slope alluvium and colluvium derived mainly from basalt and tuff-breccia.  Suckerflat soils are on lava plains, lava plateaus and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is 7 degrees C.",

The particle-size class changed from loamy to ashy and the mineralogy class changed from mixed to glassy as a result of this effort.\nClassification was updated to 11th edition on 07/2011 changed from Lithic Haploxerolls to Aridic Lithic Haploxerolls."
