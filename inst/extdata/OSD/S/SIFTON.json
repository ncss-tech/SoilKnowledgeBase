    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum and depth to contrasting materials range from l4 to 28 inches.  The umbric epipedon is l4 to 24 inches thick.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days following  summer solstice.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 55 degrees F.   The control section contains l5 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the  upper part and 50 to 75 percent coarse fragments in the lower part.  The  soils have l0YR or 7.5YR hue.\nThe Al horizon has value of 2 moist and 2 or 3 dry, and chroma of l or 2.  Below l0 inches it is gravelly silt loam or gravelly loam. This horizon has weak granular or subangular blocky structure.  It is very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is very gravelly loamy coarse sand, very gravelly coarse sand, very gravelly sand, extremely gravelly sand or extremely gravelly coarse sand.  This horizon is very strongly acid to slightly acid.  Some pedons, with solums approaching 28 inches thick, contain a B horizon.  The B horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam or sandy loam and is gravelly."
