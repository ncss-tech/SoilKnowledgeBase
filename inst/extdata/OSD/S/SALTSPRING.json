  "OVERVIEW": "The Saltspring series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fine-loamy alluvium. These nearly level soils are on basin floors and alluvial flats. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 67 degrees F.",
