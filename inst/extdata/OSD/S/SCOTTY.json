  "OVERVIEW": "The Scotty series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively to well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from conglomerate.  These soils are on hillslopes, fan remnants and strath terraces. Slopes are 1 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.",
