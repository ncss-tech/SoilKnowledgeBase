  "OVERVIEW": "The Shabliss series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a thin loess mantle high in volcanic ash.  Shabliss soils are on fan aprons, partial ballenas, and fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
