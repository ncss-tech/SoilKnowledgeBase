Rouette soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October.  Scalade soils contain free carbonates above the duripan.  Trio soils have lithic contacts at depths of 50 to 100 cm.  Truvar soils have mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 15 degrees C.  Unius soils contain 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a thin loess mantle high in volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 825 to 2,260 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
