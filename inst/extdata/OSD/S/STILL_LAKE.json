Great Bend soils are varved with thin layers of sand to clay at a depth of 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches). Varves range from less than 1 mm to 10 mm in thickness. Kings Lake and Kranzburg soils have glacial till between depths of 51 and 102 centimeters (20 and 40 inches). The Kings Lake and Poinsett soils also have strata in the horizon above the glacial till. Strata ranges in texture from loam to silty clay loam and are 10 mm to 50 mm in thickness. Putney soils have gypsum and other salts within depths of 51 centimeters (20 inches)."

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C (38 to 45 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 485 to 735 millimeters (19 to 29 inches). Growing season is about 120 to 160 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 330 to 457 millimeters (13 to 18 inches); and growing degree days are about 2500 to 3000."

Occasional saturation occurs within 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60) inches during the months April through June in years of above normal precipitation. In years with normal precipitation, saturation typically does not occur for periods of 1 month or more within 152 centimeters (60 inches)."
