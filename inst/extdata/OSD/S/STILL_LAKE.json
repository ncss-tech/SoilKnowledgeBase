  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Brandt, Great Bend, Kings Lake, Kranzburg, Poinsett, and Putney series. Brandt soils have a 2C horizon with more than 15 percent gravel. Great Bend soils are varved with thin layers of sand to clay at a depth of 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches). Varves range from less than 1 mm to 10 mm in thickness. Kings Lake and Kranzburg soils have glacial till between depths of 51 and 102 centimeters (20 and 40 inches). The Kings Lake and Poinsett soils also have strata in the horizon above the glacial till. Strata ranges in texture from loam to silty clay loam and are 10 mm to 50 mm in thickness. Putney soils have gypsum and other salts within depths of 51 centimeters (20 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Still Lake soils are nearly level to gently sloping on uplands having plane to convex slopes with gradients of 0 to 6 percent. The soils are formed in calcareous loess deposits overlying loamy glacial till. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C (38 to 45 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 485 to 735 millimeters (19 to 29 inches). Growing season is about 120 to 160 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 330 to 457 millimeters (13 to 18 inches); and growing degree days are about 2500 to 3000."

The somewhat poorly drained Badger soils have a fine textured control section and are in the deeper swales. The moderately well drained Graceland soils have mollic epipedons more than 41 centimeters (16 inches) thick and are on footslopes and in swales. The well drained Kranzburg soils have glacial till between 51 and 102 centimeters (20 and 40 inches) and are on similar landscape positions as the Still Lake soils."

Saturarted hydraulic conductivity, measured in cm per hour, is 1.52 to 5.10 (.6 to 2.0 inches) in the upper loess mantle and .51 to 1.52 (.2 to .6 inches) in the underlying glacial till.  Occasional saturation occurs within 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60) inches during the months April through June in years of above normal precipitation. In years with normal precipitation, saturation typically does not occur for periods of 1 month or more within 152 centimeters (60 inches)."
