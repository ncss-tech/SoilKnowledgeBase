These soils are essentially barren of vegetation but have a thin benthic, blue-green algal mat consisting of Cyanobacteria. Halophytic vegetation consisting of saltwort and glasswort occur for short periods after inundation. The surface salinity rises as the surface dries, and eventually becomes toxic to the plants.\nEcological sites assigned to phases and components of this series are listed below.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series type location was moved from Willacy County to Kenedy County during the Soil Survey of Kenedy County because of easier access, local laboratory data, and more centralized series concept. The classification was changed from Typic Salorthids to Typic Aquisalids in 1995 based on application of the 6th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. The classification was changed in December 2004 from Typic Aquisalids to Sodic Psammaquents based on application of the 9th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy and field investigations during the mapping of Padre Island National Seashore.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 in). (Anz1, Anz2, Cnzg1, and Cnzg2 horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 43 cm (0 to 17 in). (Anz1 and Anz2 horizons)\nSalic Horizons: The zone from 43 to 203 cm (17 to 80 in). (Horizons Cnzg1, Cnzg2, and Cnzg3)\nEndosaturation: The zone of saturation at 31 to 203 cm (12 to 80 in). (Anz2, Cnzg1, Cnzg2, and Cnzg3 horizons)\nAquic conditions: These soils remain saturated and have reducing conditions for at least one month in most years from 31 to 203 cm (12 to 80 in).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data exists on the typical pedon from Kenedy County. Particle-size analysis on five pedons, and salinity and sodicity tests on eight pedons performed at the soil survey project office. Salic horizons based on local lab data from pedon L17-102-1.\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
