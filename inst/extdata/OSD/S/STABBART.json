  "OVERVIEW": "The Stabbart series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium.  These soils are on toe slopes and alluvial fans at elevations of 800 to 1,200 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 95 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
