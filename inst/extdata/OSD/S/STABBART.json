These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from fine textured igneous rock.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters  The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 100 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 115 to 135 days."
