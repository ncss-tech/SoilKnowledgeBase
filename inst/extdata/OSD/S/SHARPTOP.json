    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Sharptop soils are on convex southeast to northwest-facing back slopes, shoulders and summits of dissected hills and hills on basalt plateaus. Slopes range from 5 to 25 percent. They formed in loess with an influence of loess and volcanic ash in the surface over colluvium and residuum weathered from basalt or metasedimentary bedrock, predominantly siltite and fine grained quartzite. Elevation ranges from 2,700 to 3,300 feet. The average annual air temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 28 to 32 inches. The frost free period is 90 to 120 days."
