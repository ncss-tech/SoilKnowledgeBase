Chlorite, talc and serpentine-subgroup clays (e.g. chrysotile, antigorite, lizardite) are strongly represented in the clay fractions. Sand fractions have substantial amounts of serpentine or mafic minerals (pyroxene, hornblende, and iron oxides) that are associated with the serpentinization process.
