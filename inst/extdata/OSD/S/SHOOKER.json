  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free secondary carbonates ranges from 24 to 48 inches.  Rock fragments of mixed lithology comprise about 2 to 8 percent of the volume in all horizons.\nSome pedons have an O horizon as much as 2 inches thick consisting mainly of forest litter, principally leaves, twigs, and fine roots.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Ap horizon or A horizon, when mixed to 7 inches, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or more moist, and chrojma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  It is moderatley acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, commonly with higher chroma mottling.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  It is moderately acid to neutral.  In many pedons the E horizon extends as interfingers into the B horizon.\nThe B horizon typically has hue of 2.5Y, but in some pedons the upper part is 10YR and in some pedons the lower part is 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It averages 18 to 35 percent clay and 35 to 55 percent sand.  It commonly is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam, but subhorizons with textures of sandy loam or fine sandy loam are within the range.  It has clay films that have value or chroma or both that is 1 or 2 units lower than that of the matrix.  It typically is moderately acid to neutral in the upper part and slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part, but some pedons have subhorizons in the upper part that are strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam. It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  It has calcium carbonate equivalent of 5 to 30 percent, commonly greater than 20 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shooker soils have plane to slightly concave slopes on glacial till plains.  Slope gradients are 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in calcareous loam or sandy loam glacial till of Late Wisconsinan Age.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 28 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 120.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 1000 to 1500 feet."
