  "OVERVIEW": "The Shakan series consists of moderately deep, moderately well to well drained soils formed in colluvium on footslopes and backslopes of valley sides.  Slopes range from 35 to 150 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 120 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 60 percent and is dominantly gravel.  Reaction ranges from very strongly to medium acid.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature is about 46 degrees F.\nThe A horizons have hue from 2.5YR through 10YR; value and chroma moist from 1 through 3.  Texture is sandy loam, silt loam, or loam. Coarse fragment content increases with depth and ranges from 5 to 60 percent gravel.\nThe C horizon has a hue from 2.5YR through 10YR;  value moist from 2 through 4; and chroma moist from 1 through 4.  Texture is sandy loam, loam or silt loam with more than 35 percent coarse fragments."

The climate is humid maritime with mean annual precipitation of 120 to 220 inches, much of this which occurs as snow.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F.  Slopes range from 35 to 150 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1000 to 2000 feet."

Hydaburg and Sunnyhay soils are shallow organic alpine soils on ridges and shoulder slopes of mountainsides.  The McGilvery are well drained organic soils directly underlain by bedrock on shoulders of mountainsides.  The St. Nicholas and Tolstoi soils are shallow to bedrock, have spodic horizons, and occur on backslopes of mountainsides."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this profile include:  an umbric epipedon from 0 to 17 inches based on color and an assumed base saturation of less than 50 percent;  the lack of a diagnostic subsoil horizon;  loamy-skeletal particle size from 10 to 25 inches; and a cryic temperature regime.  The Shakan series formerly classified as thixotropic-skeletal, Humic Cryorthods.  The soils, as mapped throughout Southeast Alaska, has no morphological evidence of spodic development.  The exchange complex is not dominated by amorphous material."
