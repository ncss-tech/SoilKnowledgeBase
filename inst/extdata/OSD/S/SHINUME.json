These soils formed in colluvium derived from limestone and sandstone over residuum weathered from limestone and sandstone. The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches (152 to 254 millimeters) and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January. The mean annual air temperature is 54 to 57 degrees Fahrenheit (12.0 to 14.0 degrees Celsius).  The frost-free period is 150 to 180 days."
