  "REVDATE": "11/2013",
  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Shinume series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum from sandstone and limestone.  Shinume soils are on shoulders of structural benches.  Slopes range from 4 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches (203 millimeters) and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F. (12.8 degrees C.)",
