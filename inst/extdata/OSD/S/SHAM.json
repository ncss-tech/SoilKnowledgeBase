  "OVERVIEW": "The Sham series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in stratified alluvium.  These soils are on fans, floodplains and terraces and have slopes ranging from 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 13 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The particle-size control section averages loam, silt loam or very fine sandy loam with 10 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser sand.  It is stratified with 2 to 10 mm thick lenses but some lenses are as thick as 5 cm.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 moist.  It ranges from slightly to strongly effervescent.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have a thin A1 horizon with a moist chroma of 3.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y.  It has very hard or extremely hard consistence and ranges from slightly to strongly effervescent.  It is strongly alkaline.  In some pedons thin lenses of silty clay loam are at various depths and coarser or finer textures are below depths of 40 inches in other pedons.  The upper part of the C horizon is usually massive, but some pedons have weak or moderate grades of coarse or very coarse prismatic or blocky structure.  The prisms or blocks break into plates along strata lines."
