  "OVERVIEW": "The Sanpedro series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed from loamy slope alluvium over residuum derived from basalt. Sanpedro soils are on basalt mesas and scarps.  Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
