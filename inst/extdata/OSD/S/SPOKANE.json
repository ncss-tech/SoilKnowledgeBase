  "OVERVIEW": "The Spokane series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granite, gneiss and schist mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Spokane soils are on hills, mountains and ridgetops. Slopes are of 3 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 550 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.9 degrees C.",
