The upper part of the particle-size control section has 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sandy or coarser material.  The lower part is sand or gravelly sand.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 2 through 4 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 1, 2, or 3 moist and dry.  It is mottled in some pedons.\nThe C1 horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 2 through 6 moist, 4 through 8 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry and has fine or medium distinct or prominent redox concentrations.  Some part between 10 and 30 inches has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and chroma of 2.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 8 dry, and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and dry.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, sand, gravelly sand, or coarse sand."

Sumas soils are in a marine climate with cool winters and warm, dry summers.  Snow cover is intermittent.  The average annual rainfall, which falls mostly between October and May, ranges from 35 to 60 inches.  Each of the summer months generally has 1 inch of rain.  Mean January temperature is 38 degrees F, mean July temperature is 64 degrees F.  The average annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F, and the frost-free season is 150 to 210 days."

Briscot soils are coarse-loamy.  Mukilteo soils are deep organic soils.  Nooksack soils have a mollic epipedon.  Oridia soils are coarse-silty.  Puyallup soils have a mollic epipedon, a xeric moisture regime, and are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Shalcar soils are organic over mineral.  Snohomish soils are mineral over organic.  Sultan soils have a xeric moisture regime and lack contrasting sandy textures in the particle-size control section."
