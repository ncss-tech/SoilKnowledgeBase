These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 12 to 36 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days.  The 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.45 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of more than 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of more than 2.0 percent and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry, 2 through 4 moist.  Pumice fragments range from 35 to 60 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6 dry, 3 through 6 moist.  It is very paragravelly ashy coarse sandy loam, very paragravelly ashy sandy loam, and extremely paragravelly ashy sandy loam.  Pumice fragments range from 50 to 70 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry.  A stratified lense of loamy sand to sandy loam volcanic ash may be present in some profiles.  Pumice fragments range from 75 to 90 percent."

In addition Lapine soils have loamy coarse sand and coarse sand fine-earth textures, and Maklak soils have similar fine-earth textures and contain a significant amount of paracobbles.  Wedge soils are similar and need review for series separation."

Shadypass soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice.  They are in climate of warm, dry summers and cold, moist winter.  The average January temperature is about 22 degrees F., the average July temperature is about 60 degrees F., and the average annual temperature is 37 to 40 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 35 to 45 inches.  The growing season at 28 degrees F. is about 100 to 130 days."
