(Aby and Cy1 horizons)\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 22 inches.  (Ay1, Ay2 and Aby horizons)\nEndosaturation:  The presence of irrigation induced saturation at 18 to 42 inches during the months of April through December.\nRedoximorphic features:  The presence of redox concentrations and depletions in the zone from 40 to 60 inches.  (Ab, C2, and C3 horizons)\nVertic features:  Shower soils are mapped in the same parent materials as the competing Baldfield series.  Baldfield soils are mapped in adjacent delineations.  The Baldfield soils have cracks within 125 cm of the soil surface that are 5 mm or more wide through a thickness of 30 cm or more some time in most years and have non-intersecting slickensides.  It is assumed that Shower soils would have these same characteristics if they were not irrigated and did not have an irrigation induced water table between 18 and 42 inches.\nTaxonomic version:  Eighth Edition, 1998.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
