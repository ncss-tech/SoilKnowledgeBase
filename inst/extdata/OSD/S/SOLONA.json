  "OVERVIEW": "The Solona series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy glacial till on ground moraines.  These soils have moderate permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of soil development and to carbonates typically ranges from 24 to 30 inches, but the full range is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages between 12 and 18 percent clay. Volume of gravel ranges from 2 to 15 percent in the solum and 2 to 25 percent in the substratum.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 8 percent in the solum and substratum. Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline in the surface layer and subsoil but ranges to moderately alkaline in the lower subsoil in some pedons.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the substratum.  Carbonates are in the substratum and, in some pedons, are in the lower part of the subsoil.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of  5YR, 7.5YR, or  10YR ; value of 2 to 4; and chroma of 1 to 3.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with similar hue, but value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.   Texture of  the Ap or A horizon is loam, silt loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of  5YR, 7.5YR, or  10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is dominantly sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam; but ranges to loamy sand in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of  5YR, 7.5YR, or  10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam, but some pedons have thin subhorizons with more than 20 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR , value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam or the gravelly analogs."
