  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  Sorf soils are usually dry  in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for  more than half of the time that the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F.  The soils are neutral or slightly alkaline in the upper solum and moderately or strongly alkaline in the lower part.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent in the surface horizon and 0 to 35 percent in the argillic horizon.  Depth to paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.  There is an absolute clay increase between the A and 2Bt horizon of 25 to 30 percent.  The depth to secondary carbonates is 10 to 25 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is loam with 20 to 27 percent clay, 10 to 50 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 25 percent stones.\nThe 2Bt and 2Btss horizons have value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6 dry and moist.  It is clay with 45 to 60 percent clay.  It has 0 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles. This horizon ranges from weak to strong prismatic to moderate to strong subangular blocky structure.\nThe 2Bk horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 to 6 dry and moist.  It is clay loam with 27 to 40 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  In some pedons, a 2Btk horizon is present."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sorf soils are on nearly level to steep side slopes at elevations of 1,200 to 2,800 feet.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. These soils formed in mixed loess and colluvium in the upper part and old unconsolidated moderately fine and fine textured tuffaceous sediments in the lower part.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean summer temperature is 63 to 66 degrees F.  The mean winter temperature is 33 to 36 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 49 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free (32 degrees F.) period is 80 to 160 days."

Day and Ridgeway soils have clay content of 60 to 70 percent, lack Bt horizons and have intersecting slickensides.  Lithgow soils are moderately fine textured and have more than 35 percent rock fragments.  Simas soils occur on north slopes and have mollic epipedons."
