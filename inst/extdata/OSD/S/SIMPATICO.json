  "OVERVIEW": "The Simpatico series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from surrounding loess deposits.  These soils are in upland swales on mesa tops and have slopes of 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches and day include all or part of the argillic horizon.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges between 40 to 60 inches.  Rock fragments in the A and Bt horizons range from 0 to 10 percent but are typically less than 5 percent.  Depth to contrasting 2C material ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  The moisture control section is dry for 15 consecutive days from May 15 to July 15 when the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F. (5 degrees C.).  It is not dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice to October 20, and for at least 90 cumulative days during that period.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 3.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is typically silty clay loam or clay loam but clay content ranges from 27 to 35 percent, silt from 35 to 70 percent and sand from 5 to 35 percent with less than 15 percent being fine sand or coarser.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR.  It is very cobbly loam or loam.  Glacial outwash or sand and gravel are at depths between 40 to 60 inches or more in some pedons.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Goshen, Hall, Johnstown, Kuma, and Mobridge soils are moist in some parts of the moisture control section from May 15 to July 15 and are in a climatic setting that receives over 3/4 of their precipitation between April and September.  In addition, Kuma soils have polygenetic profiles and Goshen, Hall and Mobridge soils have hues of 10YR in the Bt horizon.   Also, Johnstown soils have hue of 10YR in the argillic horizon, and have buried horizons below depths of 14 to 35 inches.  Kinsell, Lazarus, and Zepol soils have an aridic moisture regime."

The soils formed in alluvium from nearby loess deposits.  Average annual temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F., and mean summer temperature ranges from 60 to 68 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 18 inches and is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year with about half the precipitation falling between April and September.  May and June are the driest months.  PE Index is about 50 at the type location and ranges from 25 to 60 for the series."
