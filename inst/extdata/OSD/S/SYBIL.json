Volume of rock fragments throughout the series control section averages less than 10 percent.  Most rock fragments are pebble size.  The soil moisture control section is not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days in most years.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.  The dry colors have values less than 5.5  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or sandy loam.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or loamy fine sand.  It is moderately acid to neutral.  In cultivated areas all or parts of the E horizon have been incorporated into the Ap horizon.\nSome pedons have E/B, EB, B/E, or BE horizons.\nThe upper Bt horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or fine sandy loam with occassional subhorizons that are sandy clay loam or loam.  It is composed of either continuous or discontinuous horizons or layers with a composite thickness greater than 3 inches.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe lower Bt horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or sand.  It is either a continuous horizon or has discontinuous layers with clay coatings on the sand grains or bridging between sand grains.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon with colors and textures similar to the lower Bt horizon but lack clay bridging.\nThe C horizon has a hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is sand or coarse sand.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline."
