  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 40 to greater than 80 inches.  Thickness of the loamy mantle ranges from 10 to 24 inches.  Clay content in the clayey till ranges from 35 to 90 percent.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the loamy mantle.  Volume of gravel typically ranges from 1 to 4 percent in the clayey till but some individual pedons or subhorizons of pedons have no gravel.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 2 percent throughout. Carbonates occur within the control section, typically at a depth of 20 to 60 inches but the depth ranges to 80 inches in some pedons. Reaction naturally ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the loamy mantle but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon, where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the upper part of the clayey subsoil.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline in the lower part of the clayey subsoil and in the substratum. Redox features are in the spodic horizon or in the albic horizon above the spodic and within a depth of 20 inches.  Saturation occurs within a depth of 20 inches in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Some pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  The E horizon is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a Bhs horizon as much as 4 inches thick with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Volume of ortstein ranges up to 50 percent in some pedons.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, and value and chroma of 3 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together.  The Bs horizon is sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Volume of ortstein ranges up to 50 percent in some pedons.\nSome pedons have a E' horizon with hue of 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.\nSedgwick soils have a glossic horizon.  Horizonation below the spodic horizon has a wide range depending on the thickness of the loamy mantle and the depth to which spodic development and eluviation have occurred.  Therefore there can be E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons, singly or in combination.\nWhere present, the E part of the E/B or B/E horizons has color and texture like the E' horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe 2E part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizon has color like the E' horizon described above.  It is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam in the upper part of the glossic and is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay in the lower part.  The 2Bt part has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together.  The 2Bt part is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay,\nThe 2Bt horizon and the 2Btk horizon have color and texture like the 2Bt part described above.\nThe 2Btk horizon has color and texture like the 2Bt part described above.\nSome pedons have a 2Bk horizon or a 2C horizon, or both, with color and texture like the 2Bt part described above."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sedgwick soils are on knolls and sideslopes on till plains.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in a thin mantle of loamy alluvium and in the underlying clayey till.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from about 90 to 120 days.  Elevation ranges from 600 to 1200 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Allendale, Badriver, Engadine, Munuscong, and Superior soils.  Allendale soils occupy landscape positions similar to those of Sedgwick soils, where there is a sandy mantle 20 to 40 inches thick.  Badriver soils occupy similar landscape positions where the spodic horizon is absent.  The moderately well drained Superior soils, the somewhat poorly drained Engadine soils, and the poorly drained and very poorly drained Munuscong soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where the soil formed in loamy alluvium and clayey lacustrine deposits."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Runoff is slow to rapid.  Permeability is moderate in the loamy alluvium and extremely slow to slow in the till.  These soils have a perched seasonal water table at a depth of 0.5 to 2.0 feet at some time during the period September to June in most years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for woodland.  Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest.  Common trees are red pine, red maple, balsam fir, quaking aspen, northern red oak and paper birch.  Common understory species are willow, speckled alder, redosier dogwood, bracken fern, bunchberry dogwood, partridgeberry, and sedges.  Some areas are used for cropland.  Oats, bromegrass, timothy, alfalfa, and red clover are the principal crops."
