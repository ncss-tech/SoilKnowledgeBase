  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from about 60 to 90 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 20 to 36 inches.  Soil reaction is medium acid to very strongly acid throughout except where the surface has been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2, or value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The A horizon is less than 6 inches in thickness when color value is 3 or less and have value of 4 or more when the upper 7 inches of the soil is mixed.  The E horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture of the A and E horizons is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe BE horizon, when present, and the Bt horizon have hue of 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Reddish mottles are present in the Bt horizon of some pedons.   The BE, when present, is silt loam or loam.  Texture of the Bt horizon is clay loam, silty clay loam, loam, or silt loam.  Content of sand is more than 25 percent with less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 4 to 8; or has hue of 10YR, value of 4 and chroma of 4.  In some pedons, the lower Bx horizon is mottled with shades of brown, yellow, red, or gray.  Texture of the Bx horizon is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Discontinuous reddish streaks commonly border vertical sides of prisms.  Brittle and firm prisms average 4 to 8 inches in diameter when moist.  Vertical cracks are filled with grayish silt loam and silty clay loam.\nThe BC horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 and chroma of 4 to 8; or value of 6 and chroma of 6 or 8.  Mottles are in shades of gray.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Lax and Leadville soils in the same famimly.  Similar soils are Beauregard, Bowie, Cane, Cart, Debute, Dulac, Erno, Grenada, Leverett, Loring, Olivier, Ora, Providence, Savannah, and Thage series.  Beauregard, Bowie, and Cart soils lack fragipans.  In addition, Cart soils have coarse loamy control sections.  Cane, Erno, Ora, and Savannah soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Lax soils have IIBx2 horizons with 35 to 70 percent chert or quartzite coarse fragments.  Leadville soils have silty clay loam to clay textures below the fragipan and acid shale bedrock below 48 inches.  Debute, Dulac, Grenada, Leverett, Loring, Olivier, Ora, and Providence soils have mixed mineralogy.  Leverett soils also have coarse-silty control sections and Grenada sils have an A' horizon above the fragipan and the clay maxima below the fragipan.  Oliver and Thage soils have 1 or 2 chroma mottles in the upper 10 inches of the B horizon."
