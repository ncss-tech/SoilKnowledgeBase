  "OVERVIEW": "The Solomon series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous clayey alluvium.  These nearly level soils are on flood plains and are subject to occasional flooding. These soils occur in the Central Kansas Sandstone Hills, MLRA 74; Central Loess Plains, MLRA 75 and the Bluestem Hills, MLRA 76. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 76 centimeters (30 inches) at the type location.",

There is no lab data available to support this, but it is assumed that it would meet this criteria due to the amount and type (smectitic) of clay.\nSolomon soils will likely classify as a Vertisol if intersecting slickensides are found to occur.\n07/2003 WAW Changed format to semi-tabular from narrative.\nChanged runoff: from very slow to negligible\nRange in characteristics: Added clay and sand content to control section\nModified format by LRM in 3/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.\n09/2015 DJK Updated opening paragraph to current SSRO5 standards. Added quad and lat/long to type location. Added elevation to typical pedon. Added clay content, sand content, CCE, and redoximorphic features to RIC. Added elevation, precipitation pattern, and FFD to geographic setting. Added flooding, ponding, and saturation statement to drainage and Ksat section. Updated use and vegetation section to include wildlife habitat and wetland vegetation. Edited depths of mollic and cambic in remarks. Added Vertic features. Added statement about being a Vertisol if have slickensides. Added available lab data to additional data.\n07/2020 BKN Updated intro paragraph. Updated Distribution and Extent paragraph to include LRR and MLRA names. Removed South Dakota (SD) from the state list at the top as this soils does not occur in SD at all.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy: Twelfth Edition, 2014\nADDITIONAL DATA: Kansas State University Pedology Laboratory data is available for Pedon IDs 88KS061324 and 89KS061346.\nIn Iowa, the native vegetative cover is an herbaceous wetland community commonly inhabited with Prairie Cordgrasses, Big Bluestems, Switchgrasses, Grays Sedges, Fox Sedges, Tall Tickseeds, and Great St. John Worts. Source: Iowa State Office, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Des Moines, IA.\nIn Nebraska, the native vegetative cover is an herbaceous wetland community commonly inhabited with sedges (Carex emoryi, C. laeviconica, C. pellita, C. vulpinoidea), flat stem spikerush, (Eleocharis compressa), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa Pratensis), prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinate).
