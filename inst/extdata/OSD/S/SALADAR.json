    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The organic portion of the control section has colors in hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 2 or 3, and chromas of 1 or 2.  The value and/or chroma may increase 1 or 2 units when exposed to the air.\nThe surface tier (0 to 10 inches) exclusive of loose surface litter is composed of hemic and sapric materials with unrubbed fiber content that ranges from 20 to 30 percent of the organic volume.  Rubbed fiber content is 10 to 15 percent.  Structure of the surface tier ranges from weak to moderate fine granular.\nThe subsurface tier is dominated by sapric material.  The unrubbed fiber content ranges from 15 to 25 percent of the organic volume and is 10 or less after rubbing.  Fibers are chiefly herbaceous.  Size of fibers are commonly 0.15 to 0.5 mm.\nThin layers of mineral materials may occur at any depth within the profile.  Senses of sulfidic material may occur at depths lower than 60 inches.  Water table is at or near the surface most of the year.  The reaction of the profile ranges from 7.4 to 6.5 (by Lamotte method) and decreases with depth."

These soils have formed in thick deposits of almost completely decomposed herbaceous plant remains.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual rainfall is 80 inches and the mean annual temperature is 78 degrees F."
