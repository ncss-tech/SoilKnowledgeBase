  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The Sawatch soils typically are noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches but depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 24 inches thick.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent in most of the control section.  Depth to the sandy-skeletal IIC horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The upper part of the control section is typically fine gandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam, and clay averages 5 to 18 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the upper part of the control section and are dominantly less than 3 inches in diameter.  The soils above depth of 40 inches range from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value ot 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of neutral through 3.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist and chroma of neutral through 2.  The hue of the IIC horizon ranges from 5Y through 7.5YR."

The soils formed in alluvial parent materials or glacial outwash.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 12 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  Mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 54 degrees F."
