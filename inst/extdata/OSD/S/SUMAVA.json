Sumava soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loamy outwash and the underlying till. The upper material is thought to be a mixture of windblown sand and outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation is177 to 466 meters  (580 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level."
