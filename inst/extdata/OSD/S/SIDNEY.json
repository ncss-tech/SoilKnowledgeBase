  "OVERVIEW": "The Sidney series consists of well drained soils on upland hillslopes.  They formed in loamy, calcareous residuum weathered from weakly cemented fine grain sandstone and are deep over weakly cemented calcareous fine grained sandstone.  Slopes range from 3 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 43 centimeters (17 inches) and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. (51 degrees F.) at the type location.",
