  "OVERVIEW": "The Shipley series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Shipley soils are on beach terraces, inset fans, and fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
