These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess, volcanic ash and pyroclastic materials.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations are 1,770 to 2,200 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 100 days."
