  "OVERVIEW": "The Slusser series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess mixed with volcanic ash over older loess. They are on nonglaciated plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
