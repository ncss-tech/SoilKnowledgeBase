The mollic epipedon has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.35 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, including 10 to 20 percent sand-size pumice, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent, and an apparent field estimated clay content of 5 to 14 percent. The particle-size control section has 9 to 18 percent clay, less than 15 percent particles fine sand or coarser, 5 to 30 percent volcanic glass including 1 to 10 percent sand-size ash, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter. Depth to secondary carbonates is 44 inches or more. When present, depth to duripan is 40 to more than 60 inches.

Renslow soils are on long broad ridges and hills and have less than 30 percent volcanic glass in the upper soil profile above the argillic horizon. Sprauer soils are on uplands and are moderately deep to thick indurated duripan. Toler soils are on uplands and are moderately deep to basalt bedrock."
