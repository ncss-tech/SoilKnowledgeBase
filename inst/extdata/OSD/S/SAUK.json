Below 40 inches rock fragments range from 0 to 50 percent by weighted average.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist or dry.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.

Bullards soils have a difference of 5 to 9 degrees F between mean summer and mean winter temperature and are sandy loam throughout the particle-size control section.  Chuckanut, Sehome, Squalicum, and Sulsavar soils are gravelly in the control section.  Kickerville soils have sandy-skeletal material in the lower control section.  Nati soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Sehome soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact with dense glacial till."
