  "OVERVIEW": "The Schmutz series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from gypsiferous siltstone, sandstone, and shale.  These soils are on alluvial fans and valley floors.  The slopes are 1 to 5 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 12 degrees F.",
