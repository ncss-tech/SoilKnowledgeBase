These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the 4 months following the summer solstice.  Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section has 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume and 8 to 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 2 through 4 moist.  It has a moist bulk density of 0.85 to 1.00 g/cubic centimeter and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron is 1 to 2 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 or 6 dry and 3, 4, or 6 moist.  It is extremely gravelly sandy loam or extremely cobbly sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately or slightly acid."
