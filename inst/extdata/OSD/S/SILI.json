  "OVERVIEW": "The Sili series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium weathered from shale and sandstone.  Sili soils are on valley bottoms, pediments, and alluvial fans, usually below shale hills, with slopes of 1 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.9 degrees C.",
