  "OVERVIEW": "The Swantown series consists of moderately deep to a cemented pan, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in glacial till on till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevation is sea level to 600 feet.  Average annual precipitation is about 26 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist and are not dry in all parts between 8 and 24 inches for as much as 45 consecutive days or in some part for as much as 90 cumulative days.  The particle-size control section is 35 to 60 percent coarse fragments by volume and 5 to 15 percent clay by weight.  Depth to the Bsm horizon ranges from 20 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has weak to moderate granular structure.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist, and is mottled.  It is gravelly loam or gravelly sandy loam and has weak to moderate blocky structure.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2, and it is mottled.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bsm horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2, and it is mottled.  It ranges from gravelly sandy loam to very gravelly sandy loam and is moderately to weakly cemented."

The \"pan\" in similar soils is cemented by iron, aluminum and organic matter and the soils classified as Spodisols.  This soil has a udic moisture regime.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from 3 to 8 inches, a cambic horizon from 8 to 25 inches, and a cemented pan at 25 to 35 inches.\nClassification changed 1/00 from mixed, mesic Vitrandic Durochrepts to isotic, mesic Tyhpic Petraquepts based on revisions to Soil Taxonomy.\nDepth to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the to of the first mineral horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
