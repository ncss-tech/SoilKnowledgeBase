Boomstick soils contain profiles that are 70 to 80 percent channers and flagstone and contain carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Checkett, Hooplite, and Phliss soils have calcareous argillic horizons.  Chubard and Richinde soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July through September due to convection storms. Cottle and Old Camp soils have carbonate coatings on rock fragments in the Bt horizon. Doorkiss soils have an abrupt textural change between the A horizon and Bt horizon. Fortyday soils have soil temperature that range from 9 to 12 degrees C. and contain 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Gabbvally and Thike soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Nevo soils have bedrock that range from 13 to 30 cm and soil temperature range from 10 to 13 degrees C. Olac soils have 60 to 75 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon.  Rowel soils have an abrupt textural change and a Bt horizon with 40 to 55 percent clay.  Stewval soils are 10 to 25 cm deep to bedrock and are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July through September due to convection storms."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Soughe soils are on rock core areas of fan piedmont remnant side slopes and, hills, plateaus and mountain ridges, crests, summits, shoulders and side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from various rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,345 to 2,200 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
