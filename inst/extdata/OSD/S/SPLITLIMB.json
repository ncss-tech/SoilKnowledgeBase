  "REVDATE": "09/2004",
  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Splitlimb series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on uplands.  They formed in loess and silty slope alluvium.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping upland divides and in sinkholes.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",
