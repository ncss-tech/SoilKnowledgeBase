Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches."

Lowassie soils are clayey, poorly drained and are on similar positions. Tonti soils have a fragipan and are on broad ridgetops. Viburnum soils are clayey, moderately well drained and are on similar positions."

In undisturbed areas a perched water table has an upper limit of 1 to 2.5 feet during December to April in most years.  In depressional areas, these soils are subject to ponding."
