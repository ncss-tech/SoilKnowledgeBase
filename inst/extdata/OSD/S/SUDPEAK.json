  "OVERVIEW": "The Sudpeak series consists of very deep, moderately well-drained soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from basalt and other igneous rocks. They are on alluvial and colluvial fan terraces and terraces of small mountain streams. Elevation is 3,800 to 6,600 feet. Vegetation is grass and shrubs. Average annual precipitation is about 23 inches. Average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. Permeability is slow. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.",

In addition, Cucharas soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact, and Gourley and Heathcoat soils have horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation. The Savar soils have horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation. Slights soils are moderately acid in the Bt horizon and lack a water table. Sudduth soils have a lithologic discontinuity. Toponce soils have a solum thickness of 60 inches or more and lack a water table. Wetopa soils lack a water table and redox features above 40 inches."
