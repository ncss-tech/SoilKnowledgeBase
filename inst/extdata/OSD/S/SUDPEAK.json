The Beaverdam, Buckskin, Cimarron, Cucharas, Gourley, Heathcoat, and Youman soils have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick. In addition, Cucharas soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact, and Gourley and Heathcoat soils have horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation. The Savar soils have horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation. Slights soils are moderately acid in the Bt horizon and lack a water table. Sudduth soils have a lithologic discontinuity. Toponce soils have a solum thickness of 60 inches or more and lack a water table. Wetopa soils lack a water table and redox features above 40 inches."
