  "OVERVIEW": "The Sunbury series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess or other silty material and the underlying calcareous loamy till or lacustrine sediments on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches).",

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sunbury soils are typically on convex slopes of slightly dissected, nearly level to gently undulating till plains. In many places, they are in narrow bands between soils bordering the streams and having lighter colored surface layers and soils on the undissected interfluves having thicker dark colored surface layers. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Sunbury soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess or other silty material, and the underlying calcareous loamy till or lacustrine sediments of Wisconsinan age. The mean annual temperature varies from 8 to 12 degrees C. (46 to 54 degrees F), the mean annual precipitation varies from 813 to 1092 mm (32 to 43 inches), frost free period ranges from 160 to 195 days, and elevation ranges from 180 to 250 meters (590 to 820 feet) above mean sea level."

They are on low lying or nearly level parts of the interfluves below the Sunbury soils. Flanagan soils are adjacent on the generally undissected interfluves at similar or slightly higher topographic positions. Sabina soils are adjacent and closer to the drainageways. They are on similar or slightly lower topographic positions."

These soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) below the surface at some time between January and May in most years. The potential for surface runoff is low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the solum and moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow in the underlying material."
