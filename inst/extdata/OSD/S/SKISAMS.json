  "OVERVIEW": "The Skisams series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone, shale, granite, and some basalt.  Skisams soils are on hills, mesas, and structural benches.  Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
