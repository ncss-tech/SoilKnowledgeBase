  "OVERVIEW": "The Skime series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in stratified sandy and silty glaciolacustrine sediments on glacial lake plains. They have moderately rapid or rapid permeability. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches.",

Rock fragments are typically lacking in the series control section.\nThe A or Ap horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5 moist or 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist or dry. It is loamy fine sand, fine sand or loamy sand. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand or fine sand. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loamy fine sand. It averages 10 to 18 percent clay. In places lamellae occur as bands 1/4 to 2 inches thick. Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon with colors and textures similar to the C horizon.\nThe C horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, very fine sand, fine sand or sand. In some pedons the C horizon is stratified with these textures. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a 2C horizon with a hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2.
