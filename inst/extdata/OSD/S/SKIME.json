Rock fragments are typically lacking in the series control section.\nThe A or Ap horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5 moist or 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist or dry. It is loamy fine sand, fine sand or loamy sand. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand or fine sand. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loamy fine sand. It averages 10 to 18 percent clay. In places lamellae occur as bands 1/4 to 2 inches thick. Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon with colors and textures similar to the C horizon.\nThe C horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, very fine sand, fine sand or sand. In some pedons the C horizon is stratified with these textures. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a 2C horizon with a hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2.

The mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F. Elevation ranges from 785 to 1350 feet. The frost-free period is 90 to 140 days."

The poorly drained Augsburg, Borup and Zippel soils are on lower lying broad flats and in swales and have a mollic epipedon. Glyndon soils have a calcic horizon within 16 inches of the surface, are silty throughout the profile and have a mollic epipedon. Hiwood and Redby soils are in similar positions but are sandy throughout the profile."
