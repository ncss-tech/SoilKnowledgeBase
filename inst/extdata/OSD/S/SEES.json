Limestone fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the solum, and 0 to 35 percent in the C horizons.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have free lime in the solum or in the C horizon.\nThe A and Ap horizons have hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 3, and chroma of 3 or less. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Redoximorphic features range from few to many in shades of brown and gray. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, and clay.\nThe Bt2 horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Redoximorphic features range from common to many in shades of brown and gray. Texture is silty clay or clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Many pedons are a mottled pattern in shades of olive, gray, and brown without a dominant matrix color.  Texture is silty clay or clay."
