  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to limestone, siltstone, or shale bedrock is 40 to more than 100 inches.  Thickness of the solum is 30 to 60 inches.  Limestone fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the solum, and 0 to 35 percent in the C horizons.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have free lime in the solum or in the C horizon.\nThe A and Ap horizons have hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 3, and chroma of 3 or less. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Redoximorphic features range from few to many in shades of brown and gray. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, and clay.\nThe Bt2 horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Redoximorphic features range from common to many in shades of brown and gray. Texture is silty clay or clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Many pedons are a mottled pattern in shades of olive, gray, and brown without a dominant matrix color.  Texture is silty clay or clay."

Manawa soils have 2B horizons that have hues of 5YR or 2.5R.  Ashton soils have a fine-silty textural control section and lack gray mottles in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  Brooke soils lack grayish mottles in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon and have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Licking soils lack the 6 to 10 inch dark colored A horizon.  Woolper soils have a mollic epipedon."
