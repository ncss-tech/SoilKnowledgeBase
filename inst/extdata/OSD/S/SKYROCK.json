The soil moisture  control section is dry in all parts from about mid July to mid October (75 to 85 days).  The soil temperature at a depth of 18 inches exceeds 41 degrees F from about mid May to mid November (180 days), and exceeds 47 degrees F from about mid June to mid October.  The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 6/4, 6/3, or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/4, 3/3, or 4/4.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon moist color is 10YR 4/4, 3/4, or 4/6.  It is very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly loam, or extremely gravelly sandy clay loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid."
