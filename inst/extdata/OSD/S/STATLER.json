  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum ranges from about 30 to 80 inches.  The soil is moderately acid or strongly acid in each horizon except the surface layer is less acid where limed.  Limed soils tipically range from slightly acid to neutral in the upper part.  Very fine to medium size flakes of mica in each horizon range from few or none to common.  The amount of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to about 15 percent by volume in the A and B horizons and from 0 to about 30 percent in the C horizon.  Transitional horizons have colors and textures similar to adjacent horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 to 4 . It is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  In some pedons, the lower part of the Bt horizon is mottled with shades of brown, yellow, and gray.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or silt loam.  In some pedons, there are thin subhorizons of fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has the range of colors and texture given for the Bt horizon.  In many pedons it is mottled in shades of brown, yellow, and gray."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Royce, Saunook, and Trimont series.  Royce soils are dominantly 2.5YR.  Saunook soils have up to 35 percent rock fragments in the A and B horizons and up to 60 percent in the C horizon.  Trimont soils have up to 35 percent rock fragments and have C horizons of Saprolite."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Statler soils are on level to sloping low terraces along streams in or flowing out of the Unaka Mountain range.  Slope gradients most commonly are 0 to 5 percent but range up to 15 percent on the narrow slopes between the low terraces and first bottoms.  These soils are formed in loamy alluvium washed from watersheds dominated by granite, gneiss, graywacke, phyllite, and arkosic sandstone.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 52 degrees F. to 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 45 to 55 inches.\nGEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS;  These are the competing Sawnook series and the Chagrin, Codorus, Colvard, Comus, Dillsboro, Hemphill, Lobdell, Rosman and Transylvania series in closely related famlies.  Chagrin, Codorus, Colvard, Comus, Lobdell, Rosman and Transylvania are on the first bottoms and lack argillic horizons.  Dillsboro soils are clayey and on terraces.  Hemphill soils are poorly drained and on terraces.  Saunook soils are on fans, benches, and foot slopes."
