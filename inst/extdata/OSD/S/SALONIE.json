  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of recent volcanic ash ranges from 9 to 24 inches.  Texture of the uppermost layers ranges from silt loam to loamy fine sand.  In places, a thin recent deposit of alluvial silt overlies the ash.  The buried layer of silty alluvium ranges in thickness from 4 to 15 inches, but is usually 6 to 10 inches thick.  It may contain thin sandy or fine gravelly seams."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Kalsin and Olds series in the same family.  Kalsin soils have buried alluvial layers greater than 15 inches thick.  Olds soils have buried O horizons and more than 18 percent clay in the upper control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Salonie soils are on higher portions of floodplains along actively cutting streams.  They are formed in volcanic ash overlying alluvium from metamorphic rock and dark colored ashy soils on adjacent uplands.  The climate is cool maritime.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 70 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.  Temperatures below freezing are recorded on fewer than 40 days annually, and temperatures above 70 degrees F. are rare."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Kizhuyak, Kodiak, and Sharatin series.  Kizhuyak soils consist of thick alluvial accumulations of volcanic ash.  Kodiak soils have, under the recent volcanic ash deposit, dark reddish brown A horizons formed in older volcanic ash over glacial till.  Sharatin soils are like the Kodiak soils except that the buried solum overlies glacial outwash gravel rather than glacial till."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Altered drainage is present in some pedons due to stream incisement.  Moderate over very rapid permeability.  Runoff is slow to medium.  Some areas are subject to occasional flooding."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Used principally as grazing land.  Native grasses are cut in places for hay and silage, and there are a few gardens and seeded hay fields.  The native vegetation is tall grass, dominated by bluejoint reedgrass, and associated plants such as fireweed.  In places, the soil supportsd stands of cottonwood and willows."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The concept of the Salonie series is poorly defined.  More data is needed to define the central concept or the series should be inactivated (jpm, 4/87).\nSource of the volcanic ash is the 1912 eruption of Mt. Novarupta and Mt.  Katmai on the Alaska Peninsula.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
