The  mean annual soil temperature is 54 to 58 degrees F. and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F. or is not below 47 degrees F. after mid-February.  The soil between depths of about 8 and 25 inches usually is dry all of the time from June until October, and usually is moist in all parts all the rest of the year.  Rock fragments make up on the average 35 to 65 percent of the volume of soil below 10 inches.  Textures throughout are coarse sandy loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam and the soil is medium acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon is dark gray, gray, grayish brown, dark grayish brown, very dark grayish brown and brown (10YR 5/1, 4/1, 4/2, 3/2, 5/3).  It has 3 to 8 percent organic matter in the upper part, decreasing regularly to less than 1 percent between the depths of 10 and 20 inches.  Base saturation is 75 to 90 percent.\nThe C horizon is brown, light brown, pale brown or light yellowish brown.  In some pedons, the C horizon is massive and in some it has subangular blocky or granular structure."

La Posta soils have a sand or loamy sand control section. Lopez and Plaskett soils are less than 20 inches deep to a lithic contact.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Surface rock outcrops, boulders; stones and cobblestones in variable proportions, cover 1 to 25 percent of the surface and there is some gravitational downslope movement of soil.  The soils formed in residuum weathered from schist, sandstone, shale, gneiss, and acid igneous rocks.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters with some snow on ridge tops and on north exposures.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 80 inches.  The average January temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 64 to 66 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 53 to 57 degrees F.  The frost free season is 150 to 250 days."
