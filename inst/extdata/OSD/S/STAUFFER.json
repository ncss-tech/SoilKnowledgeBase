  "OVERVIEW": "The Stauffer series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian materials and lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic ash. Stauffer soils are on lakebeds. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
