  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches. Depth to the fragipan is 20 to 40 inches below the surface. Yellowish brown and black concretions range from 0 to 10 percent by volume throughout the solum and they are 2 mm to 10 mm in diameter.  Red concretions range from 0 to 10 percent by volume in the Bt2 and Btx horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 5.  It is fine sandy loam or loam.  Fragments of sandstone less than 76 mm in diameter make up 0 to 15 percent by volume.  Reaction is slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is fine sandy loam or loam.  Fragments of sandstone less than 76 mm in diameter make up 0 to l5 percent by volume.  Reaction is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nIn some pedons there is a BA horizon that has colors and textures similar to the Bt horizon.  Reaction is slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles are in shades of yellow, red, brown, and gray.  The Bt horizon is fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  Fragments of sandstone less than 76 mm in diameter make up 0 to 15 percent by volume.  Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, chroma of 4 to 8, with few to many mottles in shades of red, yellow, brown, and gray.  Most pedons are coarsely mottled in shades of yellow, red, brown, and gray.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Average clay content of the horizon is 18 to 35 percent in the upper part but ranges to 38 percent in the lower part.  The gray vertical streaks in seams between polygons range from 1 to 20 mm wide and are usually more clayey than the matrix.  Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nIn some pedons there is a BC horizon that is coarsely mottled in hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 8.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shermore soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping footslopes, benches, and fans below adjacent steeper uplands.  These soils are in valleys of the Ouachita Mountains and the Arkansas Valley and Ridges.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent but are mainly 1 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in loamy colluvium.  The colluvium is from interbedded shales and sandstones of Pennsylvanian age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 56 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 59 degrees to 64 degrees  F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices are greater than 64."

All of these soils lack a fragipan.  Bengal, Carnasaw, Clebit, Enders, Endsaw, Hector, Linker, and Pirum soils are on higher ridges. Bengal, Carnasaw, Enders, and Endsaw soils have a clayey control section.  Clebit and Hector soils have a solum less than 20 inches thick to sandstone bedrock.  Linker and Pirum soils have a solum less than 60 inches thick to sandstone bedrock.  Stigler and Wing soils occur in valleys adjacent to and down slope from the Shermore series and have a fine control section.  In addition, Wing soils are high in sodium.  Sherwood and Zafra soils occur on similar landscapes.  Sherwood soils have a solum less than 60 inches thick to sandstone bedrock. Zafra soils have loamy-skeletal control section."
