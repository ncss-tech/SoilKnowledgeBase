  "OVERVIEW": "The Stinger series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in colluvium weathered from granitic rocks. Stinger soils are on mountain sideslopes.  Slopes are 60 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The particle-size control section has 12 to 18 percent clay and 45 percent or more sand that is coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 5 percent gravel.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry. It is sandy loam or loam with 12 to 18 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.  It is strongly acid to moderately acid.  Base saturation by sum is 30 to 60 percent."
