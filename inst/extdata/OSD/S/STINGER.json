The particle-size control section has 12 to 18 percent clay and 45 percent or more sand that is coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 5 percent gravel.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry. It is sandy loam or loam with 12 to 18 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.  It is strongly acid to moderately acid.  Base saturation by sum is 30 to 60 percent."
