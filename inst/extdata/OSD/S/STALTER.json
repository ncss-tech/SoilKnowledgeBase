  "OVERVIEW": "The Stalter series consists of moderately deep, well-drained soils on backslopes, shoulders and  summits of mountains.  Stalter soils formed in volcanic ash over colluvium and residuum from granite. Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
