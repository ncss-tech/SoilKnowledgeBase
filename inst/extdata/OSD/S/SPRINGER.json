  "OVERVIEW": "The Springer series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian sediments and alluvium. These nearly level to hummocky soils are on interdunes and dunes of sand sheets on stream terraces alluvial plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in).",
