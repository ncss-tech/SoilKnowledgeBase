The B and C horizon is slightly acid to very strongly acid.  Coarse fragments larger than 3 inches in diameter are not present in the pedon.  Coarse fragments smaller than 3 inches are less than 2 percent by volume.\nThe Ap or A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.

In a few places there are the moderately well drained phases of the Meridian soils.  In some nearby areas are the Dakota soils that occupy similar landscapea as the Meridian soils.  Dakota soils do not have mottles and have darker or thicker surface horizons."
