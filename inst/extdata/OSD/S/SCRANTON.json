    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Content of silt plus clay ranges from 5 to 20 percent in the particle size control section.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid in the A horizon and from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout the rest of the profile.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  Where the value is 3 or less, it is a thickness of at least 8 inches.  Many pedons exhibit streaking and stripping.  Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand.\nThe upper part of the Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2, or it is neutral with value of 4 or 5.  The lower part of the C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 0 to 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, and gray range from few to many.  Some pedons have dominant chroma of greater than 2 in the upper part of the C horizon because of the color of the sand grains.  Texture is loamy sand, fine sand, or sand."

The excessively drained Cainhoy and Lakeland soils are on higher adjacent positions.  The somewhat poorly drained Chipley soils are on slightly higher positions.  The moderately well drained Goldsboro soils are on slightly higher positions and have fine-loamy subsoils.  Leon soils are on similar positions and have a Spodic horizon.  The somewhat poorly drained Lynchburg and Ocilla soils are on slightly higher positions.  In addition, Lynchburg soils have fine-loamy subsoils and Ocilla soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness.  Osier soils are on similar positions but do not have dark surface layers.  Pelham and Plummer soils are on similar positions.  In addition, Pelham soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness while Plummer soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches in thickness.  The very poorly drained Rutlege soils are on similar to slightly lower positions and have Umbric epipedons."

The natural vegetation is dominated by longleaf pine, slash pine, sweetgum, and wax myrtle."
