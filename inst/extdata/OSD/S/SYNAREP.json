  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Synarep soil consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with calcareous alluvium. The soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.",
