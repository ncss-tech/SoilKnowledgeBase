  "OVERVIEW": "The Shields series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in a mantle of clayey glacial till or flow till and underlying loamy glacial till on moraines. They have slow permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates typically is 36 to 42 inches but ranges from 28 to 60 inches.  Gravel of mixed lithology and commonly dominated by shale typically comprise 2 to 8 percent of the volume, but in a few pedons the upper part either lacks gravel or has less than 2 percent.  Shale is the major component in the sand fraction.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon, where present, typically has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Fe concentrations are in some E horizons.  The A and E horizons typically are silt loam or silty clay loam, but can be loam or clay loam.  They are moderately or slightly acid.\nThe B/E horizon has color, textures and reaction similar to the E and Btg horizons.\nThe Btg horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have hue of 10YR in the upper part of the Btg horizon.  The Btg horizon typically is silty clay or clay, but in some pedons is silty clay loam or clay loam.  The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon typically averages between 42 and 55 percent clay with an extreme range of 40 to 60 percent and from 15 to 30 percent fine sand and coarser.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bk or 2Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It commonly has Fe concentrations and depletions.  Typically it is a firm, silty clay loam, clay loam, or clay, and less commonly a friable loam or clay loam.\nSome pedons have a C horizon."

The Bluford, Bucknell, Gifford, Kniffin, Pershing, Rathbun, Stateline and Weir soils have free carbonates below a depth of 60 inches.  The Hurst, Kernan and Kilwinning soils have less than 15 percent sand in the lower third of the series control section.  Leonard, Rinda and Sexton soils lack rock fragments in the lower third of the series control section.  McGirk soils average less than 5 percent sand in the particle size control section.  Sabina soils have illite as the dominant clay mineralogy in the lower third of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shields soils are on ground moraines of low relief and on nearly level hilltops within the strongly morainic areas.  Slopes are plane or slightly convex and range from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in moderately fine and fine textured glacial till or flow till with lacustrine sediments containing appreciable amounts of shale that mantles friable, loam or clay loam till to depths ranging from 3 to 10 feet or more. These sediments are Late Wisconsinan in age.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is approximately 28 to 32 inches.  Frost-free days range from 125 to 170.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 700 to 1600 feet."

These soils formed in materials that are similar to those of the Shields soils and are members of a drainage sequence with the Shields soils.  The moderately well drained Kilkenny and the somewhat poorly drained Lerdal soils are on adjacent gently sloping to steep areas.  Mazaska soils are poorly drained and are nearly level."
