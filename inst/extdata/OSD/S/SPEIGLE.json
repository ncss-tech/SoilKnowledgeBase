  "OVERVIEW": "The Speigle series consists of very deep, well drained soils on basalt plateaus, canyons, and mountain side slopes. They formed in colluvium weathered from basalt mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Slopes are 5 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The Borgeau soils have 2.5Y colors in the Bw horizons and formed in glacial till and colluvium from metamorphic rock. Emily soils have 25 to 35 percent clay in the B horizons. Lenz, Raisio and Vanbrunt soils have a lithic contact between 20 and 40 inches. Garrison and Opportunity soils contain glaciofluvial outwash and have sandy-skeletal subsoil at 24 to 36 inches and 36 to 60 inches respectively. Louiecreek soils are formed in quartz dacite and rhyodacite, do not have an ultic feature and have a base saturation (sum of cations) of 75 to 100 percent except the upper part of the A horizon which is 50 to 75 percent. Whitestone soils have granitic rock fragments and have a high content of quartz and feldspar minerals in the particle-size control section. Sinlahekin soils contain carbonates and range to coarse sandy loam and fine sand in the lower part of the particle size control section."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 17 inches (the A and AB horizons)\nCambic horizon - the zone from 17 to 35 inches (the Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the AB, the Bt, Bt2, and part of the BC horizons)\nVitrandic feature - the zone from 0 to 17 inches (the A and AB horizon)\nThe type location for Speigle has been moved to better reflect a modal site after revisiting the original type location in Spokane County.\nThis pedon does not meet the criteria for an argillic horizon based on no increase in clay from the A horizon to the Bt1 horizon.\nThe description 09/01 reflects a change in classification due to revisions in soil taxonomy from loamy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Ultic Haploxerolls to loamy-skeletal, isotic, mesic Vitrandic Haploxerolls.\nSeries revision 02/04 to remove discontinuity in Bt, BC, and C horizons based on highly mixed ash influence and lack of an ash mantle.\nLouiecreek soils formed in 'rhyodacite and quartz latite' and there is a statement in the Louiecreek OSD that Speigle was previously mapped in the Mt. Tolman Soil Survey, and Louiecreek was written to replace it. These series seem very similar and whether or not they can be realistically separated will require further investigation. In the event they are combined, Speigle covers a greater extent and it would be preferable to maintain it instead of Louiecreek.\nThis series is correlated to the PIPO/SYAL habitat type.\nSpeigle soils should be further investigated to determine typical mineralogy (isotic vs. mixed)."
