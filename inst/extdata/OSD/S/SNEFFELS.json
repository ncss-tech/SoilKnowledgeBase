  "OVERVIEW": "The Sneffels series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to hard sandstone.  They are on ridges, dip slopes, and mountain slopes.  The Sneffels soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from sedimentary bedrock.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches thick and includes the upper part of the argillic horizon in about half the observed pedons.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Where bedrock depth exceeds 30 inches, a BC or C horizon is common.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 34 to 40 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 50 to 56 degrees F.  These soils are noncalcareous throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Coarse fragments, mainly pebbles or channers, range from 0 to 15 percent.  Clay ranges from 20 to 27 percent.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 3 through 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is heavy clay loam or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  It may be modified with 0 to 15 percent pebbles or channers and 0 to 5 percent cobbles or flagstone.  It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline."

The Brinkert, Buckskin, Gothic, Heath, Jerry, Sessions, and Youman soils are deep.  The Florissant soils have a contact to a Bkm at 20 to 40 inches.  Judy and Little Horn soils have horizons of carbonate accumulation.  Mayoworth, Owen Creek, Piltz, and Trout Creek soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Waters soils have hue of 5YR or redder."

Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  Elevations range from 7,000 to 8,500 feet or more.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 23 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 33 to 36 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 45 to 75 days but some south aspects may reach 90 days."
