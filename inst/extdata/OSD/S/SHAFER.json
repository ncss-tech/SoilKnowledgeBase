Breadloaf soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact (stratified silty lacustrine deposits) and have no lithic contact within 40 inches. Karcal soils have an ochric epipedon, a cambic Bss horizon, do not have Btss horizons. Lassen soils have a cambic Bss horizon with hue of 2.5Y and a mollic epipedon greater than 20 inches thick."

Slopes range from 4 to 35 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from welded tuff and basalt mixed with lacustrine deposits. The average annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches. The average annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 140 days."
