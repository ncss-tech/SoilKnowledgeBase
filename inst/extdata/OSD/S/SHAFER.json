  "OVERVIEW": "The Shafer series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with very slow permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from welded tuff and basalt mixed with lacustrine deposits. Slopes range from 4 to 35 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
