  "OVERVIEW": "The Summerfield series consists of deep, somewhat poorly\ndrained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy over\nclayey sediments.  These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping uplands of the southern Coastal Plains.  Slopes range from\n0 to 3 percent.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 40\nto 70 inches.  Depth to clayey IIB' horizon ranges from 18 to 36 inches.\nThe A1 horizon is very dark grayish brown (7.5YR 3/2; 10YR 3/2),\ndark grayish brown (10YR 4/2; 7.5YR 4/2), grayish brown (10YR\n5/2), dark brown (10YR 4/3), or brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Very dark grayish brown colors are restricted to horizons less than 8 inches thick.  The\nA1 horizon is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon is strong brown (7.5YR 5/6, 5/8), brown (7.5YR 5/4; 10YR 5/3), or yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6, 5/8) silt loam,\nloam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  Mottles in shades of gray are common to many.  The Bt horizon averages at\nleast 20 percent more clay than the overlying A horizon.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe A'2 horizon is light brownish gray (10YR 6/2; 2.5Y 6/2), gray (10YR 5/1, 6/1), or grayish brown (10YR 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2) silt, silt loam, or very fine sand.\nThe IIB' horizon is gray (10YR 5/1, 6/1), light grayish brown\n(10YR 6/2; 2.5Y 6/2), light gray (10YR 7/1, 7/2; 2.5Y 5/2) clay, silty clay, or sandy clay.

Augusta, Kullit, Lumbee, Ogeechee, Myatt, Sylacauga, and Yemassee soils lack both A' and clayey IIB'\nhorizons.  Leaf soils have clayey family textures and dominantly 1\nor 2 chroma throughout the B horizon.  Sawyer soils have\nfine-silty over clayey textures and have dominant chromas of 4 or more in the B horizon."

Sandy \"pimple\" mounds are a common feature of the landscape in many areas.\nSlopes are mainly less than 1 percent but range up to 3 percent.\nThe regolith is unconsolidated loamy and clayey acid Coastal Plain sediments.  The climate is warm and humid, mean annual\nprecipitation is 45 inches, and mean annual temperature is 65\ndegrees F., at the type location."

Boswell soils have redder hues and contain more than 35 percent clay throughout the argillic horizon.  Bowie soils are\nless clayey throughout and their argillic horizons contain\nplinthite.  Caddo soils are less clayey and are grayer throughout.  Susquehanna soils have fine textured upper B horizons."
