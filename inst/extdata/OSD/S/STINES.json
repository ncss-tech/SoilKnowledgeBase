  "OVERVIEW": "The Stines series consists of deep and very deep, well drained, moderately rapid permeable soils that are formed in alluvium and residuum of volcanic ash.  They are on hillsides and mesa sides and have slopes of 25 to 75 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees F, and the average annual precipitation is about 360 mm.",
