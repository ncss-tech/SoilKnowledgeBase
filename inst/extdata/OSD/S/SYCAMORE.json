  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean soil temperature ranges from about 60 degrees to 64 degrees F. Unless the soils have intense drainage measures and are not irrigated, the soils do not become dry in all of the upper 20 inches. Mottles with chroma of 2 or less occur in the upper 20 inches. The 10 to 40 inch section is dominantly silt loam with about 18 to 25 percent clay and less than 15 percent material coarser than very fine sand. The surface is usually massive or is cloddy and is hard or very hard, probably due to intense tillage.\nThe A horizon is dominantly grayish brown in lOYR or 2.5Y hue and may be gray in lOYR hue. It is fine sandy loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam. This horizon ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline. The 10 to 20 inch section is not calcareous.\nThe B horizon ranges from grayish brown to light brownish gray or light yellowish brown with hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, chroma 2 through 4, and has distinct to prominent mottles. It is neutral to moderately alkaline with lime in the lower portion in some pedons.\nThe C horizon is light brownish gray to pale olive with distinct to prominent mottles. It is stratified loam, silty clay, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, and silt."

Laugenour and Tyndall soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section. Maria soils are calcareous in all parts. Tamba soils have more than 35 percent clay and are strongly acid. Valdez soils have pale colored epipedons with a moist value of 4. Yolo soils lack mottles and are dry about 7 months of each year."

The climate is dry subhumid, mesothermal with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 20 inches. Average January temperature is 45 degrees ., average July temperature is 75 degrees F., mean annual temperature is 60 degrees to 62 degrees F.; and average frost-free season is 275 to about 300 days."
