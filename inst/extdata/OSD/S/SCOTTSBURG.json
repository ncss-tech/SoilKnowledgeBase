The soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess, loamy slope alluvium, and the underlying residuum from black shale. The shale is from the New Albany Formation, Devonian System. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1143 mm (40 to 45 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the moderately well drained Blocher, Deputy, and Jennings soils, the well drained Cincinnati and Trappist soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Whitcomb soils. Blocher and Deputy soils do not have a horizon with fragic soil properties in the series control section. Cincinnati and Jennings soils have a fragipan in the series control section. Blocher, Cincinnati, and Jennings soils are on higher lying back slopes and shoulders of till plains. Deputy soils are on similar landform positions as the Scottsburg soils. The moderately deep Trappist soils are on risers of strath terraces. Whitcomb soils are on treads of strath terraces."

The depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 46 to 91 cm (1.5 to 3 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface water runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high above the horizon with fragic soil properties and low to moderately high in and below this horizon. Permeability is moderate above the horizon with fragic soil properties and slow or very slow in and below this horizon."

The semiactive CEC class is assigned to this series, but this soil borders on the semiactive and active groups.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data is available for the typical pedon S87IN-143-001 at the National Soil Survey Lab, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
