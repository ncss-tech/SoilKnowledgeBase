  "OVERVIEW": "The Scottsburg series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loess, loamy slope alluvium, and the underlying residuum from black shale. They are moderately deep to a layer with fragic soil properties. Scottsburg soils are on strath terraces within dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

Blocher, Cincinnati, and Jennings soils are on higher lying back slopes and shoulders of till plains. Deputy soils are on similar landform positions as the Scottsburg soils. The moderately deep Trappist soils are on risers of strath terraces. Whitcomb soils are on treads of strath terraces."

The semiactive CEC class is assigned to this series, but this soil borders on the semiactive and active groups.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data is available for the typical pedon S87IN-143-001 at the National Soil Survey Lab, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
