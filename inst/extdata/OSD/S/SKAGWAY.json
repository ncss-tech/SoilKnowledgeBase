Blackcup (T) soils have stony or bouldery surfaces and are strongly or very strongly acid.  Kunayosh (T), Mystem, and Teklanika (T) soils are noncalcareous throughout the profile.  Witefels soils have a paralithic contact within 20 to 40 inches."

The climate is humid maritime with the average annual precipitation ranging from 21 to 60 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost free season is 90 to 150 days.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Elevations range from 0 to 1000 feet."

Ashmun soils are poorly drained, Hollow soils are shallow over extremely gravelly sand, and Tsirku soils have a coarse-loamy control section.  Funter soils consist of peat and occur in muskegs.  Lutak soils occur on alluvial terraces and moraines and have a spodic horizon."
