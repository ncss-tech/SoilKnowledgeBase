  "OVERVIEW": "The Skagway series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Skagway soils occur on floodplains and outwash plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 47 inches.",

Ashmun soils are poorly drained, Hollow soils are shallow over extremely gravelly sand, and Tsirku soils have a coarse-loamy control section.  Funter soils consist of peat and occur in muskegs.  Lutak soils occur on alluvial terraces and moraines and have a spodic horizon."
