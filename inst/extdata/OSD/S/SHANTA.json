  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 27 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 47 to 59 degrees F.  These soils are usually dry in some part between 4 and 12 inches for more than 1/2 the time the soil temperature at 20 inches exceeds 41 degrees F.  The driest period occurs between October and June.  The control section ranges from neutral to moderately alakline.  Carbonates range in form from disseminated throughout the control section to common soft lime concretions, mottles and mycelia in the lower part of the section.  Calcium carbonate  equivalent is estimated to range from 5 to 12 percent in the control section.  The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry,  2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  Organic matter content of the A horizon ranges from 1 to 3 percent and decreases irregularly with depth.  The C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5 dry or moist.  It is stratified and is loam, clay loam, sandy loam, and gravelly sandy loam.  Clay content of the control section ranges from 18 to 35 percent .  Coarse fragments range from 5 to 20 percent in the control section."

Ackman, Gabaldon, and Vegas soils have less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine in the control section.  Draper and Pack soils are saturated with water within 40 inches for 90 days or more when not frozen.  Manzano soils have accumulated calcium carbonate in the lower portion of the profile and have few thin clay films in the B horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  The Shanta soils are on nearly level to gently sloping alluvial fans and floodplains of broad valley slopes at elevations of 5,600 to 6,500 feet.  Parent materials were derived mostly from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  These soils occur in a semiarid continental climate.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 to 15 inches with a summer maximum.  The average annual air temperature is about 45 to 57 degrees F."

Irock and Pena soils are skeletal in the control section.  Remunda soils lack cumulic horizons.  Rinconada soils have less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand and have an argillic horizon."
