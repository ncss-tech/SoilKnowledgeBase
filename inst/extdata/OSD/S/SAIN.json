The mean annual soil temperature is is 50 to 53 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 69 to 72 degrees F.  The soil is dry more than 75 percent of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  They are moist in the moisture control section for fewer than 10 days between July and October.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 40 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bw and C horizons have value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  Clay content is 27 to 35 percent with a few thin strata of soils that have 18 to 27 percent clay.  Texture is dominantly silty clay loam but has layers of silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  The Bw and C horizons are slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent.  Reaction is  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Conductivity of the saturation extract is less than 4 millimhos/cm."

Blueagle and Sagers soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section for more than 10 days between July and October.  Chumall and Rosney soils have relict mottles and are influenced by gypsum in the control section.  Easychair soils have less than 25 percent clay in the control section.  Killpack and Littlehat soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Sondoa soils have manganese oxide stains.  Swingler soils are moderately well drained with relict mottles at a depth that ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Sagrlite and Timpie soils have 18 to 27 percent in the control section. Tocito soils have secondary gypsum in the control section."

These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine from mixed sedimentary rocks.  The climate is arid.  Average annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F., and the freeze-free period is 115 to 145 days."
