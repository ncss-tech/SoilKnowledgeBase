  "OVERVIEW": "The Sain series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slow permeable soils on lake terraces, lake plains and low lying dissected alluvial fans.  They formed in lacustrine and alluvium from mixed sedimentary rocks.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches.",

Calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 40 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bw and C horizons have value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  Clay content is 27 to 35 percent with a few thin strata of soils that have 18 to 27 percent clay.  Texture is dominantly silty clay loam but has layers of silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  The Bw and C horizons are slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent.  Reaction is  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Conductivity of the saturation extract is less than 4 millimhos/cm."
