The change of the cation exchange activity class is an estimate based on NASIS data and similar soils in the major land resource area.\nIn Utah this series is correlated with semidesert range sites.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL) as soil survey sample number 71UT021007 (pedon # 72C0140).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
