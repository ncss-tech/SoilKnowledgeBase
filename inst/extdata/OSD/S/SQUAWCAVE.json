  "OVERVIEW": "The Squawcave series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rocks.  Squawcave soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The change of the cation exchange activity class is an estimate based on NASIS data and similar soils in the major land resource area.\nIn Utah this series is correlated with semidesert range sites.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL) as soil survey sample number 71UT021007 (pedon # 72C0140).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
