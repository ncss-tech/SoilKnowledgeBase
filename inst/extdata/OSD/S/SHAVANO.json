  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. AJC//CRP/JCK",
  "REVDATE": "12/2017",
  "STATES": "CO,NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Shavano series consist of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum derived from sedimentary rock. Shavano soils are on dip slopes, escarpments, strath terraces, fan remnants and pediments. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 279 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
