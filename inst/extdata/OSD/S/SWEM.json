  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F.  The upper part of the particle-size control section has 15 to 35 percent gravel, cobbles, and stone-size basalt fragments and the lower part has 10 to 80 percent siltstone paragravel. Depth to unconformable marine sediments is 20 to 40 inches. Hue of 7.5YR or 10YR. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. Redox depletions with a chroma of 2 or less are at a depth of 10 to 20 inches. The particle-size control section has 18 to 27 percent apparent clay. The soil ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It has granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 3 to 6 dry, and chroma of 3 to 7 moist or dry. It is gravelly silt loam, cobbly silt loam, gravelly loam, gravelly silty clay loam, or cobbly loam.\nThe 2Bw horizon, or 2BC horizon when present, has value of 3 to 6 moist, 5 to 7 dry, chroma of 2 to 6 moist or dry. It is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or loam. Some pedons lack a 2Bw horizon and have a massive 2BC horizon."

Ozette soils have 10 to 30 percent hard rock fragments throughout the particle-size control section and 4 to 7 percent organic carbon throughout the upper two-thirds of the particle-size control section. Sylvia soils have 35 to 50 percent apparent clay and lack rock fragments in the particle-size control section."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Swem soils formed in material weathered from a mixture of colluvial basalt and volcanic ash over marine sediments. They are in a coastal marine climate with cool wet winters and cool dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is 70 to 120 inches. The mean January temperature is 38 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 60 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F. The growing season (28 degrees F) is about 200 to 240 days."
