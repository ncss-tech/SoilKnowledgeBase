  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the loess mantle and the solum ranges from 14 to 30 inches.  The exchange complex of the solum is dominated by amorphous material.  The upper 4 inches of the spodic horizons have less than 1.2 percent organic carbon.  Coarse fragment content within the control section below the solum is less than 35 percent.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nWhere present, the texture of the A horizon is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThin E horizons are present in many pedons.  Value moist is 4 or 5, and chroma moist is 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bs horizon has, value moist of 3 or 4; and chroma moist from 2 through 4.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value moist from 4 to 6 and chroma moist from 2 to 6.\nThe 2C horizon is variegated, but with a dominant hue from 10YR to 2.5Y."
