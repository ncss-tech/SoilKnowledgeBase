  "OVERVIEW": "The Susannaberg series consists of shallow, well drained, slowly permeable soils on summits and side slopes of volcanic hills and mountains.  They formed in material weathered from volcanic residuum.  Near the type location, the mean annual air temperature is about 80 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches. Slopes range from 12 to 90 percent.",
