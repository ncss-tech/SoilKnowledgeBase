  "OVERVIEW": "The Setters series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loess or loess over silty sediments.  Setters soils are on ridge summits, backslopes and footslopes of hills on dissected basalt plateaus, mountains and benches.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
