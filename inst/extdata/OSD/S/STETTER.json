  "OVERVIEW": "The Stetter series consists of deep or very deep, well drained soils formed in clayey alluvium on floodplains and bottom lands.  Permeability is slow or very slow.  Slopes are less than 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about l5 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils typically lack carbonates throughout, but some pedons have thin strata that contain carbonates and have carbonates within 15 inches of the surface.  The particle-size control section averages between 45 and 60 percent clay.  When the soil is dry, cracks l/2 to 2 inches wide and several feet long extend to depths of 4 feet or more.  These soils formed in alluvium that has evident stratification.  Thin dark-colored strata and buried horizons are common.  Some pedons have thin strata of sand or silt.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Where it has a color value of 5.5 or less dry and 3.5 or less moist it is too thin for a mollic epipedon.  The A horizon typically is clay but some pedons are silty clay or silty clay loam.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have varved or platy layers of recent deposition on the surface.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of l or 2.  The dark colors are inherent from the parent material.  The C horizon is clay or silty clay.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  It has weak blocky structure or is massive, and some pedons have unaltered horizontal bedding planes.  The material below depths of 40 inches ranges from loamy sand through clay and includes bedded shale."

Arvada soils have natric horizons.  Kyle and Swanboy soils have cambic horizons.  Haverson and Lohmiller soils are on similar bottom lands.  Haverson soils are fine-loamy.  Lohmiller soils contain from 35 to 45 percent clay and contain free carbonates.  The Wasa and Winler soils are on the nearby uplands and have bedded shale within depths of 40 inches."
