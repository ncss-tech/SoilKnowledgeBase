Fragments of sandstone range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in the A and B horizons and from 0 to 30 percent in the C horizon. The fragments are chiefly up to 3 inches in diameter.  The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid except where limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Horizons with value of 3 are less than 7 inches thick.  The E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 6 and chroma of 2 to 4.  The A and E horizons are loam, fine sandy loam or silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4, except some pedons have chroma of 2 in the lower part.  Mottles of chroma 2 or less are within 24 inches of the soil surface.  It is loam, fine sandy loam or silt loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 1 to 4.  Mottles are in shades of gray and brown.  The fine earth textures are loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam."
