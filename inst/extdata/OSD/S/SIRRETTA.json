  "OVERVIEW": "The Sirretta series consists of moderately deep, excessively drained soils formed in material weathered from granitic rocks. Sirretta soils are on mountain slopes and ridges with slopes of 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 26 inches and the mean annual temperature is 40 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The soil between depths of about 12 and 35 inches usually becomes moist in all parts in late October or November and remains moist until mid-July. It is dry in all parts the rest of the year. Mean annual soil temperature is 40 degrees F. Mean summer temperature is 65 degrees F. The soil at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F from mid-April to October 31 and greater than 47 degrees F from May 1 to October 15. Rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 90 percent. The soil is slightly acid to medium acid. Base saturation ranges from 20 to 35 percent throughout the profile and decreases with depth.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 3/3, 4/2, or 6/3, and moist color of 10YR 2/2 or 4/3. It has weak granular structure or is single-grain.\nThe C horizons have dry color of 10YR 6/4, 5/3, or 4/4, and moist color of 10YR 5/4, 4/4, or 4/3."

Elevations are 7,000 to 10,000 feet. The climate is semiarid with cool moist winters and warm dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches which occurs mostly as snow and is melted by mid-June. Mean annual temperature varies from 35 degrees to 45 degrees F, and the frost-free season is about 75 to 125 days."
