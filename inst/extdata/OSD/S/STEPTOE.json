  "OVERVIEW": "The Steptoe series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from limestone with admixtures of quartzite. Steptoe soils occur on stream terraces and drainageways in mountains. Slopes range from 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
