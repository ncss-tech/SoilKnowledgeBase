  "OVERVIEW": "The Sylvester series consists of well drained soils moderately deep to sandstone.  They formed in loess and in the underlying residuum weathered from the sandstone.  These upland soils have moderate permeability.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  The loess ranges in thickness from 20 to 33 inches, and the depth to sandstone is 24 to 40 inches.  The sandstone is considered to have a paralithic contact at less than 40 inches and 2Cr horizons can be designated.  The sandstone becomes more strongly cemented with depth, but can still be dug with difficulty with a spade.  The solum generally occupies the entire profile above bedrock; however, a thin 2C horizon is in some pedons.  At least 6 inches of the lower part of the soil profile above sandstone, in the position of 2BC or 2C, is loamy sand or sand.  The solum, and the 2C horizon where present, are slightly acid to strongly acid.  Where limed, some pedons have neutral surface horizons.\nThe A horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue and value and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe AB horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The Bt horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The Bt horizon has an average clay content ranging between 24 and 30 percent and less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.  Clay films range from few faint and patchy to faint; and continuous on faces of peds.\nThe 2BC horizon has 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR hue; value and chroma is 4 through 6.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand.  Generally a loamy sand 2BC horizon, 6 or more inches thick, rests directly on sandstone without an intervening 2C horizon.  Soils having 2BC horizons of loamy very fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam are within the range of the series provided that they are underlain by sandy 2C horizons 6 inches or more thick.\nThe 2C horizon, where present has colors intermediate between the 2BC and 2Cr horizons.  It is loamy sand or sand, infrequently with a few pebbles.  It ranges in thickness from 0 to about 10 inches.  The upper 12 to 18 inches of the sandstone may be dug with difficulty with a spade.  Color is variable and typically hues are 10YR or 7.5YR with value of 5 through 8, and chroma of 2 through 6."

The Pillot and Whitehall soils do not have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  Arland soils have an ochric epipedon and are fine-loamy.  Gale soils are similar but have an ochric epipedon.  Hesch soils have a mollic epipedon, but are coarse-loamy.  Richwood soils have a mollic epipedon, but are fine-silty."
