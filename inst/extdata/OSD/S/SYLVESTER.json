  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  The loess ranges in thickness from 20 to 33 inches, and the depth to sandstone is 24 to 40 inches.  The sandstone is considered to have a paralithic contact at less than 40 inches and 2Cr horizons can be designated.  The sandstone becomes more strongly cemented with depth, but can still be dug with difficulty with a spade.  The solum generally occupies the entire profile above bedrock; however, a thin 2C horizon is in some pedons.  At least 6 inches of the lower part of the soil profile above sandstone, in the position of 2BC or 2C, is loamy sand or sand.  The solum, and the 2C horizon where present, are slightly acid to strongly acid.  Where limed, some pedons have neutral surface horizons.\nThe A horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue and value and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe AB horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The Bt horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The Bt horizon has an average clay content ranging between 24 and 30 percent and less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.  Clay films range from few faint and patchy to faint; and continuous on faces of peds.\nThe 2BC horizon has 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR hue; value and chroma is 4 through 6.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand.  Generally a loamy sand 2BC horizon, 6 or more inches thick, rests directly on sandstone without an intervening 2C horizon.  Soils having 2BC horizons of loamy very fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam are within the range of the series provided that they are underlain by sandy 2C horizons 6 inches or more thick.\nThe 2C horizon, where present has colors intermediate between the 2BC and 2Cr horizons.  It is loamy sand or sand, infrequently with a few pebbles.  It ranges in thickness from 0 to about 10 inches.  The upper 12 to 18 inches of the sandstone may be dug with difficulty with a spade.  Color is variable and typically hues are 10YR or 7.5YR with value of 5 through 8, and chroma of 2 through 6."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Pillot and Whitehall series in the same family and the Arland, Gale, Hesch, and Richwood series.  The Pillot and Whitehall soils do not have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  Arland soils have an ochric epipedon and are fine-loamy.  Gale soils are similar but have an ochric epipedon.  Hesch soils have a mollic epipedon, but are coarse-loamy.  Richwood soils have a mollic epipedon, but are fine-silty."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sylvester soils are mainly on ridgetops of uplands underlain by sandstone bedrock.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.  They formed in loess 20 to 33 inches thick and in the underlying residuum weathered from sandstone.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 35 inches."

Lighter colored, thinner sola soils such as Northfield, are on steeper positions in the same landscape.  Richwood and Tama soils are on benches below the Sylvester soils and are distinguished by their thicker loess mantles and greater depth to bedrock."
