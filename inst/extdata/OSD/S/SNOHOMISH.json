  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The average annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 49 to 52 degrees F.  The upper part of the particle-size control section lacks coarse fragments, averages less than 15 percent fine and coarser sand, and averages 18 to 35 percent clay, and l5 to 60 percent volcanic ash. Depth to the organic layers ranges from 14 to 36 inches.  These soils have an irregular distribution of organic matter with depth.  Fibers in the lower part of the particle-size control section are mostly from grasses and sedges, but pedons average up to 15 percent wood fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 3 through 6 moist, 5 through 8 dry, and chroma of 0 through 2 moist and dry.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or mucky silt loam.\nThe O horizons have hue of 2.5YR through 2.5Y, value 1 through 4 moist, 1 through 5 dry, and chroma of 0 through 4 moist and dry.  Individual layers are sapric material or hemic material or stratified woody mucky peat, muck, sedge mucky peat, and sedimentary peat. The fiber content ranges from 20 to 80 percent unrubbed and 1 to 25 percent rubbed.  Thin discontinuous layers of volcanic ash and diatomaceous earth (1/2 to 2 inches thick) occur between 24 and 48 inches in some pedons. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.  Some pedons have a mineral C horizon below 40 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Snohomish soils are on flood plains and backswamps of flood plains at elevations of 5 to 300 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in alluvium with a component of volcanic ash underlain by organic materials.  These soils are in a mild marine climate.  Average annual precipitation is 22 to 50 inches.  The average January temperature is about 38 degrees F; average July temperature is about 64 degrees F; and the average annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 160 to 220 days."
