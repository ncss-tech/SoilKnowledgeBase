These soils formed in residuum weathered from sandstone and greenstone of the Franciscan Formation. Elevation is 985 to 2975 feet. The climate is subhumid, mesothermal with warm, dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 55 to 59 degrees F. The frost free season is 200 to 250 days."
