  "OVERVIEW": "The Sanikara series consists of very shallow and shallow to lithic contact, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from sandstone and greenstone. The Sanikara soils are on hills, mountain slopes and summits. Slopes range from 8 to 100 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 57 degrees F.",
