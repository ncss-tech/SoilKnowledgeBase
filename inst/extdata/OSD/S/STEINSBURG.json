  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments of quartzite pebbles and sandstone channers range from 0 to 20 percent in the solum and from 15 to 60 percent in the C horizon.  The weighted average of rock fragments is less than 35 percent in the textural control section.  The reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout the soil unless limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR through  5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Fine-earth textures are loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  The fine-earth fraction is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam and contains 10 to 18 percent clay.  Structure is weak, fine or medium subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  The fine-earth fraction is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy sand. It is massive and the consistence is friable."
