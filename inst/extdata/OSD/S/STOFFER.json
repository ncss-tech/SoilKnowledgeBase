  "OVERVIEW": "The Stoffer series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from conglomerate. These soils are on fan remnants and hillslopes. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C.",
