  "OVERVIEW": "The Soper series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from conglomerate and sandstone. Soper soils are on hills and uplands and have slopes of 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a paralithic contact is 24 to 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 60 degrees to 65 degrees F.  at 20 inches depth and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F. at any time.  The soil between depths of about 6 and 16 inches is continuously dry in all parts from late April or May until late October or November and usually is moist in some part all the rest of the year.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown, dark grayish brown, or brown in 10YR hue. It is loam or less commonly sandy loam and is commonly gravelly or cobbly with 0 to 20 percent rock fragments by volume. The horizon usually has weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure and is slightly hard or hard. In some pedons it is massive in some part and slightly hard. The A horizon is neutral to medium acid. It contains 1 to 4 percent organic matter to depth of about 10 inches and the amount decreases regularly to less than 1 percent at a depth of about 15 inches.\nThe B2t horizon is brown, dark brown or light yellowish brown in 10YR or 7.5YR hue or reddish brown in 5YR hue. It is gravelly or cobbly clay loam or gravelly or cobbly sandy clay loam and has 25 to 35 percent clay. This horizon is slightly acid to mildly alkaline. Some pedons have horizons transitional to the B2t horizon and have either or both Bl or B3 horizons. Some pedons have a C horizon above the paralithic contact that is gravelly or cobbly loam or gravelly or cobbly sandy loam."

They formed in material weathered from conglomerate and sandstone. The climate is dry subhumid, mesothermal with warm to hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 25 inches. Mean annual temperature is 58 degrees to 65 degrees F. Average January temperature is abut 45 degrees to 5O degrees F. and July temperature is about 70 degrees to 75 degrees F. The frost-free season ia about 250 to 350 days."

Arnold soils are sand or loamy sand and lack an argillic horizon. Azule and Los Osos soils have argillic hor;zons with more than 35 percent clay. Balcom soils lack an argillic horizon and are calcareous throughout. Cieneba soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches. Fontana soils lack an argillic horizon and have a Cca horizon. Gaviota soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches. Los Gatos soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 degrees to 58 degrees F. Pleasanton soils lack a mollic epipedon and lack a paralithic contact above a depth of 40 inches. Vallecitos soils lack a mollic epipedon and have a lithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches in part of each pedon."
