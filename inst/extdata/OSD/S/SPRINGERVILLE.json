Antelopeflat have accumulations of gypsum in the profile. Arboles soils formed in parent material derived from shale. Dominquez soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR. Ritoazul soils are moderately deep to shale and have accumulations of gypsum in the profile. Sideshow soils are effervescent at 10 inches, contain less than 5 percent calcium carbonates equivalents and do not have 5YR hue."
