  "OVERVIEW": "The Springerville series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from tuff, volcanic breccia and basalt.  Springerville soils are on plateaus and mesas and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
