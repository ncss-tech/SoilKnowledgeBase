  "OVERVIEW": "The Swinomish series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in glacial till with an  admixture of loess and volcanic ash.  These soils are on glacial till plains; slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The  average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
