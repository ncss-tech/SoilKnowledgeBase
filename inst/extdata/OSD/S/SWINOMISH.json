These  soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 75 to 90 days following the summer  solstice.  base saturation is 35 to 75 percent throughout the control section.  Coarse fragments in the  control section average from 35 to 50 percent and consist of pebbles and cobbles.  The mean annual soil temperature  is estimated to range from 48 to 52 degrees F.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR and 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and  dry.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6  moist and dry. It is gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam, or very gravelly fine sandy loam.\nThe B3 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 moist and dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It  is very gravelly fine sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.

Blethen,  Heisler and Lyre soils lack a paralithic contact within depths of 60 inches.  Neer soils have base  saturation of 10 to 20 percent in the B horizon, and contain shot- like pebbles throughout the control section.   Ogarty, Pickett and Squires soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Vanzandt soils are dry in the  moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Swinomish soils are on glaciated uplands at elevations of l00 to 1,200 feet.  Slopes are  0 to 30 percent.  They formed in glacial till with an admixture of loess and volcanic ash.  These soils have a  mild marine climate with cool dry summers and cool moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 20 to 30  inches.  Average January temperature is about 36 degrees F. and average July temperature is about 64 degrees  F. and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 160 to 210 days."
