  "OVERVIEW": "The Spang series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from scorio.    These soils are on sedimentary plain, alluvial fans, and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
