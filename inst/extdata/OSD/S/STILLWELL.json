  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Stillwell series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on erosional fan and pediment remnants. These soils formed in gravelly alluvium and colluvium, derived from flaggy limestone of the Boquillas Formation. Slope ranges 1 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 279 mm (11 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.1 degrees C (70 degrees F).",
