  "OVERVIEW": "The Straycow series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from metamorphic rock. Straycow soils are on hills. Slope ranges from 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

Elevations are 2,700 to 4,500 feet. The climate is a low-latitude desert with mild winters and very hot summer. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in summer typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 7 inches; mean annual temperature is 57 to 63 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 180 to 240 days."
