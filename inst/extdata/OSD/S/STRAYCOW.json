  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Straycow soils are on hills. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from metamorphic bedrock. Slope ranges from 8 to 50 percent. Elevations are 2,700 to 4,500 feet. The climate is a low-latitude desert with mild winters and very hot summer. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in summer typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 7 inches; mean annual temperature is 57 to 63 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 180 to 240 days."
