  "OVERVIEW": "The Shioya series consists of deep and very deep, rapidly permeable, excessively drained soils. They are on coastal strands and formed in water-deposited coral sand. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 90 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F.",
