    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sylvaille soils are on fan remnants and outwash plains in mountain valleys.  They formed in glaciofluvial deposits with a minor influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  Elevations range from 1,370 to 1,675 meters.  The climate is characterized as cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 24 inches (355 to 610 millimeters), and the mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C.  The frost free period is 30 to 80 days."

Choptie soils are on isolated fan remnants and are shallow to tuffaceous sandstone.  Gerow and Silvies are on broad floodplains and have redoximorphic concentrations within 75 centimeters of the soil surface.  Humarel soils are on forested hillslopes and are clayey-skeletal.  Keerins soils are on low hills and are very shallow or shallow to shale.  Luckycreek soils are on broad terraces located below fan remnants and are fine-loamy.  Pothole soils are in kettle depressions within glaciofluvial deposits (Sylvaille soils)."

Satisfies all requirements for a vitrandic epipedon but lacks the necessary thickness\nParticle-size control section - 0 to 33 cm (A and 2Bt horizons)\nDensic layers - 33 to 127 cm (3Cd1, 3Cd2, and 3Cd3 horizons)\nSoil moisture regime: Xeric\n03/13:  The Loganvalley OSD was originally set up in Logan Valley, Grant County, Oregon in 2001.  The original classification of Loganvalley was Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Vitrandic Argixerolls.  Minimal data was collected at the time Loganvalley was proposed and it was given a depth class of very deep.  Subsequently, during the summers 2010 and 2011, significantly more data was collected using a backhoe on Loganvalley soils in Bear Valley, Grant County, Oregon.  The additional data dictated the need to move the Loganvalley type location to Bear Valley, rename the series to Sylvaille, and reclassify the series to Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid, shallow Typic Argixerolls.  No till was recognized in the original Logavalley OSD, but numerous backhoe excavations and geologic analysis showed till was present and needed to be recognized as Cd horizons.\nThe pronunciation of the Sylvaille series name is \"sil-vay\" - French pronunciation based on a historic French trapper.\nFrequently the soil surface this soil is littered with sub-rounded, gravel-sized fragments of shale, tuff, limestone, serpentine, and occasionally obsidian\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
