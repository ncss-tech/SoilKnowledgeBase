  "OVERVIEW": "The Snilloc series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in alluvium and eolian deposits derived from mixed sources.  Snilloc soils are on nearly level to rolling hillslopes, structural benches and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 36 centimeters (14 inches). Mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.)",
