  "OVERVIEW": "The Southcamp series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from porphyritic trachyte flows. The Southcamp soils are on hill-slopes and ridge tops. Slopes range from 9 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 660 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
