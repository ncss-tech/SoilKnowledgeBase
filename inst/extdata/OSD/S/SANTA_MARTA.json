  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. SRT; JLL; GRB",
  "REVDATE": "08/2007",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Santa Marta series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on side slopes of serpentinite hills and mountains of the Humid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  They formed in residuum weathered from serpentinite bedrock.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 57 inches.  Slopes range from 20 to 40 percent.",
