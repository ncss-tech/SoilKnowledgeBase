    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Caldwell, Harana, Jett, Keigley, Loupence, Red Rock, and Rustico series. Caldwell soils have distinct redox concentrations and are somewhat poorly drained. Harana soils are moderately alkaline, calcareous, and average 27 to 35 percent clay within the particle-size control section and are well drained. Jett soils are calcareous in all or part of the A horizon and within the upper part of the particle-size control section. Keigley soils are calcareous and have 15 to 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent throughout. Loupence soils have an aridic soil moisture regime. Red Rock soils have calcareous C horizons above depth of 40 inches. Rustico soils have redox concentrations between 50 and 60 inches, are calcareous throughout, and have an aridic soil moisture regime bordering xeric."

These soils formed in loess and alluvium from loess. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The summers are hot and dry and winters are cool and moist. The average annual precipitation is typically 18 to 23 inches but ranges to 13 inches in northeastern Oregon. The average annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.; the average January temperature is 28 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 68 degrees F. Frost-free season is 100 to 125 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - from the surface to 33 inches (the Ap, A1, and A2 horizons).\nCumulic feature - conceptual and assumed - based on parent material (alluvium) and landform (terrace) and slopes less than 25 percent.\nThe Snow series and the type location are no longer recognized in Spokane County as investigated during the Spokane County update (extensive revision) mainly due to the lack soil features and properties indicative of the cumulic subgroup. The Snow investigated during the Spokane update had soil properties and qualities consistent with criteria associated with the Pachic subgroup criteria or was mapped where the dominant component was wetter than Snow. The type location was moved to Whitman County in 03/2012 because that is the largest remaining acreage extent.\nMLRA 9 update notes- further investigation is needed to determine the presence and extent of the volcanic ash influence and verification of cumulic subgroup criteria on slopes greater than 3 percent up to 30 (taxonomic criteria requires slope less than 25 percent) percent. Perhaps there is a need to investigate and possibly separate (or combine in a complex) the Snow soils derived in loess (well drained, not cumulic) and Snow soils derived in loessal alluvium (soil moisture regimes wetter than well drained, cumulic). In addition, map unit complexes composed of two major components would better fit the landscape/landforms in some areas.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
