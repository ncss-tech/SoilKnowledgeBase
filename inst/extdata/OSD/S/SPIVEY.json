  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Fragments of low-grade metasedimentary rocks such as metasandstone, metagraywacke, slate, phyllite, or arkose, range from 15 to 75 percent in the A and Bw1 horizons, from 35 to 90 percent in the Bw2, BC  and C horizon.  Reaction is moderately acid to extremely acid throughout.  Flakes of mica range from none to common.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.  Dry value is less than 5. The fine earth fraction is loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam or silt loam\nThe Bw horizons have hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 8.  The fine earth fraction is loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam or silt loam.\nThe BC and C horizons (where present) have hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 8.  The fine earth fraction is loam, sandy loam, silt loam or loamy sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Brightwood, Cullasaja, Harrington, Klickitat, Milbury, and Wauld Series and the closely related Guyandotte, Nordby,  Skoly, Steever, and Summers Series.  Brightwood, Harrington, Milbury, Summers, and Wauld soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Cullasaja soils formed in colluvium weathered from high-grade metasedimentary rocks such as mica gneiss and hornblende gneiss and contain fragments of those rocks.  Guyandotte soils formed from colluvium weathered from sandstone, siltstone, and shale, and contain fragments of those rocks.  Nordby soils formed in mixed continental and valley glacial outwash.  Klickitat, Skoly, Steever soils formed in colluvium weathered from basalt and andesite, and contain fragments of those rocks."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Spivey soils are on gently sloping to very steep slopes  along drainageways, on benches and fans, and in coves in the Southern Blue Ridge (MLRA 130B).  Elevation ranges from about 1,200 to 4,800 feet.  Slopes are commonly 15 to 50 percent, but range from 2 to 95 percent.  They formed in colluvium and local alluvium derived from materials weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks such as metasandstone and phyllite.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 50 degrees to 57 degrees F.  and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 45 to 80 inches."

All these soils except Maymead, Santeetlah, and Whiteoak are residual upland soils.  Maymead is coarse-loamy and Santeetlah and Whiteoak fine-loamy colluvium."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part and rapid in the lower part.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) is moderately rapid.  Index of surface runoff is very low on slopes less than 8 percent and low to medium on strongly sloping to steep slopes. The seasonal high water table is greater than 6 feet throughout most of the year.  These soils receive surface and subsurface water from surrounding uplands and seeps and springs are common."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of this soil is in forest.  Below 3,000 feet the dominant forest type is yellow poplar.  As elevation increases the forest type is more mixed and consists of northern red oak, black cherry, sugar maple, American beech, black oak, black birch, yellow birch, sweet birch, yellow-poplar, eastern hemlock, and black locust.  At elevations above 4,000 feet yellow birch replaces yellow-poplar as a common tree.  In the drier, warmer part of MLRA 130B, upland oaks, hickory, black gum, red maple, and eastern white pine are associated.  Flowering dogwood, mountain-laurel, silverbell, striped maple, serviceberry, rhododendron, red maple, blueberry, trillium, Solomons seal, and wood fern are common understory species."
