Cazenovia and Hilton soils have a B/E horizon in the upper part of the series control section. Kidami soils have hue redder than 10YR in the lower part of the series control section. Lima soils are less than 89 cm (35 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Miami soils average more than 27 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Pevely soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Rainsville soils have less than 5 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Rawson soils average more than 27 percent clay in the lower part of the solum. Summitville soils have at least one subhorizon in the argillic horizon that has hue redder than 7.5YR. Vaughnsville soils have hue redder than 10YR in the surface layer."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1067 mm (27 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 180 days.

The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 61 to 107 cm (2 to 3.5 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the loamy solum, very high in the sandy and gravelly substratum, and low in the underlying till substratum. Permeability is moderate in the loamy solum, rapid in the sandy and gravelly substratum, and slow or very slow in the underlying till substratum."
