  "REVDATE": "05/2023",
  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Siebert series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from schist and micaceous gneiss or sedimentary rocks.  These soils are on gently to steeply sloping hills, ridges, and mountain side slopes. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.",
