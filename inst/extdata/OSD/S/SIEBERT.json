  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 40 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature is about 51 degrees F.  Thin Al horizons are present in some pedons.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent in all subhorizons of the argillic horizon.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the top of the argillic horizon is less than 24 inches and depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 17 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 75 percent in a major part of the solum and C horizon and they are mainly 1/4 to 10 inches in diameter.  Sand and silt fractions contain 5 to 40 percent or more of flat mica platelets of sufficient size to affect the soils physical condition.\nThe A1 horizon, if present, has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It has lamellae of sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam or clay loam in a coarse textured matrix.  If mixed proportionately to their occurrence in the pedon the composite texture of the fine earth fraction in the lamellae and matrix is not finer than loamy fine sand.  This horizon ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon, if present above the schist, ranges from 5Y through 7.5YR; subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  It is gravelly or very gravelly loamy sand or sand. This horizon ranges from medium acid to neutral."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Hyannis, Troutville, and Yochum series.   Hyannis soils have only small amounts of mica and lack the physical properties introduced by high mica content.  Troutville soils lack a paralithic contact within the control section.  Yochum soils have hue of 5YR or redder and have little or no mica."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Siebert soils are on gently to steeply sloping hills, ridges, and mountainsides.  Slopes typically range from about 2 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in moderately thin very micaceous coarse textured materials weathered from schist and micaceous gneiss or sedimentary rocks.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  Mean annual temperature is 36 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 52 degrees F."
