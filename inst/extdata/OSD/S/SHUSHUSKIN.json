    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 47 to 52 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 35 inches and includes the upper part of the argillic horizon.  The upper 10 to 18 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass 7 to 25 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 0.7 percent, and the 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section has 27 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. It has 5 to 15 percent rock fragments by volume.  Organic matter is estimated to range from 3 to 5 percent in the Ap and A horizons.  Solum thickness and depth to lithic contact with basalt is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  It is loam or silt loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe AB horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  It is silt loam or loam.\nThe 2Bt horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  The 2Bt1 horizon is silt loam, loam, or clay loam.  The 2Bt2 horizon is clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 3Btb horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma or 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly clay loam, clay loam or gravelly clay loam."

Morical soils are 20 to 40 inches to paralithic contact and have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick.  Pachneum and Umperon soils are greater than 60 inches to a lithic contact.  Mozen soils have secondary carbonates at a depth of 23 to 37 inches and are dry for 90 to 100 consecutive days.  Ralock and Rollinger soils are greater than 60 inches to lithic contact and are dry for 100 to 120 consecutive days.  Teewee soils are 40 to 60 inches to a paralithic contact and have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick.   Tolius and Wockum soils are very deep to bedrock."

These soils formed in loess mixed with volcanic ash in the surface, slope alluvium and some residuum from basalt.  Elevation is 2,000 to 3,600 feet.  These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches.  Average January temperature is about 25 degrees F. and average July temperature is about 69 degrees F.  Average annual temperature is 46 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 135 days."
