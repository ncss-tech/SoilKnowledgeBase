  "OVERVIEW": "The Shushuskin series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess mixed with volcanic ash in the surface, slope alluvium and some residuum from basalt.  They are on hillslopes, dissected plateaus and piedmont slopes.  Slopes are 3 to 30 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 17 inches and average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 35 inches and includes the upper part of the argillic horizon.  The upper 10 to 18 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass 7 to 25 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 0.7 percent, and the 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section has 27 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. It has 5 to 15 percent rock fragments by volume.  Organic matter is estimated to range from 3 to 5 percent in the Ap and A horizons.
