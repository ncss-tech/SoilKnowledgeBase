  "OVERVIEW": "The Sundance series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material over loess.  Sundance soils occupy a position between silty soils and deep sand and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 57 degrees F.",

Depth to carbonates ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  The soils range from neutral to moderately alkaline.  The epipedon has less than .6 percent organic carbon.  Rock fragments range up to 5 percent in the upper part of the profile and there are very few in the buried part.  The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon averages 18 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has Hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam or sandy clay loam and averages 12 to 30 percent clay.\nThe 2Btb horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4.

All of these soils lack lithologic discontinuities except the Millett and Fattig soils and in both of these soils the lithologic discontinuity occurs at the base of the solum.  Fattig soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Millett soils have hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR and contain 10 to 35 percent gravel in the B horizon."
