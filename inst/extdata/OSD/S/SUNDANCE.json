All of these soils lack lithologic discontinuities except the Millett and Fattig soils and in both of these soils the lithologic discontinuity occurs at the base of the solum.  Fattig soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Millett soils have hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR and contain 10 to 35 percent gravel in the B horizon."
