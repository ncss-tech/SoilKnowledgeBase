  "STATES": "IN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Strole series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in lacustrine deposits of calcareous silty clay or clay on glacial lakebeds. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C  (50 degrees F).",
