  "STATES": "UT,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Spenlo series consists of well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that were formed in mixed alluvium from sandstone, shale, limestone, and siltstone.  These soils are on gently sloping to strongly sloping old alluvial valleys. Slopes are 2 to 10 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 13 inches.",

Alvey soils have hue of 10YR or yellower. Barx soils contain 2.5YR and 5YR hue. Cerrillos soils have a calcic horizon less than 20 inches deep. Clovis soils receive more than half of it annual precipitation between the months of July and October. Fernando soils contain 50 to 80 percent silt in the solum and are mapped in MLRA 51. Cabreros, Flaco, Horchata, Progresso, Sanostee, and Threetop soils are moderately deep over bedrock. Maysdorf soils contain less than 15 percent carbonates in the calcic horizon. Millett soils contain 25 to 75 percent gravel and cobbles in the lower part of the solum. Palabria soils are deep to sandstone. Selpats soils have skeletal lithologic discontinuity at depths ranging from 15 to 39 inches. Scholle soils contain 15 to 35 percent gravel in the control section. Solirec soils receive maximum precipitation in spring and fall. Tuweep soils are formed in alluvium from pyroclastics and basalt. Wineg soils have a MAST of 56 degrees F, and have mixed gravelly alluvium or lacustrine parent material."
