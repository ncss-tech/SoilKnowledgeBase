In addition, Delgado soils are deeper to bedrock, and Splanod soils are intermittently moist in some part of the moisture control section from July to September.  Tidwell and Trigger soils are derived from sedimentary rocks.  Tidwell soils have redder hues and Trigger soils have a MAST of 61 to 64."

Elevations are 2,200 to 2,800 feet.  The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and cool winters.  Most precipitation comes in the winter but in some areas it is sporadic.  The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 65 to 69 degrees F.  Mean July temperature is about 78 degrees F., and mean January temperature is about 42 degrees F.
