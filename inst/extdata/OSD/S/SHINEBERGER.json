  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Shineberger series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum derived from calcareous sedimentary rock. These soils occur on escarpments, hills, mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes are 4 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
