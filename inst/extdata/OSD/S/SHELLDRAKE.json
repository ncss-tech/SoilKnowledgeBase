  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Simescreek and Twinmound series. Simescreek soils have 5 percent or more of silt plus clay in the upper 25 to 50 centimeters. Twinmound soils have a paralithic contact within 150 centimeters. Closely related or similar soils are the Deer Park, Eastport, Feldtmann, Grayling, Menahga, Nymore and Shawano series. Deer Park, Eastport, Grayling, Menahga, Nymore and Shawano soils have darker subsoils and contain more weatherable minerals. Feldtmann soils have redder hues."
