  "OVERVIEW": "The Silcox series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in moderately coarse textured glacial till weathered mostly from andesitic and basaltic rocks. Silcox soils are on hillsides in glaciated valleys in mountainous areas and have slopes of 5 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist but is dry between depths of 8 to 24 inches for a short period of less than 45 consecutive days after the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F. Thickness of the solum is 18 to 30 inches.  Depth to a cemented basal till layer ranges from 4 to 6 feet.  Depth to bedrock commonly is greater than 60 inches. The control section ranges from fine sandy loam to sandy loam and has 10 to 35 percent rock fragments and 10 to 18 percent clay.  Moist bulk density is 0.85 to 0.95 grams per cubic centimeter throughout.\nThe A horizon is dark gray (10YR 3/1), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) or dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) when moist.  It has an estimated acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent and less than 2.0 cmol per kg fine earth of 1N KCL extractable aluminum.\nThe Bw horizon colors are variegated with the dominant moist value of 3 to depth of 20 inches or more and chroma of 3 to depth of 20 inches or more and 3 or 4 below 20 inches.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. Rock fragments range from 25 to 50 percent."

The soils formed in moderately coarse textured glacial till of late Pleistocene origin and weathered mostly from andesitic and basaltic rocks.  The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 80 to 120 inches.  The mean January temperature is 34 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 64 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 160 days."
