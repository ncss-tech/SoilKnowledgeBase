The mean annual summer soil temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  The reaction is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 7 dry, 2 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Textures include sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, loam, stony clay loam or stony sandy clay loam, gravelly sandy clay loam, gravelly clay loam or cobbly sandy clay loam and has 10 to 35 percent rock fragments.
