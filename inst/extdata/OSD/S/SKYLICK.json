  "OVERVIEW": "The Skylick series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in glacial till and colluvium from sandstone.  Skylick soils are on complex mountainsides.  Slopes are 4 to 70 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 25 inches and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
