The Ildcarb soils contain 5 to 15 percent gypsum in the fine earth fraction in the 10 to 40 inch section.  The Ladron soils have a lithologic discontinuity within a depth of 40 inches.  The Moab soils contain less than 18 percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch particle size control section.  The Puice, Socorro, and Tusayan soils have bedrock between a depth of 20 and 40 inches. Storsun soils have hue of 10YR."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Stormitt soils are on sloping stream terraces, benches, hillslopes, and fans at elevations of 4,000 to 6,800 feet.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  The alluvium is from a mixture of limestone, diorite, quartzite and sandstone and shale.  The climate is warm and arid with mean annual temperature of 47 to 51 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  Mean summer temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F.  Freeze-free period is 90 to 150 days."
