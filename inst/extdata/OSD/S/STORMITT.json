  "OVERVIEW": "The Stormitt series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale sandstone, diorite, limestone, and quartzite.  These soils are on alluvial fans, benches, stream terraces, and hillsides.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  Average annual precipitation is 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F.",
