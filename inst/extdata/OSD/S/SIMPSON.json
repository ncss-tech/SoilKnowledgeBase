  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Simpson soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in volcanic ashand alluvium superimposed over very gravelly ashy sandy lacustrine material, both of which were derived mainly from tuffs, basalts and andesites. Elevations range from 1,280 to 1,542 meters (4,200 to 5,060 feet). The climate is cool, continental with mean annual precipitation of 305 to 406 millimeters (12 to 16 inches), most of which comes in the form of snow. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.5 to 11.0 degrees C. (46 to 52 degrees F.); frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."
