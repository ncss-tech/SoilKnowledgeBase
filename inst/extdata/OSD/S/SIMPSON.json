  "OVERVIEW": "Simpson series consists of very deep, well drained soils on fan remnants. These soils formed in volcanic ashand alluvium superimposed lacustrine material, both of which were derived mainly from tuffs, basalts and andesites. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 356 millimeters (14 inches), most of which comes in the form of snow. The mean annual air temperature is about 9.0 degrees C. (48 degrees F.).",
