  "REVDATE": "05/2000",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Stargulch series consists of very deep, well drained soils that have a high component of volcanic ash in the surface layers and formed in glaciofluvial deposits or alluvium. These soils are on stream terraces in valleys. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
