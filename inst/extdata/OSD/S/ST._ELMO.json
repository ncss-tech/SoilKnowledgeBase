  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The St. Elmo soils typically are calcareous throughout but depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 4 inches in virgin areas.  Depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 7 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15inches.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent in a major part of the control section.  The control section is a very gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly sand and surface soils having texture finer than loamy fine sand should not be thicker than 12 inches.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 85 percent by volume and are typically less than 3 inches in diameter but range up to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from mildly to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  It ranges from moderately to very strongly alkaline and has 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The St. Elmo soils are on alluvial fans and valley side slopes.  Slope gradients typically range from 2 to about 12 percent.  The soils formed in alluvial parent materials derived from mixed sources but are usually strongly influenced by sedimentary rock.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 12 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  The mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 61 degrees F."
