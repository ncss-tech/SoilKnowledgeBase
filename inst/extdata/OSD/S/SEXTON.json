  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: With the update of 03/2005, the location of the typical pedon was moved from Edwards County, Illinois to Edgar County, Illinois, the classification was changed to reflect endo-saturation rather than epi-saturation, and the great group was changed from Chromic Vertic to Typic because the LEP for these soils is less than required for soils in the Vertic great group. The pedon at the new location better fits the concept of a non-vertic soil with endo saturation.\nA commonly flooded phase of Sexton is presently recognized. This phase will be evaluated during MLRA update to determine if new series is needed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 12 inches (0 to 30 cm) (Ap and Eg horizons);\nalbic horizon - the zone from 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 cm) (Eg horizon);\nargillic horizon - the zone from approximately 12 to 45 inches (30 to 114 cm)(Btg part of Btg/Eg, Btg1, Btg2, and 2BCtg horizons);\naquic conditions - redoximorphic features in all horizons below 8 inches;"
