Elbert soils have a lithic or paralithic contact within a depth of 60 inches. Kampville, Traer and Weir soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity in the upper 55 inches of the series control section."

Mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 45 inches (813 to 1143 mm); frost free period ranges from 160 to 200 days; and elevation ranges from 340 to 1020 feet (104 to 311 meters) above sea level."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to low (0.01 to 1.41 micrometers per second). Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or moderately low (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers per second).  Permeability is slow. A seasonal high water table is within a depth of 1 foot at some time between January and June in normal years. Flooding is typically none or rare, however, a commonly flooded phase is recognized (see remarks)."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: With the update of 03/2005, the location of the typical pedon was moved from Edwards County, Illinois to Edgar County, Illinois, the classification was changed to reflect endo-saturation rather than epi-saturation, and the great group was changed from Chromic Vertic to Typic because the LEP for these soils is less than required for soils in the Vertic great group. The pedon at the new location better fits the concept of a non-vertic soil with endo saturation.\nA commonly flooded phase of Sexton is presently recognized. This phase will be evaluated during MLRA update to determine if new series is needed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 12 inches (0 to 30 cm) (Ap and Eg horizons);\nalbic horizon - the zone from 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 cm) (Eg horizon);\nargillic horizon - the zone from approximately 12 to 45 inches (30 to 114 cm)(Btg part of Btg/Eg, Btg1, Btg2, and 2BCtg horizons);\naquic conditions - redoximorphic features in all horizons below 8 inches;\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
