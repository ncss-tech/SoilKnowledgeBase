  "OVERVIEW": "The Saleratus series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium from mixed parent materials.  These soils are on floorplains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
