  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Snotown soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on concave, north to southeast facing upper backslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from shale and other sedimentary rocks.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,955 to 2,380 meters.  The climate is cold, continental with additional moisture derived from drifting snow accumulation in the area.  The mean annual precipitation is 380 cm to 500 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."
