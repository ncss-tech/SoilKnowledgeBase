    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Saipan soils are on uplifted limestone plateaus that are often tilted and dissected. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Elevation ranges from 30 to 1,300 feet. These soils formed in sediments that are a mixture of alluvium, residuum, and volcanic ash which overlie porous coralline limestone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 80 to 100 inches, most of which falls between June and November.  Mean annual temperature is 78 degrees F., with less than 4 degrees F.  difference between summer and winter."
