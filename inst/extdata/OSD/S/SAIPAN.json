  "OVERVIEW": "The Saipan series consists of deep and very deep, moderately permeable, well drained soils. They are on uplifted limestone plateaus and formed in sediments overlying porous coralline limestone. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 85 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 78 degrees F.",
