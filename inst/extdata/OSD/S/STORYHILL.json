  "OVERVIEW": "The Storyhill series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium.  These soils are on relict stream terraces and hills.  Slopes are 4 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
