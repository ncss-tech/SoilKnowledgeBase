  "OVERVIEW": "The Strike series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderate permeability that formed in loess and weathered volcanic ash over coarse-loamy alluvium from basalt and weathered volcanic ash. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent on plains. The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the average annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
