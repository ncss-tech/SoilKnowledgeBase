Driest during May and June.  Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.\nSoil temperature: 62 to 69 degrees F.\nRock fragments: more than 35 percent, but can range from 0 to 85 gravel/petronodes percent in any horizon\nPetronodic feature: 20 to 50 percent petronodes.  Thought to have formed from calcium and magnesium that precipitated out during fluctuating seasonal water tables under a climate much wetter than the present.  Repeated wetting and extreme drying of the soil may have been a factor in nodule development.  The petronodes have no internal organization and break down completely in HCL acid but not in water.\nReaction: slightly or moderately alkaline\nClay content: 18 to 35 percent in control section\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 5 percent in the upper horizons and greater than 15 percent in the lower horizons\nDepth to calcic horizon: 30 to 50 inches\nA horizon\nHue:  7.5YR, 5YR\nValue:  3 or 4, dry or moist\nChroma:  4 or 6, dry or moist\nTexture: fine sandy loam, sandy loam\nBt and Btc horizons\nHue:  2.5YR, 5YR\nValue:  3 through 5, dry or moist\nChroma:  4 or 6, dry or moist\nTexture: sandy clay loam, sandy loam\nBkc horizon\nHue:  5YR, 2.5YR\nValue:  4, 7 or 8 dry, 3 through 5 moist\nChroma:  2 through 6, dry or moist\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: greater than 15 percent with some 3rd and 4th stage cementation"

The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December to February.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 230 days."
