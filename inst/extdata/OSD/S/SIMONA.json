Cave soils are in the Sonoran Desert (MLRA 40) have a moisture regime with almost equal (bi-modal) summer-winter distribution of precipitation.  Goodsprings, Irongold, and Vace soils are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30) receive mostly winter precipitation and are usually dry from April through November."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Simona soils are on nearly level to moderately undulating plains and tops of mesa and low ridges at elevations of 2,750 to 5,000 feet.  Relief is generally low.  Drainage is typically depressional \"pot holes\", intermittent ponds or elongated swales but some areas are dissected by shallow drainageways that form low ridges where the Simona soils occur on the ridge tops.  The soils formed in calcareous sandy sediments over fractured indurated caliche that grades to softer caliche material below.  It has been considerably modified in its upper part by recent environmental factors.  The climate is arid to semiarid continental. The average annual temperature ranges from about 58 to 70 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to about 14 inches with a marked late summer maximum.  The Thornthwaite P-E Index ranges from about 14 to 30. The frost free period is 180 to 230 days."

Berino soils are in depressional areas and have argillic horizons.  Bigetty soils are in the depressions and have mollic epipedons.  Cacique soils have argillic and petrocalcic horizons. Pajarito and Pintura soils are on plains and fans and lack petrocalcic horizons.  Tencee and Upton soils have carbonatic mineralogy.  Tonuco soils are sandy."
