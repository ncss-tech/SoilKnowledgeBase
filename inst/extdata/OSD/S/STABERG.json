  "OVERVIEW": "The Staberg series consists of moderately deep, well drained  soils that formed in colluvium, and residuum from tuffaceous shale on hillsides and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
