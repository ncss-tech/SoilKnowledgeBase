  "OVERVIEW": "The Saruche series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and slope alluvium derived dominantly from shale on mountain slopes and hills. Slopes range from 10 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F.",

(Cr horizon)\nRemarks:\nThese soils were previously thought to be skeletal, but further investigations determined most of the coarse fragments to be residual shale fragments. Laboratory data indicates mixed mineralogy to replace smectitic mineralogy with this update. Laboratory pedon #93CO071010.\nTaxonomic Version:  Tenth Edition, 2006"
