  "OVERVIEW": "The Sodacreek series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in colluvium and landslide material from mica schist mixed with volcanic ash.  Sodacreek soils are on mountainsides and in valleys.  Slopes are 25 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 80 inches and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Rock fragments in the particle-size control section average from 35 to 60 percent.  Depth to the 2C horizon ranges from 14 to 30 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has dry value of 6 or 7, moist of 4 to 6.  Chroma is 1 or 2 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and moist.

These soils formed in colluvium and landslide material from weathered mica schist mixed with volcanic ash.  They are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 75 to 85 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 62 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 23 degrees F, mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an albic horizon from mineral surface to 1/4 inches, a cambic horizon from 1/4 to 20 inches, and a lithologic change at 20 inches. The soil above 20 inches has a component of volcanic ash and below is mostly colluvium from mica schist. This description reflects a change in classification due to Andisols order from loamy-skeletal, micaceous, Typic Cryochrepts to medial over loamy-skeletal, micaceous, Typic Vitricryands."
