Rock fragments in the particle-size control section average from 35 to 60 percent.  Depth to the 2C horizon ranges from 14 to 30 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has dry value of 6 or 7, moist of 4 to 6.  Chroma is 1 or 2 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and moist.  Texture is gravelly fine sandy loam, bouldery fine sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4 dry or moist.

These soils formed in colluvium and landslide material from weathered mica schist mixed with volcanic ash.  They are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 75 to 85 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 62 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 23 degrees F, mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. Growing season at 28 degrees F is 120 to 155 days."

The soil above 20 inches has a component of volcanic ash and below is mostly colluvium from mica schist.
