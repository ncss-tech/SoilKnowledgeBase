  "STATES": "SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Strayhoss series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy eolian material over sandy eolian material on uplands.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and rapid in the sandy material.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches.",

In some counties this soil has been correlated as the Flandreau series."
