Thickness of mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 16 inches and extends into the Bw horizon. The upper part of the series control section averages between 18 and 30 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  The lower part of the series control section contains more than 70 percent sand and less than 15 percent clay. Some pedons have loamy glacial till below a depth of 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 (2 or 3 moist), and chroma of 1 or 2.   It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 4 to 6 (3 or 4 moist), and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or silt loam.   It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bk horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 4 to 6 (3 to 5 moist) and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.   It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Some pedons have a 2Bk horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 5 to 7 (4 to 6 moist), and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand or fine sand.  Fine strata of silt loam, loam and sandy loam are in some pedons.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Some pedons have a 3C horizon."

Maddock soils have a sandy particle size control section.  They are on shoulders above the Strayhoss soils. Estelline soils have thicker mollic epipedons and contain coarse more than 15 percent coarse fragments in the 2C horizon.  They are on adjacent outwash plains. Kranzburg and Poinsett soils do not have sandy material within a depth of 40 inches and are on similar landscapes."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 13 inches (Ap and Bw1 horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from about 13 inches to a depth of about 30 inches (Bw2 and Bw3 horizons). In some counties this soil has been correlated as the Flandreau series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
