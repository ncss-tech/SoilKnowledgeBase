    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 16 inches thick. The combined thickness of the Al, A2 and B2t horizons is 60 to more than 75 inches. There is an abrupt texture change between the A2 horizon and the B2t horizon at depths of 24 to 45 inches. Clay content increases more than 20 percent within a vertical distance of less than 3 inches. Rock fragments are mainly cobble and stone size angular sandstone and rounded quartzite rock fragments ranging from about 5 to 20 percent in the Al horizons, 30 to 70 percent in the A2 horizon, and 35 to 70 percent in the upper part of the B2t horizon, 70 to 90 percent in the lower part of the B2t horizon. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of about 20 inches ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F. The soils are moist for 55 to 65 percent of the time and are dry in parts of the 4 to 12 inch depth for 60 to 75 days during the late summer or early autumn.\nThe Al horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It has weak to moderate, fine to medium granular structure or weak subangular blocky structure in the lower part. This horizon ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It ranges from cobbly loam or very cobbly loam to gravelly fine sandy loam. This horizon has weak to moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky structure. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 8. It is very cobbly or very gravelly clay or very cobbly heavy clay loam with more than 35 percent clay. This horizon has weak to strong, medium to coarse prismatic structure that parts to blocky structure. It ranges from medium acid to neutral. It has few to continuous, thin or moderately thick clay films on peds and in pores."

Parent rocks are dominantly sandstone with some quartzite, limestone and shale. The climate is moist subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters. The average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 35 inches. The mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45F. The mean summer temperature is 54 to 58 degrees F. The frost free period is 80 to 100 days."
