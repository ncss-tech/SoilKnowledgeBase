  "OVERVIEW": "The Scave series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and/or colluvium derived mainly from sandstone with some quartzite, limestone and shale. These soils are on moderately steep to very steep mountain slopes. Slopes are 6 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
