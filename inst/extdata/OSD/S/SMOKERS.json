  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Smokers soils are usually moist at a depth from 10 centimeters (4 inches) to the paralithic contact (moisture control section) but are dry in all parts for 45 to 70 consecutive days in the 4 months following the summer solstice in most years.  The mean annual soil temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C. (43 to 47 degrees F).  Depth to the paralithic contact is 10 to 25 centimeters (4 to 10 inches) and the depth to the lithic contact is from 25 to 51 centimeters (10 to 20 inches).  Hue throughout the profile is 10YR or 7.5YR.  Gravel tends to be subrounded and many of the surface gravel have a coat of a reddish brown desert polish.  The gravel consists of quartz, agate, jasper and other rocks.  The solum averages 25 to 35 percent clay.  Soil reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It is gravelly ashy loam with 18 to 27 percent clay.  It has 5 to 15 percent glass and acid oxalate extractable plus one-half the iron is 0.3 to 0.5 percent.  It has 15 to 35 percent gravel.  It has 1 to 2 percent organic matter.\nThe 2BAt horizon, when present, has colors, rock fragments, and texture similar to the 2Bt horizon.  It has 1 to 2 percent organic matter.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is clay loam with 27 to 40 percent clay.  It has 10 to 35 percent gravel."

The mean annual precipitation is 355 to 457 millimeters (14 to 18 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 5.0 to 7.2 degrees C. (41 to 45 degrees F).  The frost-free period is 30 to 100 days."

Bocker soils are on intermounds and are loamy-skeletal.  Merlin soils are mounds and are shallow and clayey.  Damon and Silvies soils are in drainageways and are very deep.  Damon soils are fine-silty whereas Silvies soils are fine.  Fopiano soils are found in complex with Smokers on rolling hills.  Fopiano soils are shallow to a paralithic contact and are clayey."
