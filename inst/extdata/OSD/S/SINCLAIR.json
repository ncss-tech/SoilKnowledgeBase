The climate is marine with cool, dry summers and mild, wet winters.  The annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 50 inches and falls mostly as rain from November through March.  The mean January temperature is about 39 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 59 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.
