  "OVERVIEW": "The Sinclair series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in glacial till.  Sinclair soils are on glacial till plains and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
