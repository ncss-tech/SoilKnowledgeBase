Cottle, Hooplite, Olac, Old Camp, and Soughe soils not intermittently moist in some part of the moisture control section for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October. Gabbvally and Nevo soils do not have carbonates and are noneffervescent in the A and Bt horizons. Phliss soils have identifiable secondary carbonates at depths of 8 to 25 cm and are dry from July through October. Rowel soils have a Bt horizon with 40 to 55 percent clay. Thike soils average 12 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Stewval soils are on hills, mountains, mesas, plateaus, and pediments. They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 1,371 to 2,713 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 130 days."

Downeyville soils are loamy-skeletal, very shallow and shallow to lithic contacts, and have an aridic moisture regime that does not border on xeric. Goldyke soils are loamy, very shallow to paralithic contacts, and do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons."
