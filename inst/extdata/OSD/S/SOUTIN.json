  "OVERVIEW": "The Soutin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  Soutin soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
