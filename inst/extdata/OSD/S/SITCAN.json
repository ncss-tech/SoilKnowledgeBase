(Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nOther features:  Ustic aridic moisture regime\nThe Sitcan soils were part of the Satanta series, but have been separated based on lower soil moisture, cooler soil temperatures, and the removal of Satanta from MLRA 69.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\n10/2008 LAN WAW updated the format to include metric and updated horizon nomenclature during final correlation of Las Animas County soil survey.\nTaxonomic Version:  Second Edition, 1999\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
