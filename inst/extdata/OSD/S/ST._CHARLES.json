Dubuque, Knowles, La Farge and Marseilles soils are moderately deep to a lithic or paralithic contact. Bertrand, Jackson, Jemerson, Pepin, Seaton and Stookey soils average less than 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Blackhammer soils have rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section that are dominantly chert and sandstone. Camden, Piscasaw, Ridgway and Yellowriver soils have horizons with more than 10 percent sand above a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Dodge, Lomira, Navlys, and Sylvan soils contain carbonates above a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Fayette, Menfro, Palermo, Rozetta, Ruma and Stookey soils have less than 10 percent sand throughout the series control section. Flagg soils have at least one subhorizon of the 2Bt horizon that has hue of 5YR or redder on faces of peds or in the matrix. Greenridge soils have soil colors hues of 5Y, 5YG, 10GY, or 5G in the lower part of the series control section. These hues are associated with residuum weathered from galauconitic sandstone. Hackers soils have hues of 2.5YR or 5YR dominant in the solum and throughout the substratum. Lambeau soils have sand or fine sand in the lower part of the series control section. Martinsburg soils have E horizons that are at least 31 cm (12 inches) thick and have the layer of maximum clay content at a depth of 76 to 91 cm (30 to 36 inches). Middletown soils average more than 60 percent sand and less than 10 percent clay in the substratum. Palsgrove soils formed in loess and residuum weathered from limestone and have a lithic contact at depths of 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches). Rush soils have less than 10 percent clay and average more than 20 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Thebes soils have more than 15 percent sand in all horizons within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: St. Charles soils are on summits and side slopes of loess covered outwash plains, till plains, and stream terraces. Slopes commonly are 0 to 15 percent, but some are as steep as 30 percent. St. Charles soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess and in the underlying loamy stratified outwash or sandy loam till thought to be of Wisconsin Age. The substratum commonly is stratified loamy outwash, but in some pedons is gravelly or sandy outwash or sandy loam till. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 12.2 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches), frost-free period ranges from 160 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 207 to 311 meters (680 to 1020 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Batavia, Camden, Kendall, Kidder, McHenry, Sexton, Starks, and Thorp soils. Batavia soils have a dark-colored surface layer and commonly are upslope from St. Charles soils and farther from the drainageways. Camden soils are nearby on similar landscapes that have a mantle of loess 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) in thickness. Kendall soils are the somewhat poorly drained member of a hydro-sequence with St. Charles soils. Kidder and McHenry soils formed in sandy loam till on similar topographic positions as some St. Charles soils, but average more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser in the control section. The poorly drained Sexton and somewhat poorly drained Starks soils are on outwash plains and stream terraces nearby, and have chroma of 2 in the upper part of the sola. The nearly level, poorly drained Thorp soils have a thinner mantle of loess and are Argiaquic Argialbolls."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. An apparent water table is at a depth of 107 to 183 cm (3.5 to 6 feet) at some time between February and June, or at depths greater than 183 cm (6 feet). The potential for surface runoff is very low on areas of less than 5 percent slopes and low on areas of 5 to 20 percent slopes. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometer per second). The areas of St. Charles series mapped as sandy and gravelly substratum phases have saturated hydraulic conductivity in the substratum as high to very high (42.34 or more micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate in the solum. The permeability is moderate in the 2C horizon of soils with loamy substratum, rapid in the 2C horizon of soils in the sandy substratum phase, and very rapid in the 2C horizon of soils in the gravelly substratum phase."

    "content": "REMARKS: The areas of St. Charles soils mapped as sandy substratum phase and gravelly substratum phase are being evaluated during MLRA update activities to determine if new series are needed. A moderately wet phase with a 107 to 183 cm (3.5 to 6.0 feet) seasonal water table may also be identified in future MLRA updates.\nAlso, those areas of St. Charles soils that formed in loess and sandy loam till are being evaluated as part of the MLRA 95B update. A new series will be proposed for those soils.\nThe areas of these soils mapped in \"cool mesic\" and in \"warm mesic\" will be evaluated for possible new series.\nDiagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 20 cm (8 inches) (Ap horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 20 to 112 cm (8 to 44 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
