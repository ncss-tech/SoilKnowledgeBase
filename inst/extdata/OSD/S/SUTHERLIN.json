  "OVERVIEW": "The Sutherlin series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium over residuum weathered from sandstone and siltstone.  Sutherlin soils are on foot slopes, hill slopes and drainageways and have slopes of 3 to 60 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is about 45 inches.",

The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F.  The base saturation is less than 75 percent in some part of the argillic horizon.  Depth to a paralithic contact commonly is greater than 60 inches but in some pedons it is as shallow as 40 inches.  Depth to the clayey lithologic discontinuity is 24 to 36 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam and averages 27 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  There is a stone line at the base of this horizon in some pedons.  Clean sand and silt coatings are common in the upper B horizon in some pedons.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe 2BC and 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and 4 through 6 dry.  It is massive or has weak coarse prismatic structure.  Slickensides are common in some pedons.  It is silty clay or clay and averages 55 to 65 percent clay. Coarse fragments in the upper part range from 0 to 15 percent and 0 to 25 percent in the lower part.  The fragments commonly are weathered and can be crushed."
