  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist, but is dry throughout the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F.  The base saturation is less than 75 percent in some part of the argillic horizon.  Depth to a paralithic contact commonly is greater than 60 inches but in some pedons it is as shallow as 40 inches.  Depth to the clayey lithologic discontinuity is 24 to 36 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam and averages 27 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  There is a stone line at the base of this horizon in some pedons.  Clean sand and silt coatings are common in the upper B horizon in some pedons.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe 2BC and 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and 4 through 6 dry.  It is massive or has weak coarse prismatic structure.  Slickensides are common in some pedons.  It is silty clay or clay and averages 55 to 65 percent clay. Coarse fragments in the upper part range from 0 to 15 percent and 0 to 25 percent in the lower part.  The fragments commonly are weathered and can be crushed."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Selmac series in the same family and the Hazelair and Yoncalla series.  Hazelair soils have a mollic epipedon and lack an argillic horizon.  Yoncalla soils are somewhat poorly drained and have mottles with chroma of 2 or less at depths of 24 inches or less and are 14 to 24 inches deep to nonconforming clay IIC horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sutherlin soils are on broadly convex foot slopes and moderately steep hill slopes.  Elevations are 300 to 2,000 feet.  Slopes are 3 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium and colluvium that is loamy in the upper part and clayey in the lower part.  The origin fine clayey material is probably depositional but exact origin is unknown.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches.  The frost-free season is 160 to 235 days."
