    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Amelar, Broad, Custco, Drage, Rawnjay, Remount, Scalfar, Searla, Small (T), and Swampydraw (T) series.\nAmelar, Custco, Drage, Rawnjay, Remount, Scalfar, Searla, and Swampydraw soils are very deep.  Broad soils have calcic horizons and generally have secondary carbonates that are deeper than 23 inches from the soil surface.  Small soils have calcic horizons and have rock fragments that are rhyolite."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sheep Creek soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on south, west, or east-facing backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from calcareous sandstone, limestone, or quartzite.  Slopes are 5 to 70 percent.  Elevations range from 5,500 to 7,450 feet.  The climate is moist subhumid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 24 inches, the mean annual temperature is 39 to 44 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 70 to 110 days."
