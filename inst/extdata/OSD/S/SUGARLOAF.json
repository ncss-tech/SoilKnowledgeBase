  "OVERVIEW": "The Sugarloaf series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that were formed in alluvium, colluvium and lacustrine deposits derived mainly from basic igneous and sedimentary rocks.  These soils occur on gently sloping to steep lake terraces and stream terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 30 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 9 inches.",
