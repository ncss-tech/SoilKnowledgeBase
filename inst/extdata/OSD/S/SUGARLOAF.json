The soils formed in alluvium, colluvium and lacustrine deposits derived mainly from basic igneous and sedimentary rocks. The climate is arid, the mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F., the mean summer temperature ranges from 70 to 73 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days. Average annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches."
