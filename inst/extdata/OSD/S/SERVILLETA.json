Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  This horizon usually has granular structure but some pedons are platy.  It is soft or slightly hard.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is heavy silty clay loam or light clay. This horizon has moderate medium subangular blocky or weak medium prismatic structure.  It is hard or very hard.  The reaction ranges from neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR.  It is moderately or strongly calcareous and moderately or strongly alkaline.  Carbonates are disseminated or segregated into soft masses and filaments."

Arp, Baca, Hesper, Manzanola, Mughouse, Panky, Recluse, Rencalson, Renohill, Ulm and Wyarno soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Arnhart, Aso, Bessemer, Carlito, Cerrillos, Lonti, Malposa, Poley, Quackenbush and Silver soils lack a lithic contact within 40 inches of the surface.  Norrest soils have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y in the B2t horizon.  Tobish soils contain 20 to 40 percent rock fragments in the B2t horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Servilleta soils are on gently sloping basalt flows.  Slopes are usually 1 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in loess and residuum weathered from basalt.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 13 inches with peak periods of precipitation in July and August.  The mean annual air temperature is about 46 to 50 degrees F.  Elevations range from about 6,000 to 8,000 feet.  The frost free season ranges from 125 to 140 days."
