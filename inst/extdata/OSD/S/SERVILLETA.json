  "OVERVIEW": "The Servilleta series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and material weathered from basalt.  Servilleta soils are on basalt flows and have slopes of 1 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  This horizon usually has granular structure but some pedons are platy.  It is soft or slightly hard.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is heavy silty clay loam or light clay. This horizon has moderate medium subangular blocky or weak medium prismatic structure.  It is hard or very hard.  The reaction ranges from neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR.  It is moderately or strongly calcareous and moderately or strongly alkaline.  Carbonates are disseminated or segregated into soft masses and filaments."

Arp, Baca, Hesper, Manzanola, Mughouse, Panky, Recluse, Rencalson, Renohill, Ulm and Wyarno soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Arnhart, Aso, Bessemer, Carlito, Cerrillos, Lonti, Malposa, Poley, Quackenbush and Silver soils lack a lithic contact within 40 inches of the surface.  Norrest soils have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y in the B2t horizon.  Tobish soils contain 20 to 40 percent rock fragments in the B2t horizon."
