They formed in sandy marine sediments.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 55 inches and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 73 to 75 degrees F."

With the exception of Orlando and Placid soils, these soils do not have umbric epipedons.  Adamsville soils are on higher positions.  The poorly or very poorly drained Myakka, Ona, and Smyrna soils are on similar to lower positions and are Spodosols.  The well drained Orlando soils are on higher positions.  The very poorly drained Placid and Pompano soils are in adjacent lower depressions.  Zolfo soils are on slightly higher positions and are Spodosols."

The natural vegetation consists of longleaf pine, laurel oak, and water oak with an understory of sawpalmetto, pineland threeawn, indiangrass, bluestem grasses, and several low panicums."
