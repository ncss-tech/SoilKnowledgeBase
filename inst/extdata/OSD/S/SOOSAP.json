    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist but is dry for less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches during the summer months.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is less than 47 degrees F. with an O horizon and in full shade.  Depth to soft bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 20 percent in the particle-size control section.  The fine-earth fraction of the particle-size control section contains greater than 85 percent phosphate retention, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of more than 2.0 percent, and 15 to 30 percent 15-bar moisture based on an air-dried sample.  Moist bulk density is 0.80 to 0.90 grams per cubic centimeter. It is very strongly acid or strongly acid.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.  The apparent clay content is 10 to 18 percent.\nThe A horizon has value 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It is gravelly loam with 10 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is loam, silt loam, or cobbly loam with 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe Cr horizon has color similar to the Bw horizon."

The soils formed in colluvium weathered from tuffs, breccias, and andesite mixed with volcanic ash. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and cool moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 65 to 100 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 30 to 90 days."
