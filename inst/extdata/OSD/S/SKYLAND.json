Cohila soils have a mean annual precipitation of 546 millimeters (22 inches), a mean annual air temperature of 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.) and are formed in alluvium from granitic material. Indleton soils have a particle-size control section with 18 to 25 percent clay and are formed from metasedimentary material. Itat soils are formed from basalt with an influence from loess and old alluvium, allow hues of 2.5YR and 5YR in the control section and have mean annual precipitation of 584 millimeters (23 inches). Pardaloe soils have mean annual precipitation of 1,524 millimeters (60 inches) and are formed from sandstone, siltstone or shale.
