Brownbear, Caris and Maki soils have a lithic contact within 100 centimeters (40 inches). Brownbear and Caris soils are formed from sedimentary, metavolcanic or volcanic rock. In addition, Brownbear and Caris soils have a particle-size control section with 20 to 30 percent clay and 18 to 30 percent clay, respectively; and Maki soils have a mean annual precipitation of 508 millimeters (20 inches), a mean annual air temperature of 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.) and are formed from calcareous rock and glacial till influenced by loess and volcanic ash. Burwill soils have a mean annual precipitation of 813 millimeters (32 inches), a mean annual air temperature of 8 degrees C. (46 degrees F.), are formed from rhyolite, tuff and basalt and have a particle-size control section with 20 to 27 percent clay. Cohila soils have a mean annual precipitation of 546 millimeters (22 inches), a mean annual air temperature of 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.) and are formed in alluvium from granitic material. Indleton soils have a particle-size control section with 18 to 25 percent clay and are formed from metasedimentary material. Itat soils are formed from basalt with an influence from loess and old alluvium, allow hues of 2.5YR and 5YR in the control section and have mean annual precipitation of 584 millimeters (23 inches). Pardaloe soils have mean annual precipitation of 1,524 millimeters (60 inches) and are formed from sandstone, siltstone or shale.  Rockyglen soils have more than 1525 millimeters (60 inches) of annual precipitation and are over 152 centimeters (60 inches) to bedrock."
