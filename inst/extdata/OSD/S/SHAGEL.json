  "OVERVIEW": "The Shagel series consists of shallow well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from rhyolite. Shagel soils are on mountains and foothills. Permeability is moderate and slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
