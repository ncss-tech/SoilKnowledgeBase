  "OVERVIEW": "The Sevier series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils on benches and toeslopes.  They formed in colluvium and residuum from shale and thin-bedded sandstone.  Slopes range from 5 to 25 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

Rock fragments average less than 35 percent in the solum.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 38 to 44 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature at the paralithic contact is about 54 to 58 degrees F.  The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry.  It is calcareous.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It ranges from sandy clay loam and clay loam to cobbly and gravelly clay loam; clay content (estimated) averages 35 to 42 percent.  The Bt horizons are noncalcareous to strongly calcareous.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4."
