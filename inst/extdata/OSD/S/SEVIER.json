Rock fragments average less than 35 percent in the solum.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 38 to 44 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature at the paralithic contact is about 54 to 58 degrees F.  The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry.  It is calcareous.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It ranges from sandy clay loam and clay loam to cobbly and gravelly clay loam; clay content (estimated) averages 35 to 42 percent.  The Bt horizons are noncalcareous to strongly calcareous.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4."

They formed in colluvium and residuum from shale and thin-bedded sandstones.  Elevations range from 7,800 to 8,500 feet.  Slope gradients are 5 to 25 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches and the freeze-free period ranges from 60 to 70 days.  The mean annual temperature is 36 to 42 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is 54 to 58 degrees F."
