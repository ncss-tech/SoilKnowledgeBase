  "OVERVIEW": "The Strandline series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a mantle of ash-influenced loess overlying firm glacial till.  Strandline soils are on moraines and mountain footslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 26 inches.",

The exchange complex of the sola is dominated by amorphous material.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon, when present, has hue from 5YR to 10YR; value moist of 2 or 3 and chroma moist of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue from 5YR to 10YR; value moist from 4 to 6; and chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue from 2.5YR to 10YR; value moist of 2 or 3; and chroma moist from 1 to 4.\nThe Bs horizons have hue from 2.5YR to 10YR; value moist from 4 to 6; and chroma moist from 3 to 6.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe buried solum is similar in color and texture to the surface solum.\nC horizons are present below the buried solum in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon is massive, firm, loam or silt loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent with 5 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobble."
