  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The pedons have a bisequal sola.  The combined sola ranges from 14 to 30 inches.  The upper 4 inches of the spodic horizons have less than 6 percent organic carbon.  The loess mantle ranges from 20 to 37 inches in thickness over the firm, glacial till substratum.  The exchange complex of the sola is dominated by amorphous material.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon, when present, has hue from 5YR to 10YR; value moist of 2 or 3 and chroma moist of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue from 5YR to 10YR; value moist from 4 to 6; and chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue from 2.5YR to 10YR; value moist of 2 or 3; and chroma moist from 1 to 4.\nThe Bs horizons have hue from 2.5YR to 10YR; value moist from 4 to 6; and chroma moist from 3 to 6.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe buried solum is similar in color and texture to the surface solum.\nC horizons are present below the buried solum in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon is massive, firm, loam or silt loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent with 5 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobble."

Boulder Point, Darling, Flat Horn, Tuomi(T), and Whitsol soils have loose or friable substratums.  Cohoe soils have stratas of sand and sandy loam in the control section.  Kenai soils have greater than 18 percent clay in the substratum.  Swanson soils are not bisequal.  Kroto soils have loess mantles thinner than 20 inches overlying glacial till.  Chuit and Puntilla soils have more than 6 percent organic carbon in the upper part of the spodic horizon.  Chulitna, Kashwitna, and Nancy soils are sandy or sandy-skeletal in the lower part of the control section."

The soils formed in a mantle of loess overlying massive, firm, glacial till.  The loess mantle contains varying amounts of volcanic ash.  Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 34 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 32 to 36 degrees F."
