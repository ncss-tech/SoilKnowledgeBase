  "OVERVIEW": "The Strandline series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a mantle of ash-influenced loess overlying firm glacial till.  Strandline soils are on moraines and mountain footslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 26 inches.",

The upper 4 inches of the spodic horizons have less than 6 percent organic carbon.  The loess mantle ranges from 20 to 37 inches in thickness over the firm, glacial till substratum.  The exchange complex of the sola is dominated by amorphous material.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon, when present, has hue from 5YR to 10YR; value moist of 2 or 3 and chroma moist of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue from 5YR to 10YR; value moist from 4 to 6; and chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue from 2.5YR to 10YR; value moist of 2 or 3; and chroma moist from 1 to 4.\nThe Bs horizons have hue from 2.5YR to 10YR; value moist from 4 to 6; and chroma moist from 3 to 6.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe buried solum is similar in color and texture to the surface solum.\nC horizons are present below the buried solum in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon is massive, firm, loam or silt loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent with 5 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobble."

Boulder Point, Darling, Flat Horn, Tuomi(T), and Whitsol soils have loose or friable substratums.  Cohoe soils have stratas of sand and sandy loam in the control section.  Kenai soils have greater than 18 percent clay in the substratum.  Swanson soils are not bisequal.  Kroto soils have loess mantles thinner than 20 inches overlying glacial till.  Chuit and Puntilla soils have more than 6 percent organic carbon in the upper part of the spodic horizon.  Chulitna, Kashwitna, and Nancy soils are sandy or sandy-skeletal in the lower part of the control section."
