  "OVERVIEW": "The Spool series is very shallow and shallow and excessively drained.  It formed in residuum, local alluvium, and eolian deposits.  Spool soils occur on gently sloping to steep bedrock controlled uplands.  Slopes are 6 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Content of gravel or channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 47 degrees F.  The mean annual summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 64 degrees F.  The particle size control section is loamy sand, sand, or fine sand.\nThe A and C horizons have hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Reactions are neutral or mildly alkaline."
