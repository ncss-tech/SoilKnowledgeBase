Content of gravel or channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 47 degrees F.  The mean annual summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 64 degrees F.  The particle size control section is loamy sand, sand, or fine sand.\nThe A and C horizons have hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Reactions are neutral or mildly alkaline."
