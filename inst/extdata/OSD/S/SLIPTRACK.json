  "OVERVIEW": "The Sliptrack series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from basalt. Sliptrack soils are on lava plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
