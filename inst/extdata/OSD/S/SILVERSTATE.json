  "OVERVIEW": "The Silverstate series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium and derived from mixed sources.  Silverstate soils are on stream terraces, inset fans, and valley floors. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
