The soils formed in mixed gravelly alluvium and colluvium from pyroclastics, basalt, sandstone, sandy shale, limestone, and granite.  The climate is continental.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches, occurring as summer thunderstorms and winter rain and snow.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 180 days."
