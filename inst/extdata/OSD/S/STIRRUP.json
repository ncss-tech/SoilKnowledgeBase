  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Stirrup soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 5 to 85 percent. These soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with colluvium from andesite.and in some areas, sandstone.  Elevation is 2,700 to 4,700 feet. The climate is characterized by cool dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 65 to 100 inches. The average January temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 59 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 37 to 43 degrees F. The growing season at 28 degrees F is 130 to 170 days.  The frost-free season is 35 to 80 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nAlbic horizon - the zone from 1 to 4 inches (E horizon)\nSpodic horizon - the zone from 4 to 14 inches (Bhs and Bs horizon)\nAndic properties - the zone from 1 to 36 inches\nParticle-size control section - from 11 to 41 inches with the zone from 11 to 36 inches qualifying as medial-skeletal and the zone from 36 to 41 inches qualifying as loamy-skeletal.  This pedon would classify as a medial-skeletal over loamy-skeletal family if such a contrasting particle-size class were in Soil Taxonomy.  Some pedons may range to fragmental in the lower part of the particle-size control section however do not meet a contrasting particle-size class due to the lack of a 35 percent or more absolute rock fragment increase over the medial-skeletal layer above.\nDepths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Partial laboratory data are available for this pedon. Soil survey sample #s S80WA-037-006; NSSL, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
