  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nAlbic horizon - the zone from 1 to 4 inches (E horizon)\nSpodic horizon - the zone from 4 to 14 inches (Bhs and Bs horizon)\nAndic properties - the zone from 1 to 36 inches\nParticle-size control section - from 11 to 41 inches with the zone from 11 to 36 inches qualifying as medial-skeletal and the zone from 36 to 41 inches qualifying as loamy-skeletal.  This pedon would classify as a medial-skeletal over loamy-skeletal family if such a contrasting particle-size class were in Soil Taxonomy.  Some pedons may range to fragmental in the lower part of the particle-size control section however do not meet a contrasting particle-size class due to the lack of a 35 percent or more absolute rock fragment increase over the medial-skeletal layer above.\nDepths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Partial laboratory data are available for this pedon.
