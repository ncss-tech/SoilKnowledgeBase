Clay content of the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon ranges from 35 to 45 percent.  Redoximorphic features are considered lithochromic and/or relic.  They do not appear to be related to the present moisture conditions in the soil.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 7, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is clay, sandy clay, or clay loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid  to moderately acid.\nThe lower and middle part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redox concentrations range from few to many in shades of red, yellow, or brown.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Cr horizon is weakly to strongly cemented tuffaceous sandstone or siltstone that is interbedded with shale. Fractures are spaced 1 to 3 feet apart, and roots are restricted to the fractures."
