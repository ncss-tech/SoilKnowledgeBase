    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the combined A and E horizons ranges from 10 to 18 inches.  Clay content of the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon ranges from 35 to 45 percent.  Redoximorphic features are considered lithochromic and/or relic.  They do not appear to be related to the present moisture conditions in the soil.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 7, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is clay, sandy clay, or clay loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid  to moderately acid.\nThe lower and middle part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redox concentrations range from few to many in shades of red, yellow, or brown.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Cr horizon is weakly to strongly cemented tuffaceous sandstone or siltstone that is interbedded with shale. Fractures are spaced 1 to 3 feet apart, and roots are restricted to the fractures."

The soils formed from tuffaceous sandstones, siltstones, mudstones and shales of the Catahoula formation and the associated Jackson Group.  The climate is warm subhumid. The mean annual temperature ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges form 35 to 40 inches.  Frost free days range from 260 to 280 days and elevation ranges from 250 to 550 feet. Thornthwaite P-E indices ranges from 50 to 68."

Burlewash, Elmina, Gomery, Koether, and Rosenwall soils are above on ridges and side slopes.  Elmina and Gomery soils have arenic epipedons.  Koether soils contain more than 35 percent coarse fragments and are on similar or slightly higher positions.   Lufkin and Oakhurst soils do not have paralithic contacts.  The Arol, Lufkin and Oakhurst soils are on lower positions."
