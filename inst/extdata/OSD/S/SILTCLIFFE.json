  "OVERVIEW": "The Siltcliffe series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in\nalluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sedimentary and igneous rocks. Siltcliffe soils are on alluvial flats and beach plains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
