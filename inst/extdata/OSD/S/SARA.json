The soils are moderately acid or strongly acid, however, base saturation by sum of cations is assumed to be 35 to 50 percent throughout the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 to 4 dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe B part of the B/E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and a chroma of 2 through 8. Texture ranges from heavy silty clay loam to silty clay, with 35 to 50 percent clay.  It is sticky and plastic or very sticky and very plastic, firm to very firm, and very hard to extremely hard."
