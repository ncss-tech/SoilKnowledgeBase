    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist and have a perched water table during the winter and early spring, but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The average annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 50 to 52 degrees F.  The soils are moderately acid or strongly acid, however, base saturation by sum of cations is assumed to be 35 to 50 percent throughout the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 to 4 dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe B part of the B/E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and a chroma of 2 through 8. Texture ranges from heavy silty clay loam to silty clay, with 35 to 50 percent clay.  It is sticky and plastic or very sticky and very plastic, firm to very firm, and very hard to extremely hard."

Bow and Coveland soils have a gravelly E horizon and have a base saturation, by sum, of more than 75 percent in some part of the argillic horizon.  Coweeman soils have a chroma of 2 or less in the matrix throughout the argillic horizon.  Hardscrabble soils have an abrupt textural change at the top of the argillic horizon.  Prather soils are mottled in the lower Bt horizon and lack a perched water table during winter and spring. Scamman soils have an ochric epipedon and base saturation (by sum) of more than 75 percent in some part of the argillic horizon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sara soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent.  Elevations range from 250 to 450 feet.  These soils formed in alluvium.  Sara soils occur in a humid marine climate having relatively cool, dry summers and mild, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation is about 45 inches.  The average January temperature is about 37 degrees F.; the average July temperature is about 64 degrees F.; and average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.   The average frost free season is about 185 days."
