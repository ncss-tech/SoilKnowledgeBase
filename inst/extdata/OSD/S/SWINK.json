    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Swink soils are on convex to plane slopes of the uplands.  Slope gradients are 0 to 30 percent.  The regolith is residuum weathered mainly from limestone.  The limestone ledges are commonly less than 15 feet thick with intervening layers of calcareous clayey shales.  Mean annual temperature is 62 degrees to 65 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index is 72 to 80."
