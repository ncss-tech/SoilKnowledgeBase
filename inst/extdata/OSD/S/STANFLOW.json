The\nmean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.\nThe soil is saturated throughout for some time of the year\nin most years.  The particle-size control section averages\n10 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent material\ncoarser than very fine sand.\nThe Akn horizons have value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry and\nchroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Chromas at 3 are only found\nin the A horizon.  SAR values are 30 or more throughout all\nhorizons.  It is very strongly alkaline.  It has EC of 16 or\nmore and decreases to 4 or less with depth.  In some pedons\nthe lower part contains up to 10 percent durinodes.\nThe 2Bkqmn horizon has color similar to the above horizons.\nSAR values range from 10 to 20.\nThe 2Bk horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry and\nchroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is typically silt loam\nbut can be loam or gravelly loam at depths of 30 inches or\nmore.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  SAR values\nrange from 2 to 10."
