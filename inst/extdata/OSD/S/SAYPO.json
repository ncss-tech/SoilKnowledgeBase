  "OVERVIEW": "The Saypo series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium.  These soils are in depressional areas on alluvial fans, stream terraces, glacial outwash plains and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
