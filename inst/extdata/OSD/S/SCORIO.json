    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the loamy underlying material ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The 10- to 40- inch particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent clay in the upper part and 7 to 18 percent clay in the underlying material.  It is stratified.  Organic matter varies widely and decreases irregularly with depth.  Some pedons contain thin Ab horizons.  Saline phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Surface horizons having value as dark as 5 dry and 3 moist do not exceed 4 inches in thickness.  The A horizon is silty clay or silty clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay or silty clay loam having 35 to 60 percent clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It has thin strata of coarser textured materials in some pedons.  Some pedons have a BCy horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy very fine sand, very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Thin strata of fine sand or loamy fine sand are common.  Redox features vary widely in amount and distinctness between pedons."

Banks and Trembles are on levees.  Banks soils are sandy.  Trembles soils are coarse-loamy."
