  "OVERVIEW": "The Scaath series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone, mudstone, and schist. Scaath soils are on mountains and have slopes of 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2290 millimeters (90 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
