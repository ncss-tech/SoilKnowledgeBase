  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Scaath soils are on strongly convex mountain slopes in highly dissected terrain and on narrow ridges. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations are 137 to 972 meters (445 to 3185 feet). The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone, mudstone, and schist. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1900 to 2550 millimeters (75 to 100 inches). Mean January temperature is about 8 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is about 220 to 290 days."

Ahpah and Wiregrass soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Rockysaddle and Wiregrass soils are more than 100 centimeters (40 inches) deep to bedrock. The Ahpah soils are on gentler slopes, softer bedrock, or higher positions than the Scaath soils. The Rockysaddle and Wiregrass soils are on straight to gently concave slopes, often below the Scaath soils."
