  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sanostee soils are on toeslopes of mesas, structural benches, and dipslopes of cuestas. They formed in eolian material, alluvium and residuum derived from Cretaceous sandstone and siltstone. Surfaces have thin local eolian deposits. Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,900 to 6,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 14 inches about half of which falls as rain from high intensity thunderstorms between July and October. The remainder falls as gentle rain or snow between December and mid-April. The mean air annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 2 to 15 inches (2Bt and 2Btk horizons)\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 15 to 24 inches (3Bk horizon)\nLithic contact - The presence of hard sedimentary bedrock at about 32 inches (3R horizon)\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006\nADDITIONAL DATA: Percent gypsum and SAR values are estimated. Salinity values were determined on three pedons, including the type location, with a Wheatstone bridge. Calcium carbonate equivalence determined with a field volume calcimeter. The type location has been sampled for determination of organic carbon and particle-size. It was reference sampled for the National Soil Survey Laboratory (NSSL) as pedon #S86NM-045-16. Samples were also analyzed at the BIA soils laboratory in Gallup, NM.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
