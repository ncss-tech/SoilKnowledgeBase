  "OVERVIEW": "The Sanostee series consists of well drained, moderately permeable soils that are moderately deep to sandstone. Sanostee soils formed in eolian material, alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and siltstone, and are on toeslopes of mesas, structural benches, and dipslopes of cuestas. Slopes are 1 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

Salinity values were determined on three pedons, including the type location, with a Wheatstone bridge. Calcium carbonate equivalence determined with a field volume calcimeter. The type location has been sampled for determination of organic carbon and particle-size. It was reference sampled for the National Soil Survey Laboratory (NSSL) as pedon #S86NM-045-16. Samples were also analyzed at the BIA soils laboratory in Gallup, NM.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
