Ymark soils are deep. Macmeal, Trapps, and Yourame soils have accumulations of calcium carbonate. Colomex soils formed in stratified alluvium and have an abrupt change to sandy textures within 40 inches. Laventana soils have albic horizons.  Mocmont soils have glossic horizons. Namon soils are deep to a lithic contact of sandstone. Sheek soils are slightly drier and have soil temperatures of 44 to 47 degrees F. Skyview and Wahatoya soils are moderately deep. Tecolote soils have an albic horizon. Towaoc soils have less than 18 percent clay. Xankey soils have lithologic discontinuities of loamy material between 24 and 40 inches and soil temperatures of 44 to 47 degrees F.  Yreka soils have mixed E/Bt horizons. In addition, Macmeal, Mocmont, Skyview, Trapps, Vision, Wahatoya, Ymark, Yourame, and Yreka soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June and occur in the Great Basin.  Vision soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sonsela soils are on backslopes of hills, buttes, and escarpments. They formed in colluvium derived from Tertiary basalt and tuff-breccia. Slopes are 35 to 70 percent. Elevation ranges from 8,200 to 9,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 24 inches with more than 50 percent falling as snow from winter storms. The mean annual temperature is 39 to 43 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 60 to 110 days."

Todacheene soils are fine-loamy, have mollic epipedons, and occur on footslopes and fan terraces.  Viewpoint soils are shallow, have mollic epipedons, and occur on adjacent shoulders. Washpass soils are coarse-loamy, have a cryic temperature regime, and occur on adjacent north-facing backslopes."
