  "OVERVIEW": "The Sonsela series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from basalt and tuff-breccia. Sonsela soils are on backslopes of hills, buttes, and escarpments. Slopes are 35 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and mean annual air temperature is 40 degrees F.",

Namon soils are deep to a lithic contact of sandstone. Sheek soils are slightly drier and have soil temperatures of 44 to 47 degrees F. Skyview and Wahatoya soils are moderately deep. Tecolote soils have an albic horizon. Towaoc soils have less than 18 percent clay. Xankey soils have lithologic discontinuities of loamy material between 24 and 40 inches and soil temperatures of 44 to 47 degrees F.  Yreka soils have mixed E/Bt horizons.
