  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  This is a cyclic soil with solum 60 to more than 80 inches thick.  In undisturbed areas there is gilgai microrelief with microknolls 4 to 12 inches higher than microdepressions.  Cycles of knolls and depressions are repeated each 4 to 23 feet.  Cracks 1 to 3 inches wide extend from the surface to a depth of more than 20 inches when the soil is dry. Slickensides begin at depths of 16 to 24 inches.  Texture is clay or silty clay throughout with 40 to 60 percent clay.  Typically the reaction is moderately alkaline and calcareous but some microdepressions are mildly alkaline and noncalcareous in the upper 12 inches.  Fragments of limestone 1 to 5 inches thick and 10 to about 40 inches across comprise 0 to 20 percent by volume in the A horizon.  Limestone fragments cover 0 to about 5 percent of the soil surface.  A few fine black concretions are throughout most pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  A horizons with 1 chroma are less than 12 inches thick or comprise less than 50 percent of the pedon.\nThe Bkss and Bk horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Mottles of these colors as well as grayish mottles range from none to a few in the Bkss horizon and from few to common in the Bk horizon.  Concretions and soft masses of calcium carbonate range from few to common.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 30 to 40 percent in the control section and ranges from 40 to 70 percent in lower layers in more than 50 percent of the pedon.\nThe C horizon has colors in shades of brown, yellow, gray or olive and is usually mottled in these colors.  It is clay, clay loam, silty clay, or shaly clay.  Concretions and soft masses of calcium carbonate range from few to common.  Some pedons have a few limestone or weakly cemented marly fragments."

Bleiblerville, Branyon, Burleson, Fairlie, Houston Black, Leson soils have moist chroma of 1 in the upper 12 inches of the A horizon.  Burleson, Dimebox, Leson, Luling, Clarita and Tamford soils are noncalcareous in the surface layer.  Clarita and Tamford soils have hue 7.5YR or redder in the subsoil.  Heiden soils contain less calcium carbonate in the substrata.  Ovan soils contain less than 30 percent calcium carbonate in the control section and are developed over clayey alluvium on flood plains.  Watonga soils have sola less than 60 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sanger soils are on erosional uplands. Slopes are mostly 1 to 5 percent but range up to 12 percent. Surfaces are convex or plain.  The soil formed in calcareous clayey marine sediments in the lower Cretaceous formations.  The climate is warm and subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 26 to 34 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 62 degrees to 69 degrees F.  Thornthwaite P-E indices ranges from 44 to 56."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the similar Slidell series and the Aledo Ponder, Purves, Medlin, San Saba and Somervell series.  San Saba soils are usually located at the heads of drains and slightly above Sanger soils.  Slidell soils are on similar or slightly lower positions.  Aledo, Bolar, Purves, and Somervell soils have sola less than 40 inches thick over limestone bedrock.  These soils are above on ridgetops or hillsides.  Ponder soils have argillic horizons and are usually above on stream divides.  Medlin soils have values of more than 3.5 throughout, and are above Sanger soils commonly on slopes along drainageways."
