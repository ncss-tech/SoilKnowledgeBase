Petrified wood fragments range from none to a few near the upper boundary of the 2B horizon.  The clay content in the fine-loamy portion of the particle-size control section averages 18 to 26 percent.  There is an absolute increase of 25 to 40 percent clay with a transition layer less than 5 inches thick between the contrasting loamy and clayey horizons.  Base saturation at a depth of 50 inches below the upper boundary of the Bt horizon typically ranges from 50 to 80 percent.  The combined thickness of the A, E, and (where present) EB horizons ranges from 6 to 19 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.

Mottles range from none to few in shades of brown or yellow.  Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid unless limed.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles range from none to common in shades of red, yellow, or brown.  Mottles with chroma of 2 or less are within a depth of 18 to 29 inches from the surface; texture is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  Coatings and interfingers of light gray to pale brown clean sand and silt range from 0 to 4 percent by volume.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid unless limed.\nThe Bt part of the Bt/E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles range from none to many in shades of red, yellow, or gray.  Texture is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  The E part of the horizon consists of coatings and interfingers of light gray to pale brown clean sand and silt ranging from 5 to 15 percent by volume. Dark concretions range from 0 to 5 percent by volume. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe 2Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles range from few to many in shades of red, yellow, or brown.  Some pedons have a mottled matrix of these colors.  In addition to the 2Btg horizon, some pedons have a 2Bt horizon that has a matrix color in shades of red, yellow, or brown with common to many grayish mottles.  The clay content ranges from 50 to 60 percent.  Some pedons have transitional layers less than 5 inches thick that are less clayey.  Small slickensides and pressure faces range from few to common. Coatings and interfingers of clean sand and silt range from none to less than 5 percent by volume.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe 2BCtg and 2Cg horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles range from few to many in shades of red, yellow, or brown.  Some pedons have a mottled matrix of these colors.  Some pedons have a 2BC or 2C horizon that has a matrix color in shades of yellow or brown with none to common gray, red, or brown mottles.  Texture is clay, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Similar series are the Freestone, Glenmora, Keithville, Kolin, Kullit, Latex, Longview, Metcalf, Porum, Raino, Sawtown, Sawyer, and Vick.  Freestone, Kullit and Latex soils lack strongly contrasting particle- size classes.  Glenmora, Keithville, Kolin, Longview, Metcalf, Sawtown, Sawyer and Vick soils have fine-silty particle-size control sections.  Porum soils have fine textured particle-size control sections.  Raino soils have tongues throughout the upper part of the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Scottsville soils are on broad nearly level to very gently sloping uplands of the Gulf Coastal Plains.  These soils occur on very gently undulating stream divides.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in thin loamy sediments and clayey deposits of the Wilcox Formation of the Tertiary period.  The climate is warm and humid. The mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 68 degrees F. The annual precipitation ranges from 44 to 54 inches.  The Thornthwaite P-E index is about 74.  Summer moisture deficit ranges from 4 to 6 inches but the normal precipitation deficiency is plus 8 inches.  The frost-free precipitation ranges from 25 to 30 inches, and frost free days range from 220 to 250."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Latex soils and the Bernaldo, Eastwood, Guyton and Metcalf soils.  Latex soils are on slightly higher oval shaped ridges and stream divides. Bernaldo soils are on slightly lower terrace positions and lack clayey 2B horizons.  Eastwood soils have red clayey Bt horizons and are on adjacent gently sloping ridges and moderately steep sideslopes along drainageways.  Guyton soils are on lower broad terrace positions and have gray subsoils.  The Metcalf soils are on slightly lower wetter positions."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Scottsville soils are moderately well drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is medium and a perched water table from a depth of 1 to 3 feet intermittently occurs from the fall to spring months."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the Scottsville soils are used for timber production and for pasture or hayland.  A few areas are used for cropland.  Native vegetation consists of loblolly pine, hickory, sweetgum and southern red oak, with mid and tall grasses such as pinehill bluestem, longleaf uniola and panicums.  American beautyberry, sumac, greenbriar and hawthorn species are part of the understory.  Improved pastures consist mainly of coastal bermudagrass or bahiagrass commonly overseeded with arrowleaf clover. Many areas are replanted to loblolly pine for maximum timber production."
