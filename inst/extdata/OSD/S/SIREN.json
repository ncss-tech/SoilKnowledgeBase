    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:   Thickness of the loamy mantle ranges from 6 to 24 inches. The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 18 to 27 percent in the upper part and is more than 35 percent in the lower part. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the surface layer and the subsurface layer unless the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part of the subsoil and from strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part of the subsoil.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 60 inches.  Content of gravel in the loamy mantle ranges from 0 to 25 percent and content of cobbles in the loamy mantle ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  The clayey lacustrine deposits contain no coarse fragments. Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less and saturation occur within the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR , value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Some pedons have an A horizon, 1 to 3 inches thick, with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR , value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture of the Ap or A horizons is silt loam (with more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser) or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR , value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam (with more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser), loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nHorizonation below the E horizon will vary depending on the thickness of the loamy mantle and the extent to which eluviation has taken place.  Therefore, there can be E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons singly or in combination\nThe E part of the E/B and the B/E horizon has colors and textures the same as the E horizon.  The Bt part of these horizons has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR , value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Typically texture is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam but is silt loam or silty clay loam (with more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser)in some pedons.\nThe 2Bt horizon typically has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture of the 2Bt horizon typically is silty clay or clay, but in some pedons it is silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Some pedons have thin lenses of coarser textured soil, in the lower part.\nSome pedons have a 2Bktg horizon with colors and textures like the 2Bt horizon except they have chroma of 1 or 2.  Carbonate accumulations are present.\nThe 2Bk horizon has color the same as the 2Bt horizon.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Thin lenses of coarser texture are in this horizon in some pedons and this horizon is varved in some pedons.  Carbonate accumulations are present.\nSome pedons have a 2C horizon.  It has the same color, texture, and properties as the 2Bk horizon, but it does not have carbonate accumulations."
