  "OVERVIEW": "The Sommeyflat series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from metamorphosed intrusive igneous rocks, mainly metagabbro and metadiorite.  Sommeyflat soils are on side slopes and ridge tops on plutons in Sierra Nevada foothills.  Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches, (1016 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F, (16 degrees C).",
