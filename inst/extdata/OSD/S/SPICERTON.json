  "OVERVIEW": "The Spicerton series consists of very deep, well to moderately well drained soils formed in fine-textured sediments derived from sedimentary rock.  These soils are on broad stream bottoms or upland drainage channels.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 38 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 42 degrees F.  and mean summer soil temperature is about 55 degrees F.  Unless eroded, these soils have thin but continuous E horizons above the natric horizon.  Thin A horizons occur above the E horizon in some pedons.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 6 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 6 to 12 inches.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary salt accumulation ranges from 5 to 10 inches, but such horizons are not strong enough to qualify as salic horizons and do not occur in all pedons.  ESP either remains constant or increases with depth ranging from 15 to 30 percent in the natric horizon but exceeds 30 percent in the Cz horizon of some pedons.  Conductivity is usually less than 4 mmhos and does not exceed 16 mmhos within the solum.  Mottling within the control section not due to the segregation of lime or other soluble salt ranges from no mottling to a few faint mottles with chroma of more than 2 in both matrix and mottles.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above 40 inches and are mainly 1/4 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to very strongly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically clay loam, silty clay loam or clay, and averages 35 to 60 percent clay, 10 to 50 percent silt, and 15 to 45 percent sand with more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  This horizon ranges from moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  It is typically loam, clay loam or clay.  This horizon ranges from moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline and has 3 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

Absher series have mean summer soil temperature greater than 59 degrees F.  Abston and Weingart soils have a paralithic contact above 40 inches.  Creed, Gerdrum and Loburn soils have lime at depths in excess of 12 inches.  Elloam soils are neutral to moderately alkaline in the Bt horizon and have vesicular crusted surface horizons.  Oburn and Thoeny soils have solums more than 12 inches thick to the base of the argillic horizon.  In addition, Oburn soils have a loamy-skeletal substratum at depths of less than 40 inches.  Thoeny soils are neutral to moderately alkaline in the Bt horizon."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Spicerton soils are on broad stream bottoms or upland drainage channels.  Slopes typically range from 0 to about 6 percent.  These soils formed in fine textured parent sediments derived principally from sedimentary rock.  At the type location, the mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 36 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 56 degrees F.  Elevations range from 7,800 to 8,300 feet.  The frost-free period is 30 to 50 days.  In Utah, mean annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  and frost-free period is 60 to 90 days at elevations of 6,200 to 7,200 feet."
