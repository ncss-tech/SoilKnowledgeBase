    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 48 to more than 60 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days during the 3-month period following the summer solstice in more than 7 years out of 10.  The argillic horizon is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay and averages 40 to 60 percent clay.  Rock fragments are 0 to 10 percent by weighted average.\nThe A or Ap horizon has value of 2 through 4 moist and 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It has moderate granular or subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or heavy silt loam.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe B portion of the B/E horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay and occupies 55 to 65 percent of the horizon.  The E portion has value of 4 or 5 moist, 7 or 8 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry and occupies 30 to 45 percent of the B/E horizon.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist, 2 or 3 dry.  It has many to continuous, thin to thick clay films on faces of peds and in pores.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 15 percent."

Coveland soils have a very gravelly E horizon.  Coweeman soils are strongly acid to moderately acid in the A horizon and lack a B/E horizon.  Hardscrabble soils are very strongly acid to the 2Bt horizon and lack a B/E horizon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils occur on high terraces and foothills at elevations of 150 to 2,000 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  They formed in mixed material weathered from glacial and sedimentary sources.  These soils occur in a climate with 40 to 70 inches annual precipitation occurring mostly as rain in the winter.  Mean January temperature is 38 degrees F, mean July temperature is 65 degrees F, and mean annual temperature is 52 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 150 to 200 days."
