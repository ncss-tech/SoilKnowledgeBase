  "OVERVIEW": "The Stendal series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in acid, silty alluvium. These soils are on flood plains and flood-plain steps. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

The poorly drained and very poorly drained Bonnie soils are on broad flood plains, and on backswamps. The well drained Cuba soils and the moderately well drained Steff soils are on higher lying flood-plain steps, and on natural levees. The well drained, less clayey Haymond soils and the moderately well drained, less clayey Wilbur soils are typically on lower lying flood-plain steps, and on natural levees. The well drained, more sandy Pope soils are typically on natural levees."

In undrained areas, the depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2.0 feet) between December and April in normal years. Duration of the intermittent apparent high water table is considerably less in drained areas. The potential for surface water runoff ranges from negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high. Permeability is moderate. This soil is subject to frequent to rare periods of flooding."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was reclassified (4/2001) as an inceptisol based on the Eighth Edition of the \"Keys to Soil Taxonomy\" and the presence of a cambic horizon in the majority of pedons. A clayey substratum phase is recognized, and will likely be proposed as a new series when subset surveys with this phase are updated. Stendal soils have an irregular decrease in organic-carbon content between a depth of 25 to 130 cm (10 to 50 inches).\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the soil surface to 20 cm (8 inches) (Ap horizon).\nCambic horizon: from 20 to 102 cm (8 to 40 inches) (Bw, Bg horizons).\nRedoximorphic features: from 20 to 152 cm (8 to 60 inches).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data available: Agricultural Experiment Station, Purdue University (unpublished), file no. SC8707, S87IN143-7.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
