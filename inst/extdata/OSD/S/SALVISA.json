  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Basco, Belpre, Brooke, Caleast, Fleming, and McAfee series of the same family.  The Basco soils are developed under lower rainfall conditions (28 to 35 inches) and have interstratification of sandstone and shale.  The Belpre soils have hues redder than 10YR and have a paralithic contact between 40 and 70 inches.  The Brooke soils typically lack grayish mottles in the B horizon, but the 10YR and 2.5Y hue of the B horizons overlap that of the Salvisa soils.  The Brooke soils, also have slow permeability, and generally a higher percent fragments in the C horizon.  Caleast soils have sola and bedrock at a depth greater than 40 inches.  Fleming and McAfee soils have B horizons in hues redder than 10YR and Fleming soils have soft clay shales at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."
