Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  Limestone fragments from 1 to 10 inches range from 0 to 10 percent in the solum, and 0 to 25 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value and chroma of 3 or less.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam or sitly clay.\nWhen present, the AB or BA horizon, has hue 10YR, value of 4, and chromas of 2 through 4.  Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6, with mottles in shades of gray, brown or olive in the lower part.  Texture is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6, with mottles in shades of gray, brown, or olive or is mottled horizon in these shades.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Basco, Belpre, Brooke, Caleast, Fleming, and McAfee series of the same family.  The Basco soils are developed under lower rainfall conditions (28 to 35 inches) and have interstratification of sandstone and shale.  The Belpre soils have hues redder than 10YR and have a paralithic contact between 40 and 70 inches.  The Brooke soils typically lack grayish mottles in the B horizon, but the 10YR and 2.5Y hue of the B horizons overlap that of the Salvisa soils.  The Brooke soils, also have slow permeability, and generally a higher percent fragments in the C horizon.  Caleast soils have sola and bedrock at a depth greater than 40 inches.  Fleming and McAfee soils have B horizons in hues redder than 10YR and Fleming soils have soft clay shales at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."

Originally vegetation was hardwoods with many grassy glades of grasses and sedges.  Trees were chiefly white, overcup, black and red oaks, black walnut, black and honey locust, ash, hickory, hackberry, Yaupon, elm and maple, redcedars common in places."
