  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and depth to the fractured porcelanite is 5 to 10 inches.  The porcelanite beds are from 5 to over 100 feet thick.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 47 to 52 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is about 59 to 67 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is loam or clay loam.  It has 0 to 15 percent fine porcelanite chips.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Matrix texture is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam, averaging between 18 and 35 percent clay. Fine porcelanite chips range from 0 to 30 percent. They are gravel or channers.  This horizon is neutral through moderately alkaline.  Carbonates are found in the lower part of this horizon in some pedons.\nThe Bk and C horizons, have hue of 10R through 10YR.  The soil matrix is less than 10 percent of these horizons by volume.  Coarse fragments of fractured and folded porcelanite make up about 90 to 100 percent and are gravel, channer, and cobble size. Carbonates occur on the undersides of some coarse fragments in the Bk horizon. This horizon does not meet the requirements of a calcic horizon.  There is too little fine earth to fill most of the interstices larger than one mm."

They formed in materials weathered from the underlying porcelanite beds.  Elevation is 4,500 to 5,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 to 15 inches, of which over half falls in April, May, and June.  The mean annual air temperature is about 45 to 52 degrees F.
