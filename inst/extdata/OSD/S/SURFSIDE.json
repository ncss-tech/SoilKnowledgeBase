Some pedons have buried horizons at depths of more than 102 cm (40 in).  Some pedons have an organic surface horizon less than 5 cm (2 in) thick.  In most years, cracks 1 cm or more wide extend from the surface to a depth of 51 cm (20 in).  Some pedons have a few slickensides.\nAg horizons:\nUpper Ag\nHue: 10YR\nValue: 2 or 3\nChroma: 1 or 2\nLower Ag\nHues: 10YR and 7.5YR\nValues: 3 or 4\nChroma: 1 or 2\nTexture: clay, but includes silty clay.

Textures range from loam to clay that is stratified with clayey or sandy layers."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Surfside soils are very poorly drained.  Runoff is high, and permeability is very slow.  A water table fluctuates from the soil surface to a depth of about 127 cm (50 in).  The soils are occasionally flooded by fresh water during periods of high rainfall, and salt water during Gulf storms, or extremely high tides.  The soil is saturated at or near the surface for periods of 4 to 6 months during the year."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Surfside soils were formerly considered a saline phase of the Pledger series.\nClassification changed from Vertic Haplaquolls to Vertic Endoaquolls 11/2000 based on typifying pedon description.  These soils do not have slickensides or wedge-shaped peds, so do not classify as Vertisols.  Further study and characterization data of the series is needed to verify hydrology and classification.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 36 cm (0 to 14 in) (Ag1 horizon)\nAquic feature: dominant chroma of 2 or less with iron concentrations of higher chroma.\nVertic feature: 1 cm wide cracks extend to 51 cm (20 in) in most years, have COLE of .09 or more and contain 35 percent or more clay in a layer 51 cm (20 in) thick. PLE is more than 6 cm in the upper 102 cm (40 in) of the soil profile.\nADDITIONAL DATA: National Soil Survey Laboratory data from Brazoria County, Texas (S76TX-039-006) -(76PO756, 76PO758).\nTaxonomic Version: Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
