  "OVERVIEW": "The Sandcreek series consists of shallow, excessively drained soils that formed in sandy eolian material from mixed sources influenced by local alluvium.  Sandcreek soils are on undulating basalt plains.  Permeability is very rapid.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Blacksan soils are moderately deep and are on convex positions.   Eginbench soils are on lower river terraces and have an induced water table.  Engett soils are deep or very deep and are found in concavities.  Juniperbute soils are adjacent to sand dunes and lack organic carbon to meet mollic criteria.  St. Anthony soils are on lower river terraces and are moderately deep to sand and gravel."
