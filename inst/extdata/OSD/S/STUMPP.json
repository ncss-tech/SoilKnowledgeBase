  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 25 inches thick.  Thin and inconsistent A2 horizons occur in some pedons.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 6 inches.  Depth to the sandy-skeletal IIC horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 36 inches.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate and other soluble salts range from 3 to 30 inches.  Some visible salt accumulation normally occurs throughout the B2t horizons but may be deeper in some pedons.  Conductivity ranges from less than 1 to 15 millimhos in the solum.  ESP ranges from 15 to 30 percent in the solum but increases with depth and exceeds 30 percent in the Csa horizon of some pedons.  Mottling within the control section not due to segregation of lime ranges from fine faint mottles to common distinct mottles below the mollic epipedon.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above the IIC horizon and are mainly 1/4 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 try, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from mildly alkaline to very strongly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 6 dry, 2 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is typically heavy clay loam or clay and averages 35 to 60 percent clay, 5 to 50 percent silt, and 10 to 40 percent sand.  This horizon ranges from moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR; subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  It ranges from strongly to very strongly alkaline and has 3 to 4 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stumpp soils are on flood plains and in concave drainageways.  Slopes typically range from 0 to about 6 percent.  These soils formed in moderately thin, calcareous, fine textured alluvial materials overlying sand and gravel beds.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 15 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer.  Mean annual temperature is 38 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 56 degrees F."
