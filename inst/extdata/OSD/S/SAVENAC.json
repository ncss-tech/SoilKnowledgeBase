  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F. and average summer soil temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F. These moist soils are above the wilting point most of the year. They range from strongly acid to slightly alkaline and are noncalcareous. The very pale brown to pale brown ash-rich A horizon ranges from 7 to 14 inches thick. Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 80 inches. Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR. Value is greater than 6 in the 2E horizon and ranges from 5 through 7 in the B horizon. The A and 2E horizons are silt loam or loam with estimated 6 to 10 percent clay in the A horizons and 10 to 20 percent clay in the 2E horizons.\nThe A horizons have air dry bulk density estimated as ranging from .6 to .9 grams per cc. They are neutral to moderately acid, have estimated base saturation ranging from 30 to 50 percent and cation exchange capacity ranging from 120 to 250 millequivalents per 100 grams of clay including 1 to 3 percent organic carbon.\nThe 2E horizons have air dry bulk density ranging from 1.5 to 1.8 grams per cc, have 70 to 80 percent base saturation, and have 60 to 80 millequivalents exchange capacity per 100 grams of clay.\nThe mixed 2E/B and 2B/E horizons are silty clay loam or silty clay with variable amounts of gravel up to 35 percent.\nThe 2Bt horizons are silty clay loam or silty clay with 35 to 45 percent clay and with variable amounts of gravel up to 35 percent. They have air dry bulk density ranging from 1.5 to 1.7 grams per cc, have base saturation ranging from 80 to 95 percent, and have 30 to 50 millequivalents exchange capacity per 100 grams of clay."

The soils formed in loess, high in volcanic ash, superimposed over silty and clayey lacustrine materials. The climate is cool subhumid with cool dry summers and cold moist winters. Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches. Average July temperature is 63 degrees F. and average January temperature is 22 degrees F."
