These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuff, rhyolite, chert, shale, and argillite.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,740 to 2,750 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 460 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."

Hapgood soils are deep to lithic contacts, have thick mollic epipedons, cryic temperature regime, and do not have argillic horizons.  Quarz soils are clayey-skeletal, moderately deep to lithic contacts, and have an aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric."
