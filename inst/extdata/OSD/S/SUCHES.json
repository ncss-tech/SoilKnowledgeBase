Flakes of mica range from few to many in all horizons. Gravel size rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in the C and Cg horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. Few or common brownish or yellowish mottles occur in some pedons. It is loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe upper part of the B horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 8. Mottles in shades of brown and yellow are none to common. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. Few to many, brownish mottles are in the upper part of the B horizon of some pedons and in the lower part of most pedons. Some pedons contain mottles with chroma of 2 or less in the lower part of this horizon, at depths greater than 24 inches below the surface.\nThe lower part of the B horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 6. There are few to many mottles in shades of red, brown and gray. It is sandy loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bg horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, with mottles in shades of red, yellow, brown and gray. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 8. There are common to many mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow, and gray or it is mottled in the same colors. It is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, silt loam, clay loam or their gravelly analogues.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 2.

Arkaqua and French soils are poorer drained. Bermudian, Clifty, Rowdy, and Spargus soils lack mica flakes in the profile. Greendale soils have siliceous mineralogy. Tate soils have an argillic horizon."

They formed in loamy alluvial sediments washed largely from soils formed in residuum from granite, gneiss, schist, phyllite, and other metamorphic and crystalline rocks. Slopes are 0 to 6 percent. The elevation is 1500 to 3000 feet. Mean annual precipitation is about 50 to 75 inches and evenly distributed throughout the year. Mean annual temperature is about 50 to 59 degrees F."
