  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Spillville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained or somewhat poorly drained soils formed in dark colored, medium-textured alluvium.  Spillville soils are on nearly level flood plains and gently sloping footslopes on uplands.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
