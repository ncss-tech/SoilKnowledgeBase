  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates ranges from 10 to 24 inches and depth to shattered reddish clinker or porcelanite ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Porcelanite, as sand grains or channery fragments, is mixed throughout the solum in some pedons.  Stony phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, silt loam or clay loam.  It is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is a loam, silt loam or clay loam averaging between 18 and 30 percent clay.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  It has weak to strong prismatic structure that parts to moderate or strong blocky structure.  Some pedons formed in noncalcareous porcelanite beds and do not have carbonates.  Some pedons have a nonargillic Bt horizon or a Bk horizon.\nThe C horizon is loam or clay loam with 5 to 30 percent porcelanite channers.  The 2C horizon is shattered porcelanite with some sandy material on flat surfaces.  White carbonate coatings are on channer surfaces in some pedons.  The C horizons are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Searing soils are on level to rolling uplands with slope gradients of 0 to 15 percent.  The soil formed in sedimentary material weathered in place on porcelanite or clinkers from burned-out coal veins.  The climate is cool, semiarid, with mean annual temperature of 39 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation of 13 to 18 inches.  Three-fourths of the moisture falls in the spring and summer."

Brandenburg and Ringling soils have porcelanite at a depth of less than 20 inches. None of the other soils have fragmental material at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."
