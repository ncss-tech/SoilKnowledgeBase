  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the cambic horizon ranges from 13 to 30 inches but is typically greater than 20 inches.  Because of surface recharge, the soils are more commonly calcareous throughout; but depth to continuous zones of carbonate accumulation (or Bk horizon) is 15 to 30 inches in most pedons.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. and is never moist in all parts for as long as 60 consecutive days when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F., which occurs about April 21-27, but is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days from July 15 to October 25 and for at least 90 cumulative days during this period.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days. Textures for the entire profile and each horizon are clay loam, clay, silty clay or silty clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay.  Rock fragments range up to 5 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw or cambic horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Dry consistence is hard or very hard.\nThe Bk or C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent averages 5 to 14 percent, but some discontinuous strata exceed 14 percent in some pedons.   The measured ESP is less than 15 percent, but field tests show reactions over 8.6 in many pedons.\nThe Cr horizon is soft, massive clay shale which limits water intake and root growth.  It forms a paralithic contact."

Elevations are 3,500 to 6,000 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 13 inches with over half falling in April, May, and June and less than one inch falling in each month of July, August, September, and October.  Precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."
