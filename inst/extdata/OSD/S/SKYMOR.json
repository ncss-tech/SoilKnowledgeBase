  "OVERVIEW": "The Skymor series consists of shallow, well-drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from metasedimentary, metavolcanic, and sedimentary rocks.  Skymor soils are on south-facing side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 105 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Depth to a lithic contact is 12 to 20 inches.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.  Soil reaction is strongly acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 to 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam with 18 to 25 percent clay.  It has 35 to 50 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.\nThe B horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 to 5 moist and 3 to 6 dry.  It is very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly loam, or very gravelly clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay.  It has 35 to 60 percent gravel, 5 to 15 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones."
