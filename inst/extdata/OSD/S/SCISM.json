  "OVERVIEW": "The Scism series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils with moderate permeability on plains.  They formed in loess and weathered volcanic ash over loamy alluvium from basalt, volcanic ash and lacustrine deposits.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

These soils formed in loess and weathered volcanic ash over loamy alluvium from lacustrine deposits, volcanic ash and basalt.  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches, including up to 25 inches of snow.  Average annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 100 to 160 days."

There will be further investigation from an MLRA project level as to the accepted terms for use.\nClassificaiton of this pedon reflects a revision as of 4/00 from coarse-silty, mixed, mesic Haploxerollic Durorthids to coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Xereptic Haplodurids based on revisions to Soil Taxonomy.\nBedrock substratum phases of the Scism series will no longer meet the series concent and will be new soils.  (see Ada County Area, Idaho soil survey).\nMore investigation is needed on this series to determine the presence of sodium and/or salts.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
