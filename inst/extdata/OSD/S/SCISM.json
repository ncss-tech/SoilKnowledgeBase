  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Scism soils are on lava plains, shield volcanoes, calderas, terraces, draws, and tablelands at elevations of 2,000 to 5,000 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent, but most commonly are less than 8 percent.  These soils formed in loess and weathered volcanic ash over loamy alluvium from lacustrine deposits, volcanic ash and basalt.  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches, including up to 25 inches of snow.  Average annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 100 to 160 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 8 inches (Ap horizon)\nHaplic duripan - the zone from 21 to 30 inches (Bkqm horizon)\nCalcic horizon - the zone from 8 to 42 inches (Bk1, Bk2, Bkqm and Bkq horizons)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 21 inches\nSoil moisture regime - aridic bordering xeric\nGeographic setting - terms used throughout MLRA 11 to identify the setting of this soil are quite varied although all equate to the same landscape.  There will be further investigation from an MLRA project level as to the accepted terms for use.\nClassificaiton of this pedon reflects a revision as of 4/00 from coarse-silty, mixed, mesic Haploxerollic Durorthids to coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Xereptic Haplodurids based on revisions to Soil Taxonomy.\nBedrock substratum phases of the Scism series will no longer meet the series concent and will be new soils.  (see Ada County Area, Idaho soil survey).\nMore investigation is needed on this series to determine the presence of sodium and/or salts.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
