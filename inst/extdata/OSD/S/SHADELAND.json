  "REVDATE": "05/2007",
  "STATES": "IL,IN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Shadeland series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of silty material and in the underlying drift and residuum weathered from acid, shale, siltstone, or sandstone. The Shadeland soils are on rock terraces in areas influenced by Wisconsinan glaciation. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",

All these soils except Angola, Mitiwanga, and Nuhi soils do not have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Angola soils occur in MLRAs 101, 139 and 140 where the mean annual temperature is less than 10 degrees C (50 degrees F). Mitiwanga soils are not underlain by interbedded sandstone, shale, and siltstone bedrock. Nuhi soils have carbonates within the series control section or the underlying bedrock is effervescent."

The soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of silty material and in the underlying drift and residuum. In places the residuum is from stratified sandstone, shale, and siltstone, but in other areas the residuum is from a single component. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1067 mm (36 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges fro 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 54 degrees F)."
