    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Angola, Appleton, Ayrshire, Burdett, Crawleyville, Darien, Digby, Mitiwanga, Mongle, Nuhi, Ovid, Sleeth, and Whitaker series. All these soils except Angola, Mitiwanga, and Nuhi soils do not have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Angola soils occur in MLRAs 101, 139 and 140 where the mean annual temperature is less than 10 degrees C (50 degrees F). Mitiwanga soils are not underlain by interbedded sandstone, shale, and siltstone bedrock. Nuhi soils have carbonates within the series control section or the underlying bedrock is effervescent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Shadeland soils are on rock terraces influenced by Wisconsinan glaciation. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. The soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of silty material and in the underlying drift and residuum. In places the residuum is from stratified sandstone, shale, and siltstone, but in other areas the residuum is from a single component. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1067 mm (36 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges fro 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 54 degrees F)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Fox, High Gap, Homer, Miami, Ockley, Russell, and Westland soils. The well drained High Gap soils are on higher lying rises on bedrock terraces. The well drained Fox and Ockley soils are on higher lying terraces underlain with sand and gravel. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Westland soils are in depressions on adjacent terraces underlain with sand and gravel. The moderately well drained Miami and well drained Russell soils are on nearby uplands."

The depth to the top of an intermittent high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2.0 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow in the solum."
