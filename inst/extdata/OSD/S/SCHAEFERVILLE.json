  "OVERVIEW": "The Schaeferville series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived primarily from red silty shale.  Schaeferville soils are on lower backslopes and footslopes of escarpments and foothills and mountains.  Slopes range from 6 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
