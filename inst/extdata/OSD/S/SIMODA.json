    "content": "REMARKS: The name is from a community in Pendleton County. This soil was formerly included in the Cookport series.\nThe 2017 revision reclassifies the series from Fine-loamy, mixed, semiactive, frigid Typic\nFragiudepts to Coarse-loamy, siliceous, active, frigid Aquic Fragiorthods and re-defines the parent material concept from residuum to colluvium.  These revisions are based on field projects conducted during 2014 through 2017 and laboratory analysis of two sampled pedons.  The typical pedon was relocated but occurs in the same map unit delineation as the original typical pedon.  The particle-size class is border-line fine-loamy/coarse-loamy.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 inches) (Oi, Oe, A, E horizons)\nAlbic horizon--the zone from 10 to 28 cm (4 to 11 inches) (E horizon)\nSpodic horizon--the zone from 28 to 51 cm (11 to 21 inches) (Bs horizon)\nFragipan--the zone from 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) (2Bx1, 2Bx2  horizons)\nAquic conditions-the zone from 51 to 165 cm (20 to 65 inches) (2Bx1, 2Bx2, 3C horizons)\nOther soil features identified with this pedon:\nLithologic discontinuity--at the upper boundary of the 2Bx1 horizon at 51 cm (20 inches).\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 150 cm (0 to 59 inches)\nLithic contact--the contact at 165 cm (65 inches)\nADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL characterization data is available for pedons S2015WV071001 and S2015WV083001.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
