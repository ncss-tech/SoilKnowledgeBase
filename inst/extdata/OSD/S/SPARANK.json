  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sparank series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium, fan alluvium, and stream alluvium derived from shale and sandstone. Sparank soils are on alluvial fans on valley sides and stream terraces, swales, and flood plains on valley floors. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
