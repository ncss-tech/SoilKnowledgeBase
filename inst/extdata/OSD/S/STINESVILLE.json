  "OVERVIEW": "The Stinesville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and in the underlying paleosol formed in till and residuum from limestone. The Stinesville soils are on hills and in sinkholes on till plains. Slope ranges from 2 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
