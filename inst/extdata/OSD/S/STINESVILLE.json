Hootentown soils average more than 0.5 percent organic carbon in the lower part of the series control section. Navilleton soils average more than 45 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Peridge soils have hue redder than 7.5YR in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Ryker soils have some part of the argillic horizon above a depth of 102 cm (40 inches) that has rock fragments. Winnipeg soils are formed in loess, hillslope sediments, colluvium, or residuum and are on structural benches, strath terraces, and footslopes."

The soils formed in loess and in the underlying paleosol formed in till and residuum from limestone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1067 to 1143 mm (42 to 45 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 12 to 13 degrees C (53 to 56 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 170 to 200 days."
