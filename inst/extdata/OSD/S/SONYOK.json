  "OVERVIEW": "The Sonyok series consists of very deep, very poorly drained sodium affected soils in swales and on low fan terraces in the Hot Springs Valley.  These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevation is 790 to 880 meters.  The average annual precipitation is about 310 mm; the average annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
