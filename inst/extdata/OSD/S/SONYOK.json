  "OVERVIEW": "The Sonyok series consists of very deep, very poorly drained sodium affected soils in swales and on low fan terraces in the Hot Springs Valley.  These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevation is 2,600 to 2,900 feet.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches; the average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
