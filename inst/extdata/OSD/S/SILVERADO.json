  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks high in siliceous material with a component of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,800 to 2,140 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
