  "OVERVIEW": "The Silverado series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of volcanic ash.  Silverado soils are on beach terraces, inset fans, and fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 225 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
