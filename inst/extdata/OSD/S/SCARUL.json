The moisture control section (19 to 53 inches) is dry from early early August to early November and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the time.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from early May to early December and exceeds 47 degrees F from early June to early November.  Organic carbon ranges from 8 to 10 Kg/m2 to a depth of 100 cm.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 6/4 or 6/6.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4, 4/4 or 4/6. Rock fragments range from 40 to 55 percent, mostly gravel\nThe BA horizon is 7.5YR 5/4, 6/4, 6/6, 7/4 or 5 YR 6/6.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6 or 5YR 4/6.  It is 20 to 25 percent clay and 40 to 60 percent rock fragments.\nThe Bt horizon is 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6, 5/8, 6/6, 7/4; 5YR 6/4, 6/6 or 7/6.

The lower part below a depth of 40 inches is 35 to 40 percent clay.   Rock fragments range from 40 to 60 percent.  Base saturation of the argillic horizon ranges from 10 to 45 percent but decreases with depth.  Below a depth of 40 inches base saturation ranges from 10 to 35 percent. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid."
