  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 14 inches thick.  Depth to the underlying till is 20 to 40 inches.  The upper sandy sediments average less than 10 percent rock fragments that are mostly less than 3 inches.  A thin gravelly layer is at the boundary between the sandy sediments and the glacial till in some pedons.  The soil is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.  The depth to loamy fine sand or coarser textures ranges from 12 to 24 inches.\nAn Oa horizon less than 8 inches thick is present in some pedons of the depressional phase.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or is neutral, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 0 or 1.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  These textures with a mucky modifier occur in the depressional phases.\nAn Ak horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe Bkg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Textures of fine sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand are allowed in the lower part.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.   Some pedons have a Bg horizon that has these same properties.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam or clay loam.  It contains 2 to 12 percent gravel.  Some pedons have a 2Bkg horizon up to 12 inches thick that has these same properties."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Strathcona soils are on flat and slightly concave areas of lake plains.  Slope gradients are 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in 20 to 40 inches of loamy and sandy glaciolacustrine sediments over loamy calcareous till.  Mean annual air temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 19 to 24 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 90 to 130 days.  The elevation ranges from 850 to 1250 feet."

The moderately well and somewhat poorly drained Grimstad soils are on higher lying positions.  The poorly and very poorly drained Kratka soils and the poorly drained Rosewood and Vallers soils are on positions similar to those of the Strathcona soils.  Kratka soils do not have a calcic horizon within 16 inches.  Rosewood soils are sandy throughout.  Vallers soils are loamy throughout."

Permeability is moderately rapid and rapid in the upper part and moderate or moderately slow in the lower part.  Depth to an apparent seasonal high water table is as high as 0.5 to 1.5 feet at some time from April to July in most years for the poorly drained phase when not drained.  It is at plus 1 to 0.5 foot at some time from January to December in most years for the very poorly drained (depressional) phase.  A very wet phase with seasonal high water table at 0 to 0.5 feet is recognized for seepy areas."
