  "STATES": "NE",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sarben series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in reworked loamy and sandy sediments in the sand-loess transition areas.  These upland soils have slopes ranging from 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C. (49 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation is about 41 centimeters (16 inches) at the type location.",
