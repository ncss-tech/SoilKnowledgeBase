    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist and is dry for less than 45 consecutive days between the depths of 4 and 12 inches during the four month period following the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F. The difference between the mean winter and mean summer soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F. under canopy cover. The particle-size control section has greater than 15 percent particles 0.1 to 2.0 mm and less than 15 percent gravel.  Rock fragments, when present, are angular and subangular in shape and are colluvial in origin.  It is 40 to over 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 21 inches thick. The upper 7 to 12 inches of the epipedon has an acid-oxalate aluminum plus one-half iron of 2.0 to 3.0 percent, a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cc, phosphate retention of more than 85 percent, and 15-bar moisture of more than 15 percent. The lower part to a depth of 21 inches has an acid-oxalate aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 3.0 percent and a moist bulk density of 0.90 to 1.0 g/cc. Andic soil properties do not extend beyond 14 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is medial loam.  It is 15 to 20 percent clay by field estimate and 0 to 10 percent gravel. It is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 5 moist and dry. Texture is loam or clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent gravel. It is extremely acid to very strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has variegated colors. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam and averages 15 to 25 percent clay with 0 to 35 percent sandstone paragravel. It is extremely acid to very strongly acid."

Condorbridge soils are very deep, do not have an Oi horizon, and rock fragments, when present, are dominantly rounded and subrounded in shape derived from alluvial origin.  Grassyknob and Reedsport soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. Horseprairie soils have an umbric epipedon 20 to 40 inches thick. Skipanon soils have a particle-size control section with 15 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles, with 5 to 20 percent paragravel in the lower part of the cambic horizon."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from dominantly from sandstone with some areas of metasedimentary or metavolcanic origin. The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers. Many summer days have fog or low cloud cover during the morning. The mean annual precipitation 60 to 100 inches. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F. The frost-free period is 145 to 270 days."

If accepted, medial modifiers would be used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not meeting andic soil properties.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
