They formed in alluvium derived locally from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum of Precambrian granite bedrock. Slopes are 5 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 7,000 to 7,600 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

Arnor soils are fine-loamy, do not have calcic horizons and fragmental materials, and occur on toeslopes of hills. Atalaya soils are coarse-loamy over fragmental, do not have calcic horizons, and occur on beveled summits. Enmedio soils are loamy-skeletal over fragmental, have mollic epipedons but do not have calcic horizons, and occur on backslopes of hills."
