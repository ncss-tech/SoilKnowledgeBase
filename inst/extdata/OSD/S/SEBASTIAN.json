    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay and 40 to 85 percent rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  Solum thickness and thickness of the mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches.  The solum is moderately acid to neutral throughout.  Hue is 5YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is very cobbly loam or very gravelly loam averaging 18 to 25 percent clay.  It has 20 to 40 percent gravel, 10 to 30 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is very cobbly loam, very cobbly clay loam, or extremely cobbly clay loam averaging 25 to 35 percent clay.  It has 15 to 30 percent gravel, 20 to 40 percent cobbles, and 5 to 15 percent stones."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sebastian soils occur on metastable ridgetops and active side slopes of coastal hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from serpentinized metasedimentary or serpentinized metavolcanic rock types.  Elevations are 200 to 1000 feet.  The climate is humid, characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 95 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 200 to 270 days."
