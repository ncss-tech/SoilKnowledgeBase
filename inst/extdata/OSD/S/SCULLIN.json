  "OVERVIEW": "The Scullin series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from limestone or dolomitic limestone of Ordovician age.  These soils are on very gently sloping to sloping convex uplands in the Grand Prairie.  Slopes are 2 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F.",
