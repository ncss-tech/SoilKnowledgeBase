Mollic epipedon is 8 to 16 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.  It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy fine sandy.  It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Btn, Btkn, and Bk horizons have hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 3.  They are clay loam or sandy clay loam estimated to average between 20 and 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Exchanageable sodium percentage exceeds 15 percent in some part of the Bt horizon.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Carbonate is present in the Btk and Bk horizons as few or common, fine or medium accumulations and striations.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2,5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is fine sandy loam or sandy loam, but sandy clay loam and clay loam strata are in some pedons.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
