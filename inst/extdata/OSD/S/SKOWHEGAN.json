  "OVERVIEW": "The Skowhegan series consists of very deep, moderately well and somewhat poorly drained soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits on outwash plains and stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  Permeability is moderately rapid or rapid.  Mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches at the type location.",

The soils formed in glacial outwash material of nearly uniform fine and medium sand sizes derived mainly from slate, phyllite, and other dark colored metamorphic and sedimentary rocks.  The climate is humid and cool temperate.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 44 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 44 inches.  The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 140 days.  Elevation ranges from 150 to 1200 feet above mean sea level."

The Charles, Cornish, Fryeburg, and Lovewell soils are on floodplains.  The Masardis and Stetson soils are better drained and have more than 35 percent gravel in the particle-size control section."
