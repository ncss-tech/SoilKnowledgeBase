  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 24 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Coarse fragments throughout the soil are less than 1 percent by volume.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the solum and strongly acid to moderately acid in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, with value and chroma of 2 to 4.  The Ap horizon, where present, has a hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is commonly loamy fine sand but ranges from sand to fine sandy loam.  It has weak or moderate, fine or medium granular structure.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is commonly loamy fine sand but ranges from sand to fine sandy loam.  It has weak or moderate, fine or medium granular structure.\nThe upper B horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is mainly loamy fine sand but includes fine sand and sand.  It has weak or moderate, fine granular structure.\nThe lower B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is mainly loamy fine sand but includes fine sand and sand.  It has weak, fine or medium granular structure or is single grain.  Consistence is friable, very friable or loose.\nThe C horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 0 to 4.  I is loamy sand, sand or loamy fine sand.  Consistence is friable or loose with the silt or very fine sand lenses being slightly firm in place."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Skowhegan soils are on outwash plains and stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  The soils formed in glacial outwash material of nearly uniform fine and medium sand sizes derived mainly from slate, phyllite, and other dark colored metamorphic and sedimentary rocks.  The climate is humid and cool temperate.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 44 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 44 inches.  The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 140 days.  Elevation ranges from 150 to 1200 feet above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Adams, Berkshire, Charles, Cornish, Fryeburg, Lovewell, Masardis, and Stetson soils.  The Adams soils are somewhat excessively drained soils in higher positions on the landscape.  The Berkshire soils formed in glacial till on adjacent till plains and ridges.  The Charles, Cornish, Fryeburg, and Lovewell soils are on floodplains.  The Masardis and Stetson soils are better drained and have more than 35 percent gravel in the particle-size control section."
