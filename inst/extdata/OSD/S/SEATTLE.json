  "OVERVIEW": "The Seattle series consists of very deep, very poorly drained organic soils formed in herbaceous and woody deposits in depressions in river valleys and glacial till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 40 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The organic deposits range in depth from 51 inches to more than 40 feet.  Mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F. The difference between mean winter and mean summer soil temperature is 15 to 30 degrees F.  Fibers are mostly from sedges but some pedons are up to 25 percent wood fragments.  The subsurface and bottom tiers (12 to 51 inches) contain 10 to 25 inches of hemic material.  The soils are very strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe surface tier (0 to 12 inches) has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 1 to 4 moist, 2 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4 moist or dry.  It is sapric material, with 5 to 40 percent fibers, unrubbed, and less than 10 percent rubbed. This tier has moderate or strong granular structure.\nThe subsurface tier (12 to 36 inches) has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 5 moist or dry.  It is more than one-half sapric material.  It is sapric and hemic material with thin layers of sedge peat.  The fiber content ranges from 30 to 70 percent, 10 to 35 percent rubbed.\nThe bottom tier (36 to 51 inches) is similar in color to the subsurface tier and fiber content is generally higher than the subsurface tier."

Pinnebog soils have a difference between mean winter and mean summer temperature of more than 30 degrees F and the soil reaction of Pinnebog soils are typically slightly alkaline.

Seattle soils formed in organic materials. These soils occur in a mild marine climate having cool dry summers and mild wet winters.  The average annual precipitation is 25 to 50 inches. The average January temperature is 38 degrees F, the average July temperature is 64 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The average frost free season is 150 to 250 days."
