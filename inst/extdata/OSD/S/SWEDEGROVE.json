  "OVERVIEW": "The Swedegrove series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in till. They are on nearly level to slightly convex slopes on moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters.",
