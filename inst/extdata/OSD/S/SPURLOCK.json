  "OVERVIEW": "The Spurlock series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in calcareous loamy eolian sediments.  These soils are on nearly level to sloping uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in) and the mean annual air temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
