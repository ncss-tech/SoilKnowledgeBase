  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sparham soils formed in alluvium and stream alluvium on flood plains on valley floors and alluvial fans on valley sides. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Average annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 16 inches. The precipitation is as low as 8 inches in areas where the water table or frequency of flooding contributes to the soil moisture. Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 55 degrees F., and the average frost-free season ranges from 100 to 160 days. Elevations range from 5,500 to 7,500 feet. Seasonal high water table typically is below 6 feet."
