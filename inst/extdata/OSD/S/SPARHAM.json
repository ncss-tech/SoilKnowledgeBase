  "OVERVIEW": "The Sparham series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and stream alluvium derived from shale and sandstone on alluvial fans on valley sides and flood plains on valley floors. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 55 degrees F., and the average frost-free season ranges from 100 to 160 days. Elevations range from 5,500 to 7,500 feet. Seasonal high water table typically is below 6 feet."
