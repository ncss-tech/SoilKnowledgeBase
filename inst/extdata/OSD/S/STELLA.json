The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation is 45 to 55 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 38 degrees F and in July it is 64 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.  The average growing season at 28 degrees F is 220 to 240 days.  The frost free season 32 degrees F is 165 to 180 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an umbric epipedon from the mineral surface to 11 inches, a zone of clay removal from 11 to 25 inches, and an argillic horizon from 25 to 60 inches.  The upper part of the argillic horizon from 25 to 48 inches is coated with albic material on faces of peds.  Base saturation (by sum) is assumed to be less than 75 percent in all parts of the argillic horizon and to be above 35 percent 1.25 meters below the top of the argillic horizon,based on laboratory data on the similar Rose Valley series, Number S84WA-015-009.  This soil would be in an aqultic subgroup if such were provided in Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
