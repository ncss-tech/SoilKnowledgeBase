  "OVERVIEW": "The Seelovers series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on level or nearly level low stream terraces, valley bottoms, and flood plains.  They formed in alluvium.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
