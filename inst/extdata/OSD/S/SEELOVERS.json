These soils formed in local alluvium.  Elevations range from 1,800 to 3,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid with cold wet winters and moderately warm dry summers.  The average annual precipitation is 24 to 35 inches, average annual air temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F., and the average frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."
