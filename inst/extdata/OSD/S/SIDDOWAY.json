    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Siddoway soils are on nearly level basalt plains to steep hills, at elevations of 5,000 feet to 6,100 feet.  Slopes are from 1 to 25 percent.  These soils formed in eolian deposits influenced by loess and slope alluvium from mixed sources.  The average annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches; the average annual air temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F; the average summer temperature ranges from 62 to 67 degrees F; and the frost-free season ranges from 70 to 100 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Jipper, Nayrib, Stipe, and Wolverine series.  The Jipper soils are mainly on nearly level basalt plains and have textures finer than loamy fine and.  Nayrib soils are mainly on or near rock outcrops and are very shallow over basalt.  Stipe soils are on rolling basalt plains and are less than 40 inches deep.  Wolverine soils are on stabilized dunes and lack mollic epipedons."
