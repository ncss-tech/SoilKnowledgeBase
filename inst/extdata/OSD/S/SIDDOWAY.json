  "OVERVIEW": "The Siddoway series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits from mixed sources with some influence from underlying basalt.  Siddoway soils are on nearly level to steep slopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  Permeability is rapid.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 85 days.",

Stipe soils are on rolling basalt plains and are less than 40 inches deep.  Wolverine soils are on stabilized dunes and lack mollic epipedons."
