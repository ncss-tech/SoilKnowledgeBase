The control section contains about 25 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Most pedons have a silty mantle 10 to 30 inches thick.  The A and Bw horizons consist mostly of worm casts and filled worm holes.  The mollic epipedon, below the Ap horizon, has over 50 percent by volume of worm casts, worm holes and worm filled holes and the transition to the underlying material has more than 25 percent worm casts, worm holes and worm filled holes.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.5 or less.  The A horizon is silty clay loam, silt loam or loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe AB horizon has colors and textures of the A and Bw horizons.\nThe Bw horizon has mixed colors with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silty clay loam, silt loam, loam or clay loam and is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a BA horizon.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  It has few to many worm casts, worm holes and worm filled holes.  It has few or common, fine or medium accumulations of carbonate.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  It has few or common, faint to prominent mottles.  The 2Bk and 2C horizons are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

The Singsaas soils formed in an upper mantle overlying clay loam or loam glacial till.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F and mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 24 inches.  Growing season is about 120 to 140 days; average growing season precipitation from 19 to 22 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 2900. Elevation ranges from 890 to 1950 feet above mean sea level."

Buse soils have carbonates within 7 inches of the surface when mixed and are on steeper parts of the landscape.  Oak Lake soils are lower lying on the landscape and have saturation with 20 to 40 inches of the surface.  Parnell soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the particle size conrol section, have soil saturation to the surface and are in depressions."
