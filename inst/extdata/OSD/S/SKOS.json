  "OVERVIEW": "The Skos series consists of very shallow to shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from interbedded sandstone, siltstone and shale. Skos soils occur on structural benches, ridges, and hillsides on structural benches and have slopes of 4 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
