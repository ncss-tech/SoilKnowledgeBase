  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The revision of 2/2000 eliminates the Very Deep depth class and recognizes the presence of a calcic horizon.  The phase of Shuttle which lacks duripans within 150 cm needs correlation to another series in the subgroup of Durinodic Haplocalcids.  Total extent of this phase is about 1,700 acres.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A1, A2 and part of the Bk horizons).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 15 to 114 cm (Bk, Bqk1, and Bqk2 horizons).\nDuric feature - The zone from 48 to 114 cm (Bqk1 and Bqk2 horizons).\nDuripan - The zone from 114 to 152 cm (Bqkm horizon).\nParticle size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bqk1 horizon and parts of the Bk and Bqk2 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
