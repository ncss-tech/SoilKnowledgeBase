  "OVERVIEW": "The Sweatlodge series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  Sweatlodge soils are on hills.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
