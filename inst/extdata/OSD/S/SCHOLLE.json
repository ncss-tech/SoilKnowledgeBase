Cabreros soils.  Flaco, Horchata, Progresso Sanostee and Threetop soils have bedrock (lithic contact) at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Horchata soils . Maysdorf and Spenlo soils lack calcic horizons within 40 inch depths. Cerrillos and Clovis have less than 15 percent coarse fragments.  Fernando soils are calcareous at depths of 4 inches or less and have more than 50 percent silt in the Bt horizon. Millet soils have skeletal subhorizon at 20 inches.   Fernando, Palabria and Wineg soils are deep. Selpats soils have 10YR hue. Solirec soils. Tuweep soils formed in pyroclastic material and are skeletal in the lower part of the particle size control section. Maysdorf, Selpats and Threetop soils are in LRR-G and are moist in May and June."
