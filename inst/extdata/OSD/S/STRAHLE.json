  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Strahle soils are on mountain slopes of 15 to 75 percent slope.  These soils formed in material weathered mainly from volcanic rock and/or granitic rock. In some areas volcanic and granitic rocks are interbedded.  Volcanic rocks are mainly andesite and rhyolite.  Other rocks include  calcareous metamorphic rocks that occur as outcrops and dikes.  Elevations are 3,000 to 5,000 feet.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 to 20 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 47 to 56 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 71 to 80 degrees F., the mean annual temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F. The frost-free period is about 175 to 225 days."
