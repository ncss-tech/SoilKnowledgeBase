  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  These soils are usually dry in all parts between a depth of 8 and 24 inches for one-half to three-fourths of the time when the soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 8 to 15 inches thick and has 2 to 15 percent volcanic glass and 0.15 to 0.40 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half the iron.  The control section has 5 to 14 percent clay.  Depth to a duripan is 20 to 40 inches.  Some pedons  have a zone of calcium carbonate accumulation directly above the duripan.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or  3 dry or moist.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam and is 35 to 50 percent rock fragments, including 15 to 35 percent pebbles, 5 to 30 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones.  The Bw horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline and has weak fine or medium subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bkqm horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  It is weakly or strongly cemented and crushes to fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam.  It is 15 to 40 percent pebbles, 5 to 30 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones.  It is moderately alkaline to strongly  alkaline.\nThe 2Bkd horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y.  Value is 5 through 7 dry and  4 through 6 moist.  Chroma is 1 or 2 dry or moist.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam with 10 to 40 percent pebbles, 5 to 35 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones.  Reaction is slightly  alkaline or strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stubblefield soils are on ground moraines.  These soils formed in glacial till dominantly from basalt with an admixture of loess and a minor amount of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Elevations are 1,000 to 2,800 feet.  The climate is semiarid with warm,  dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 74 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is 130 to 185  days."

Heytou soils are greater than 60 inches to duripan.  Touhey soils are ashy over loamy.  Malott soils are on till plains and glaciated hills, are 40 to 60 inches to duripan and have 5 to 30 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Peshastin soils are on moraines and terraces, are greater than 60 inches to duripan, and have acid igneous rock fragments predominating in the control section.  Pogue and Skaha soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments.  Pogue soils are 20  to 40 inches to sandy-skeletal outwash.  Skaha soils are sandy-skeletal and hve an ochric epipedon."
