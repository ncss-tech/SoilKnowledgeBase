  "OVERVIEW": "The Swanpeak series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in silty and clayey alluvium from mixed sources. Swanpeak soils are on hillslopes, mountain slopes, summits, alluvial fans, and fan remnants. Slopes are 1 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
