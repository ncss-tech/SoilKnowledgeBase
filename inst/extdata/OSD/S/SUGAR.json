  "OVERVIEW": "The Sugar series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy lacustrine sediments over calcareous clayey materials on lake plains. Permeability is moderate in the upper loamy part and very slow in the clayey material. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
