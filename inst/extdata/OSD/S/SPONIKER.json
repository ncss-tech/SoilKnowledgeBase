  "OVERVIEW": "The Sponiker series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Sponiker soils are on fan terraces and have slopes that range from 1 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
