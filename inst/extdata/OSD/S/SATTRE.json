  "REVDATE": "10/2008",
  "STATES": "IA,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sattre series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loamy alluvium and the underlying sandy and gravelly sediments. These soils are on outwash areas and on treads and risers on stream terraces in river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 775 millimeters.",
