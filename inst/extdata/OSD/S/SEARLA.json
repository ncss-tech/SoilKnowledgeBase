  "OVERVIEW": "The Searla series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium or residuum dominantly derived from igneous or sedimentary materials. Searla soils are on fan remnants, alluvial fans and colluvial slopes and have slopes of 4 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 400 mm, and the average annual air temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.",
