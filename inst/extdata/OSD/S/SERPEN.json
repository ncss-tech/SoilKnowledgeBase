  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Serpen soils are on mountainsides that generally have a south aspect.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived primarily from serpentine, with some slate, phyllite and gabbro pebbles in some pedons and a minor amount of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  Elevations are 2,500 to 4,500 feet.  These soils are in a climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters, with a snowpack from about December through March.  The average annual precipitation is 25 to 40 inches. The average January temperature is about 26 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 69 degrees F; and the average annual air temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 150 to 175 days."
