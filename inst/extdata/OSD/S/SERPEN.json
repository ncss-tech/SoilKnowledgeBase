  "OVERVIEW": "The Serpen series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from serpentine with minor amounts of volcanic ash and loess.  Serpen soils are on mountainsides.  Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 25 to 40 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived primarily from serpentine, with some slate, phyllite and gabbro pebbles in some pedons and a minor amount of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  Elevations are 2,500 to 4,500 feet.  These soils are in a climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters, with a snowpack from about December through March.  The average annual precipitation is 25 to 40 inches. The average January temperature is about 26 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 69 degrees F; and the average annual air temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 150 to 175 days."
