  "OVERVIEW": "The Saltydog series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from limestone and welded tuff.  Saltydog soils are on alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C.",
