  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is about 45 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days during summer and fall.  The solum thickness and depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and is 10 to 35 percent rock fragments.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 36 inches thick and includes all or part of the argillic horizo+Ln.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3 dry or moist.  It is silt loam with 20 to 27 percent clay.  It has 0 to 2 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe Bt and 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  The Bt is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay with 35 to 45 percent clay.  The 2Bt horizon is gravelly, very gravelly, or very cobbly with 35 to 50 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sweiting soils are on mountain plateaus, hills and benches and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in loess and slope alluvium from weathered basalt.  Elevation ranges from 3,200 to 5,000 feet.  These soils are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 22 to 35 inches but ranges to 17 inches in northeastern Oregon.  The mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F.  The average annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 70 to 110 days."
