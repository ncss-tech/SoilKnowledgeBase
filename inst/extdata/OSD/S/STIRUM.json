  "OVERVIEW": "The Stirum series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils on outwash plains, deltas, lake plains, floodplains and adjacent to current lakes.  Permeability is moderately slow in the Btn horizon and moderate to rapid below the Btn horizon.  These soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits, glaciolacustrine deposits or alluvium.  They have slope ranging from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 19 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Carbonates occur within a depth of 10 inches, but are throughout most pedons.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 24 inches.  A ponded phase is recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  It ranges from loam to loamy sand.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have an E horizon.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 3 to 6 and 4 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam containing 10 to 18 percent noncarbonate clay.  It is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  The horizon in some pedons is gleyed or contains accumulations of carbonates, salts or gypsum.  Some pedons have a Bw horizon.  It has textures the same as the Btn horizon, but has thin layers of sandy clay loam in some profiles.\nThe Bk horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 7 and 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 4 or less.  It has textures ranging from sandy clay loam to loamy fine sand.  It is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  The horizon is gleyed or contains accumulations of salts or gypsum in some pedons.  Some pedons have a BCk horizon.\nThe Cg or 2Cg horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or are neutral, value of 3 to 7 and 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 6 or less.  They have textures ranging from silt loam to fine sand.  Textures of sand are allowed below depths of 30 inches.  Some pedons contain strata of finer textures. They are moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline."
