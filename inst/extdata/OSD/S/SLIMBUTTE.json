  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free carbonates ranges from 10 to 16 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches and includes the A horizon and all or part of the Bw horizon.  Some pedons have a 1 or 2 inch layer of partially decomposed forest litter on the surface.  Rock fragments are noncalcareous hard sandstone or siltstone and make up 35 to 70 percent by volume in the control section.  The soil typically consists of rock fragments with little fine earth materials below a depth of 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is very fine sandy loam but is gravelly loam, gravelly silt loam, or gravelly very fine sandy loam in some pedons.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 25 percent by volume.  The A horizon ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 5 or 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is very fine sandy loam but is loam or silt loam in some pedons.  Rock fragments are typically pebbles and range from 30 to 50 percent by volume.  The Bw horizon ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  In some pedons, the Bw horizon does not have carbonates in the lower part.\nThe Bk horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is very fine sandy loam but is loam or fine sandy loam.  Rock fragments are typically pebbles and range from about 35 to 60 percent by volume.  The Bk horizon is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y hue; value of 6 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 1 to 4.  It typically is loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Rock fragments are pebbles and cobbles and range from 35 to 85 percent by volume.  Below 40 inches, it typically is fragmental, but some pedons are very flaggy or very cobbly sandy loam.  Some pedons have fractured bedrock below depths of 40 inches.  The C horizon is slightly or moderately alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the competing Datino, Heely, Labre, Perma, Peso, Sandia, Veatch, and the Wanagan series. Datino soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 50 inches and formed in volcanic alluvium. Heely, Peso, and Veatch soil have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Labre soils have redder hue in the solum and have fragments of porclanite rock.  Perma soils have carbonates below a depth of 40 inches.  Sandia do not have carbonates within the control section.  Wanagan soils contain less coarse fragments in the A and B horizon, have steeper slopes and formed in alluvium."

They formed in mixed colluvium weathered from hard sandstone and siltstone.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 15 inches."

The Amor, Blackhall, Cabba, Cabbart, Cohagen, and Shambo soils are on lower nearby landscapes.  Amor and Shambo soils have a fine-loamy control section.  Blackhall, Cabba, Cabbart, and Cohagen soils have paralithic bedrock at shallow depths.  The Reva and Vanocker soils are intermingled with Slimbutte soils on similar landscapes.  The Reva soils have a lithic contact at shallow depths.  Watrous and Werner soils are on gently sloping nearby landscapes.  Vanocker soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are higher on the landscape.  Watrous soils have an argillic horizon and are moderately deep to hard sandstone.  The Werner soils have soft sandstone at shallow depths."
