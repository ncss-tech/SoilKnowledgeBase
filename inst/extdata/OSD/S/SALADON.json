It is mucky silty clay, mucky silty clay loam or clay.  It has weak or strong fine and very fine granular structure.  The C1g horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is heavy silty clay loam, heavy clay loam or light clay with 37 to 50 percent clay.  The C2g horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Texture is similar to the C1g horizon."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Saladon soils are in depressions, swales and flats on gently to moderately sloping basalt flows at elevations of 8,000 to 10,000 feet.  The soils formed in fine-textured alluvium from tertiary and quaternary basalt with slight influence of Pennsylvanian sandstone and shale.  The climate is continental with an average annual temperature of about 39 degrees F. and an average summer temperature of about 53 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 18 to 20 inches with about 60 percent falling during the frost-free period."
