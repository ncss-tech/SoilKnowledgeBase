The soils formed in fine-textured alluvium from tertiary and quaternary basalt with slight influence of Pennsylvanian sandstone and shale.  The climate is continental with an average annual temperature of about 39 degrees F. and an average summer temperature of about 53 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 18 to 20 inches with about 60 percent falling during the frost-free period."
