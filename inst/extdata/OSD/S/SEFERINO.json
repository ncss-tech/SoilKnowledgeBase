Taxonomic class and moisture regime classification changed from typic aridic to ustic aridic.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 8 cm (0 to 3 inches).  (A horizon)\nCambic horizon: 8 to 41 cm (3 to 16 inches).  (Bw horizons)\nCalcic horizon: 41 to 173 cm (16 to 68 inches).  (Bk1, Bk2 and Bk3 horizons)\nSeferino soils were previously included in the Reakor series.\nADDITIONAL DATA: National Soil Survey Laboratory characterization data are available for 2 pedons; samples S91TX-043-003 and S91TX-043-206.\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
