  "OVERVIEW": "The Seferino series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable calcareous soils.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on fan skirts and alluvial flats.  They developed in calcareous alluvium and residuum derived mainly from limestone.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm (11 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.1 degrees C (70 degrees F).",
