Reaction is moderately acid to extremely acid throughout except where limed or irrigated with alkaline water.\nCrushed color of the A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral (N) with value of 2 to 4.  Uncrushed colors have a salt-and-pepper appearance.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2; hor hue of 2.5Y, value of 8, and chroma of 2; or it is neutral (N) with value of 5 to 8.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of gray, yellow, and brown.  Texture is sand or fine sand.  Combined thickness of the A and E horizons is less than 20 inches.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3; or hue of 5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 4; or it is neutral (N) with value of 2 or 3.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  Sand grains in this horizon are coated with organic matter.  A BE horizon 1/2 inch to 2 inches thick occurs above the Bh horizon in many pedons.  The organic carbon content in the Bh horizon is 0.60 to 4 percent.  Vertical or horizontal tongues and/or pockets of gray, light brownish gray, or light gray (E) material are in many pedons.  The BC part of the BC/Bh horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The Bh part is fragments of Bh material. In some pedons only a BC horizon exists without weakly cemented fragments.\nIn some pedons, there are two sequa of E' and Bh' horizons below a depth of about 40 inches.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2, or value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Where present, mottles are in shades of brown, yellow, or gray.  Texture is sand or fine sand."

Permeability of the A and E horizons are rapid, and the Bh horizon moderate or moderately rapid.  The water table is at depths of less than 18 inches for 1 to 4 months in most years and between 12 and 40 inches for more than 6 months.  In rainy seasons, the water table rises above the surface briefly.  In depressions, water stands above the surface for 6 to 9 months or more in most years."
