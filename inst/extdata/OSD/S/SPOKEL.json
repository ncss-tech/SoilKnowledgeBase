  "OVERVIEW": "The Spokel series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from granitic rocks.  Spokel soils are on canyon slopes and have gradients of 40 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist but the 4 to 10 inch layer is dry for 45 to 65 days in late summer and early fall.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 47 to 51 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is 8 to 16 inches thick.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is very gravelly or extremely gravelly sandy loam or loam and has less than 18 percent clay.\nThe C horizon is very gravelly or extremely gravelly loam or sandy loam."

Burnscreek soils are dry 60 to 75 days following the summer solstice and receive 18 to 24 inches of precipitation. Fivelakes soils are dry 90 to 105 days following the summer solstice and have sandy-skeletal material at 20 to 36 inches. Huston soils are dry 60 to 90 days following the summer solstice and have stratified C horizons. Lyville and Suta soils are deep to a lithic contact."
