  "OVERVIEW": "The Shomushon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in recent volcanic ash and cinder deposits.  The Shomushon soils are on lava plains, hills and lower mountainsides in remnant calderas of stratovolcanic islands that have been smoothed by recent volcanic fallout of ash and cinders.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 27 degrees C. (81 degrees F.), and the mean annual precipitation is about 2032 millimeters (80 inches).",
