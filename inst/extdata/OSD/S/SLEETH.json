  "OVERVIEW": "The Sleeth series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are deep to calcareous, stratified gravelly and sandy outwash. Sleeth soils formed in loamy outwash. A mantle of loess or other silty material is as much as 51 cm (20 inches) thick in some areas. They are on outwash terraces, stream terraces, and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",

Burdett and Darien soils do not have textures with as much as 85 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Digby soils have subhorizons that are finer than loamy coarse sand in the lower part of the series control section. Mongle soils are more acid that slightly alkaline in the lower part of the series control section."

Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the loamy outwash and very high in the underlying gravelly and sandy outwash. Permeability is moderate in the loamy outwash and very rapid in the underlying gravelly and sandy outwash."
