Angola, Mitiwanga, Nuhi, and Shadeland soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Appleton and Ovid soils are less than 102 cm (40 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Ayrshire, Crawleyville, and Whitaker soils average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Burdett and Darien soils do not have textures with as much as 85 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Digby soils have subhorizons that are finer than loamy coarse sand in the lower part of the series control section. Mongle soils are more acid that slightly alkaline in the lower part of the series control section."

The soils formed in loamy outwash in areas of Wisconsinan glaciation. A mantle of loess or other silty material is as much as 51 cm (20 inches) thick in some areas. They are deep to calcareous, stratified gravelly and sandy outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1143 mm (35 to 45 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 9 to 12 degrees C (48 to 54 degrees F)."

Depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2.0 feet) during the winter and early spring in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the loamy outwash and very high in the underlying gravelly and sandy outwash. Permeability is moderate in the loamy outwash and very rapid in the underlying gravelly and sandy outwash."
