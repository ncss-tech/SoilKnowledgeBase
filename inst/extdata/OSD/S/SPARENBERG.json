The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts more than 180 but less than 205 cumulative days in normal years. July through August and November through March are the driest months. These soils are intermittently moist in September through October and April through June. These soils receive runoff and are moist in the soil moisture control section for longer periods of time than the soils of surrounding uplands.\nMean annual soil temperature: 16 to 18 degrees C (60 to 65 degrees F).\nDepth to secondary calcium carbonate: 25 to more than 152 cm (10 to more than 60 in).\nDepth to slickensides: 13 to 51 cm (5 to 20 in).\nSolum thickness: more than 203 cm (80 in).\nParticle-size control section: 40 to 50 percent silicate clay.\nThis is a cyclic soil and undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microhighs 10 to 46 cm (4 to 18 in) higher than microlows.

The microhigh makes up about 25 percent, the intermediate, or area between the high and low, about 50 percent, and the microlow about 25 percent. Cracks open and close each year except during higher than normal rainfall years, and remain open for less than 150 cumulative days during most years. When dry, 1 to 7.6 cm (0.4 to 3 in) wide cracks extend from the surface to a depth of 102 cm (40 in) or more. Cracks are more prominent in the microlows. COLE is more than 0.07. Where redox features exceed 3 percent, they occur in less than 25 percent of each pedon.

It includes western wheatgrass, buffalograss, blue grama, vine\nmesquite, Texas blueweed, kochia, western ragweed, cocklebur, sunflower, and\nmares-tail.
