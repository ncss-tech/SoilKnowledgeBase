  "OVERVIEW": "The Schwalbe series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks. The Schwalbe soils are on mountain and hill sideslopes. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
