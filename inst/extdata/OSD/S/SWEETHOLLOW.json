  "OVERVIEW": "The Sweethollow series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from sandstone.  Sweethollow soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 710 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2.5 degrees C.",
