  "OVERVIEW": "The Shuksan series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and loess and glacial till, slopes alluvium andcolluvium.  Shuksan soils are on mountain shoulder slopes and plateaus with slopes of 5 to 80 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 95 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about41 degrees F.",
