The soils formed in volcanic ash, loess, and glacial till, slope alluvium, and colluvium.  Shuksan soils have cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 85 to 105 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F; the mean July temperature is about 56 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 85 to 100 days."
