  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sal soils are on fan terraces and typically have a surface cover of dark colored desert pavement.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  They formed in fan alluvium from acid and basic igneous rocks.   Elevation is 1000 to 2500 feet.  The climate is hot arid continental.  The mean annual precipitation is 2 to 10 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain.  Mean annual air temperature is 70 to 75 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 250 to 325 days."
