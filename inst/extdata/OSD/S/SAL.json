They formed in fan alluvium from acid and basic igneous rocks.   Elevation is 1000 to 2500 feet.  The climate is hot arid continental.  The mean annual precipitation is 2 to 10 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain.  Mean annual air temperature is 70 to 75 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 250 to 325 days."
