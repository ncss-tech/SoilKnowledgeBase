Boulflat soils have a duripan capping bedrock within a depth of 100 cm.  Cherry Spring soils have formed largely in loess with a component of ash; have 25 to 46 cm thick A horizons; and have a silt loam, loam or clay loam argillic horizon with less than 35 percent sand. Eastval soils have a subhorizon within the argillic horizon with more than 35 percent clay. Yody soils have moderately alkaline A and Bt horizons that are 36 to 60 cm thick over a calcic horizon and a duripan at a depth of 76 to 100 cm.  Zaidy soils have Btk horizons and have 10 to 35 percent gravel in the particle-size control section."

Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,345 to 2,200 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is about 100 to 110 days."
