  "OVERVIEW": "The Spasprey series consists of moderately deep over strongly cemented duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  These soils are on alluvial fan piedmont remnants, alluvial fans and lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Boulflat soils have a duripan capping bedrock within a depth of 100 cm.  Cherry Spring soils have formed largely in loess with a component of ash; have 25 to 46 cm thick A horizons; and have a silt loam, loam or clay loam argillic horizon with less than 35 percent sand. Eastval soils have a subhorizon within the argillic horizon with more than 35 percent clay. Yody soils have moderately alkaline A and Bt horizons that are 36 to 60 cm thick over a calcic horizon and a duripan at a depth of 76 to 100 cm.  Zaidy soils have Btk horizons and have 10 to 35 percent gravel in the particle-size control section."
