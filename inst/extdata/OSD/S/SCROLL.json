  "STATES": "IA,SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Scroll series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on flood plains. These soils formed in 8 to 20 inches of clayey or silty alluvium and the underlying sandy alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches.",
