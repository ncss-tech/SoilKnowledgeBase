In addition, Brico soils have redder hues in the control section and sola thicker than 40 inches.  Rumple soils have limestone bedrock at 20 to 40 inches depth.  Durant soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Florence soils have mean annual soil temperature of less than 59 degrees F.

Slope gradients are mostly 1 to 3 percent, but range from 1 to 5 percent.  The climate is warm subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation is 34 to 40 inches, mean annual temperature ranges from about 60 degrees to 70 degrees F, and Thornwaite P-E index ranges from 52 to 64."
