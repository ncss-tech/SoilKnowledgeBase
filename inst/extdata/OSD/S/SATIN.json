  "OVERVIEW": "The Satin Series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in ancient very gravelly clay sediments of Pliocene Age.  These gently sloping soils are on upland ridges and upper sideslopes.  Medium amounts of water run off the surface.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.",
