  "OVERVIEW": "The Saddlebrook series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in mixed fan alluvium.  Saddlebrook soils are on fan terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
