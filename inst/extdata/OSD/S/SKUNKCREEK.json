  "OVERVIEW": "The Skunkcreek series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in stratified glaciolacustrine deposits. These soils are on flats on glacial lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 670 millimeters.",
