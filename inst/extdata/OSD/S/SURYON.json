Lobert soils have average annual soil temperature of 44 to 47 degrees F. and contain durinodes.  Ola and Prucree soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Redmount soils have average annual soil temperature of 44 to 47 degrees F. and have skeletal material at 26 to 40 inches.  Shively soils have average annual soil temperature of 44 to 47 degrees F. and do not have Bw horizons.  Taterpa soils have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches and are slightly acid in the lower part of the particle-size control section and have average annual soil temperature of 43 to 47 degrees F.
