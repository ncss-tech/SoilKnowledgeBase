The particle-size control section averages 20 to 35 percent rock fragments and 5 to 10 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Texture is loam, silt loam, cobbly silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist. Texture is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam. It has 5 to 10 percent clay. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk1 horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam and is gravelly or cobbly. It has 5 to 10 percent clay and 5 to 30 calcium carbonate equivalent with no observable accumulation.\nThe Bk2 horizon has the same color range as the Bk1 horizon. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam or fine sandy loam and is very gravelly or very cobbly. It has 5 to 15 percent calcium carbonate accumulation with no observable accumulation."
