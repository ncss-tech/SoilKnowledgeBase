  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Signalhill series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits over residuum. These soils are on structural benches, dipslopes, fan remnants, escarpments, scarp slopes and landslides. Slopes are 3 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 8.3 degrees C.",
