Depth to the ortstein ranges from 6 to 15 inches, and ranges from 1 to 3 inches thick.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon.  The soil is saturated to the surface for 90 to 120 days when the soil temperature is above 5 degrees C.\nThe Oi horizon has a hue of 5YR to 10 YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1.  Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Oa horizon has neutral hue, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The E horizon is sand or fine sand.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bhsm horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3. The Bhsm horizons are sand or fine sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bs horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Some pedons have Bsm horizons with colors similar to Bs horizons. The Bs and Bsm horizons are sand or fine sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have BC horizons with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value and chroma of 5 or 6.  They are sand of fine sand.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sand or fine sand.
