Motoqua soils have weak to strong, medium or coarser prismatic structure and do not have a mollic epipedon that extends to bedrock. Phizphre soils have a mean annual soil temperature warmer than 50 degrees, do not have mollic epipedons that extend to bedrock, and have rock fragments of limestone. Slidymtn soils have an ustic aridic moisture regime and have rock fragments derived from andesite, rhyolite and related volcanic rocks."

The parent materials are slope alluvium and colluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist. At the type location the climate is semiarid continental. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 to 16 inches with a marked summer maximum. Frost-free season is 110 to 140 days. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F."
