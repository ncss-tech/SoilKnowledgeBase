The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.  The base saturation is 60 to 75 percent in the upper 30 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments of which 20 to 30 percent are cobbles and stones and 15 to 30 percent are gravel.  The particle-size control section averages 25 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 when moist and 3 or 4 when dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 when moist and dry.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 when moist and 4 to 6 when dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 when moist and dry.  It is loam and clay loam, with 25 to 35 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent of which 15 to 40 percent are cobbles and stones and 15 to 30 percent are gravel.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 when moist and 4 or 5 when dry, and chroma of 4 to 8 when moist and dry.  It is clay loam or clay, with 30 to 45 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent of which 0 to 15 percent are cobbles and stones and 35 to 45 percent are gravel."

Getaway soils are 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact and have a silt loam loess mantle over the argillic horizon.  Greystoke soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder throughout and are dry 45 to 80 consecutive days.  Jumbo soils have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches.  Smarts soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 40 to 46 degrees F.  Toncana soils have hue of 5YR to 2.5YR in the subsoil."

The soils formed in colluvium primarily from basalt and tuff.  The climate is cool and moist in winters and warm and dry in summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 28 to 32 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 30 to 50 days."
