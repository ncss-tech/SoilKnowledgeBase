  "OVERVIEW": "The Sherval series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in colluvium primarily from basalt and tuff.  Sherval soils are in concave areas on mountains.  Slopes are 5 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
