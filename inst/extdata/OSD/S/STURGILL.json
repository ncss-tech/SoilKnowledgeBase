  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are saturated many months of the year. The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F. The particle-size control section is 18 to 35 percent clay. The mollic epipedon is 14 to 22 inches thick and may include the upper part of the Bw horizon. Depth to moist value of 4 and chroma of 2 or less is 14 to 22 inches. There is an irregular decrease in organic carbon. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 0 or 1 moist and dry. Distinct or prominent redox concentrations as masses are common in the lower part of the A horizon or in the horizon immediately below. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the lower part of the A horizon with 18 to 35 percent clay.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 0, 1 or 2 moist and dry. It has distinct to prominent redox concentrations. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay.\nThe C1 horizon is silt loam and silty clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay. It has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.\nThe 2C2 and 3Ab horizons, when present, are at a depth of 30 inches or more. They are silt loam or silty clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay. Values are 3 to 6 moist, 4 to 8 dry, and chromas are 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe 3Cg horizon, when present, has gleyed colors of 5G or 5BG moist, and 5Y to 5GY when dry. It has similar textures to the 3Ab horizons."

The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 17 inches. The mean annual temperature of 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
