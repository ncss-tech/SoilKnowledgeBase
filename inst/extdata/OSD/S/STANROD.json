  "OVERVIEW": "The Stanrod series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately\nslowly permeable soils that are formed in mixed alluvium.  They are on\ncoalesced fan terraces and have slopes of 2 to 8 percent.  The average\nannual temperature is about 46 degrees F, the average annual\nprecipitation is about 10 inches.",
