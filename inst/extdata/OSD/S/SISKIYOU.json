  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry throughout the moisture control section for 60 to 90 days during the summer.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 56 degrees F.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches and the solum ranges from 12 to 20 inches thick.  The particle-size control section is coarse sandy loam or sandy loam with 8 to 12 percent clay and has 15 to 50 percent coarse and very coarse sand.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid.  The base saturation by ammonium acetate between 10 and 30 inches is 50 to 60 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is coarse sandy loam or sandy loam.  Gravel content is 10 to 25 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is coarse sandy loam or sandy loam.  Gravel content is 10 to 25 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 6 moist, 7 or 8 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  Some pedons have loamy coarse sand in the lower part.  Rock fragments are 10 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles; not exceeding a total of 35 percent in the B and C horizons."

Chaix soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 59 degrees F.  Dome, Gilligan, Steinmetz, Tethrick, Ulricher and Vader soils are over 40 inches deep.  Elwha soils are moderately well drained and have dense glacial till (Cr) at 20 to 40 inches.  Loper soils have more than 15 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Siskiyou soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes at elevations of 700 to 4,000 feet.  Slope gradients range from 20 to 90 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium or residuum weathered from granodiorite, quartz diorite or granite.  The summers are warm and dry, and winters are cool and moist with an annual precipitation of 35 to 60 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 200 days."

Engineering test data for the same sample is from the Engineering and Watershed Planning Unit in Portland.  The base saturation was sum of cations for this profile; when converted to ammonium acetate, the results verify Dystric placement.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
