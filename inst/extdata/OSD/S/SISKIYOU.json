  "OVERVIEW": "The Siskiyou series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from granitic bedrock.  Siskiyou soils are on uplands and have slopes of 20 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry throughout the moisture control section for 60 to 90 days during the summer.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 56 degrees F.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches and the solum ranges from 12 to 20 inches thick.  The particle-size control section is coarse sandy loam or sandy loam with 8 to 12 percent clay and has 15 to 50 percent coarse and very coarse sand.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid.  The base saturation by ammonium acetate between 10 and 30 inches is 50 to 60 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is coarse sandy loam or sandy loam.  Gravel content is 10 to 25 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is coarse sandy loam or sandy loam.  Gravel content is 10 to 25 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 6 moist, 7 or 8 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  Some pedons have loamy coarse sand in the lower part.  Rock fragments are 10 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles; not exceeding a total of 35 percent in the B and C horizons."
