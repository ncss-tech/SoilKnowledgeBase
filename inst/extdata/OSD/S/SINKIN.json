  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sinkin series consist of very deep, well drained to somewhat excessively well drained soils formed in very to extremely gravelly alluvium and colluvium over highly weathered clayey or very gravelly clayey residuum from dolomite. These nearly level soils occur in upland drainageways within the Ozark Highlands. Slopes range from 1 to 4 percent. The mean annual soil temperature is about 14 degrees Celsius. Mean annual precipitation is about 1143 millimeters.",
