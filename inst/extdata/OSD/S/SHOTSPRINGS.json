  "OVERVIEW": "The Shotsprings series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes.  They formed in mixed volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum from basalt. Slopes are 20 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
