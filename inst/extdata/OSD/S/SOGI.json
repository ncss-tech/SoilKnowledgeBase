  "REVDATE": "12/2005",
  "STATES": "AS,PB",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sogi series consists of moderately deep, well-drained soils on upland. These soils formed in volcanic ash and are underlain by hard tuff. Slope is 0 to 40 percent. Elevation is near sea level to 600 feet. The mean annual rainfall is about 140 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 80 degrees F.",
