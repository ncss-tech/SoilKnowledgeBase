  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is typically 20 to 40 inches, but is only 20 to 30 inches in many pedons.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 65 degrees F and rarely, if ever, is the soil temperature below 47 degrees F.  The soil between depths of about 8 to 25 inches usually is dry in all parts from about April until late November or mid-December, and usually is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.  Textures are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam and have less than 18 percent clay. The soils are slightly to violently effervescent throughout, but have less carbonates in the upper parts.  Some pedons do not have carbonates in the upper parts.  Carbonates are generally disseminated with few, if any, segregations other than in the underlying soft sandstone material.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/1, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/1, 7/2; 2.5Y 5/2, 6/4, 7/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4 and 6/3.  It has less than 1 percent organic matter in the upper 7 inches of soil.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/1, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/1, 7/2, 7/3 and 7/4; 2.5Y 6/2, 6/4 and 7/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 4/6, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6 and 6/3."

Balcom and Castaic soils have more than 18 percent clay. Cieneba and Trigo soils have a paralithic contact less than 20 inches below the surface.  Garretson soils lack a paralithic contact and have more than 18 percent clay.  Pollasky and Saugus soils are noncalcareous.  San Emigdio soils are stratified, have an irregular decrease in organic matter and lack a paralithic contact.  Shedd soils are fine-silty and have a chroma of less than 2."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  San Timoteo soils have 2 to 75 percent slopes and are on uplands at elevations of 300 to 3,500 feet.  They formed in material weathered from shale, sandstone and calcified weathered granite.  The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Annual precipitation (rainfall) is 9 to 20 inches.  The average January temperature is about 50 degrees F, average July temperature is about 75 degrees F, and the average annual temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 240 to 310 days."
