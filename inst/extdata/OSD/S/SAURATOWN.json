  "COMPETING SERIES": {

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Albemarle, Allegheny, Allenwood, Arcola, Arendstville, Aura, Bedington, Birdsboro, Brasstown, Bucks, Butano, Chester, Chetwynd, Chilmark, Clymer, Collington, Cowee, Edgemont, Edneytown, Elsinboro, Eubanks, Frankstown, Freehold, Gilpin, Gladstone, Glenelg, Junaluska, Leck Kill, Lonon, Meadowville, Murrill, Nixon, Pigeonroost, Pineville, Quakertown, Rayne, Shelocta, Shouns, Syenite, Tate, Thurmont, Ungers, and Whiteford soils in the same family.   Competing soils in closely related families are the Ashe, Chestnut, Ditney, Lilly, and Ranger series.\nNone of the competing series in the same family formed in residuum weathered from high-grade metamorphic rocks such as quartzite gneiss and schistose quartzite and contain fragments of those rocks, except for possibly Edneytown, Gladstone, and Pigeonroost soils.  Edneytown soils are deeper than 60 inches to bedrock, Gladstone soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock, and both soils may have thicker sola than Sauratown soils.  Pigeonroost soils have a paralithic contact and a Cr horizon at depths of 20 to 40 inches, and depth to a lithic contact is more than 40 inches.\nThe Ashe, Chestnut, Ditney, Lilly, and Ranger series in related families do not have an argillic horizon.  In addition, Ashe, Chestnut, and Lilly soils are coarse-loamy, and Ranger is loamy-skeletal."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sauratown soils are gently sloping to very steep and are on ridges and side slopes of the Southern Appalachian Mountains and the Sauratown Mountains.  Elevation ranges from 900 to 2700 feet.  Mean annual air temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches.  Slopes are typically 15 to 45 percent but range from 2 to 60 percent.  Sauratown soils formed in residuum weathered from high-grade metamorphic rocks such as quartzite gneiss and schistose quartzite."

Braddock, Hayesville, and Brevard soils are clayey.  Cleveland soils have bedrock at a depth of less than 20 inches.  Greenlee soils are loamy-skeletal.  Ashe, Chestnut, Cleveland, Edneytown, and Hayesville soils formed primarily in residuum and are on upland ridges and side slopes.  Braddock, Greenlee, Tate, and Brevard soils formed in colluvium and are in coves and on side slopes below rock outcrops."

Other common trees are white oak, scarlet oak, northern red oak, black oak, post oak, red maple, Virginia pine, Table Mountain pine, pitch pine, shortleaf pine, and eastern white pine.   The understory includes sourwood, flowering dogwood, blackgum, sassafras, blueberry, mountain laurel, and rhododendron.  A small acreage has been cleared of vegetation and large stones and used for tobacco, gardens, pasture, and hayland."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This series was mapped as the Hartsells series in the 1940 soil survey of Stokes County, North Carolina.  However, Hartsells is presently classified in the fine-loamy, siliceous, Typic Hapludults Family.  The 4/99 revision updates classification to the 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy.  This soil is placed in the subactive CEC activity class based upon lab data from North Carolina State University.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 12 inches (A, E, and BE horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 12 to 31 inches below the surface (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nLithic contact - the occurrence of hard bedrock at a depth of 31 inches (upper boundary of the R horizon)\nMLRA:  130             SIR:  NC0256\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
