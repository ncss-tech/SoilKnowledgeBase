  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 36 inches.  Combined thickness of the A and Bss horizons and depth to a duripan ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 62 degrees to 63 degrees F.  On drying, large cracks extend as deep as 48 inches or to the duripan and form large prisms.  The cracks open and close at least once each year and are open by June or July and are closed by October or November.  Common to many slickensides are at depths of about 12 to 48 inches.  These soils have a calcium to magnesium ratio of more than 2.0.\nThe A and Bss horizons are N3/0, N4/0, N5/0; 10YR 3/1, 4/1 or 5/1.  Moist color is N3/0, N2/0; 10YR 2/1 or 3/1.  Iron or manganese concretions are present in all pedons.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  In areas adjacent to streams or sloughs, there is an overwash of stratified fine sandy loam or silty clay loam.  It is 10YR 4/2, 4/3 or 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3 or 4/2.\nThe Bssk horizon is 10YR 4/1, 5/1, 5/2 or 6/2.  Moist color is 10YR 4/1, 4/2 or 5/2.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Texture is clay or silty clay in the upper part and clay loam or silty clay loam in the lower part.  It has segregations of accumulated lime in soft masses and seams.\nThe Bqkm horizon is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/4 or 5/6.  Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2 or 5/4.  It is strongly cemented in the laminar capping and weakly to strongly cemented in the underlying material.  It has segregations of accumulated lime as soft masses and seams."

Hildreth soils overlie unrelated material and have 7.5YR hues (see remarks).  Jacktone soils have a duripan at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Maxwell soils have a Ca/Mg ratio of 2 or less.  Subaco soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Willows soils are strongly alkaline and have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium in some or all parts."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stockton soils are in basins and in swales of level drainage ways.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 0 to 100 feet.  The soils formed in fine textured alluvium from mixed igneous and sedimentary rock sources.  The soils are in a dry subhumid climate of relatively hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Dense ground fog often occurs in the winter months.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 18 inches.  Mean January temperature is 45 degrees F; the mean July temperature varies from 77 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 60 to 61 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 260 to 280 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Stockton series was originally established in Stockton Area California Soil Survey Series 1939 issued May 1951.  The series was placed on the inactive list in 1963.  This reactivates the original series concept.  Hildreth soils are currently listed in the same family.   As currently described, Hildreth soils would not classify as Vertisols.   A part of the Hildreth soils may belong to another series or different subgroup.  More study of the Hildreth soils is needed to accurately classify these soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 29 inches (Ap, A, Bss1, Bss2 horizons)\nDuripan - the zone from 42 to 60 inches (Bqkm1, Bqkm2 horizons)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
