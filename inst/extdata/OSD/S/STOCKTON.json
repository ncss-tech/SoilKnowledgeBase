The mean annual soil temperature is 62 degrees to 63 degrees F.  On drying, large cracks extend as deep as 48 inches or to the duripan and form large prisms.  The cracks open and close at least once each year and are open by June or July and are closed by October or November.  Common to many slickensides are at depths of about 12 to 48 inches.  These soils have a calcium to magnesium ratio of more than 2.0.\nThe A and Bss horizons are N3/0, N4/0, N5/0; 10YR 3/1, 4/1 or 5/1.  Moist color is N3/0, N2/0; 10YR 2/1 or 3/1.  Iron or manganese concretions are present in all pedons.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  In areas adjacent to streams or sloughs, there is an overwash of stratified fine sandy loam or silty clay loam.  It is 10YR 4/2, 4/3 or 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3 or 4/2.\nThe Bssk horizon is 10YR 4/1, 5/1, 5/2 or 6/2.  Moist color is 10YR 4/1, 4/2 or 5/2.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Texture is clay or silty clay in the upper part and clay loam or silty clay loam in the lower part.  It has segregations of accumulated lime in soft masses and seams.\nThe Bqkm horizon is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/4 or 5/6.  Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2 or 5/4.  It is strongly cemented in the laminar capping and weakly to strongly cemented in the underlying material.  It has segregations of accumulated lime as soft masses and seams."

Subaco soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Willows soils are strongly alkaline and have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium in some or all parts."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Stockton series was originally established in Stockton Area California Soil Survey Series 1939 issued May 1951.  The series was placed on the inactive list in 1963.  This reactivates the original series concept.  Hildreth soils are currently listed in the same family.   As currently described, Hildreth soils would not classify as Vertisols.   A part of the Hildreth soils may belong to another series or different subgroup.  More study of the Hildreth soils is needed to accurately classify these soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 29 inches (Ap, A, Bss1, Bss2 horizons)\nDuripan - the zone from 42 to 60 inches (Bqkm1, Bqkm2 horizons)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
