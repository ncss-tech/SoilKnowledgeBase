  "OVERVIEW": "The Setnum series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from loess and basalt. Setnum soils are in depressions on plateaus and along drainages. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
