  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Strych soils are on fan piedmonts, highly dissected alluvial fans, fan remnants, hill toeslopes, and footslopes of cuestas, mesas, terraces, and escarpments on structural benches. Slopes are 1 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium from sandstone, shale, and conglomerate. Some areas have a mantle of basalt fragments up to boulder size as volcanic bombs on the soil surface and extending into the cambic horizon.  Elevations range from 4,500 to 9,000 feet. Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches. The precipitation is distributed evenly throughout the year with a slight increase in July, August, September, and October. The driest months are April, May and June. The freeze-free period is about 100 to 160 days. At elevations above 7,000 feet Strych soils are mainly on south facing slopes."
