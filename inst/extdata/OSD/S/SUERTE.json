  "OVERVIEW": "The Suerte series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian sediments.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on upland plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",

    "content": "REMARKS:  The series was formerly included in the Delfina series.  Delfina soils occur on different landscape positions, and are in sub MLRA 83D.\nAquic conditions occur at the interface between the A and Bt horizons for short periods of time following heavy or prolong periods of rain.  The period of saturation and reduction is insufficient to affect major soil interpretations.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: The zone from 15 to 35 inches.  (Bt horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 15 inches.  (A horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 15 to 80 inches.  (Bt horizons)\nRedoximorphic concentrations: 15 to 19 inches.  (Bt1 horizon)\nRedoximorphic depletions: 13 to 19 inches.  (A horizon)\nAbrupt textural change: At the upper boundary of the Bt1 horizon.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from Jim Wells County, Texas.\nTaxonomic version: Eighth edition of Soil Taxonomy, 1998"
