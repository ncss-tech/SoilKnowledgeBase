  "OVERVIEW": "This classification is tentative. Sawabe soils typically have dark grayish-brown granular Al horizons; light gray and light brownish-gray, massive A2 horizcns; brown, prismatic clay B2t horizons that have prismatic structure in their upper part and are calcareous and contain 15 percent exchangeable sodium percentage in their lower part and also in their duripans. The soils are slightly acid increasing to moderately alkaline.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to the duripan ranges from 10 to 19 inches. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 45 F., and mean summer soil temperature from 59 to 62 F. These soils are usually dry but are moist 1/4 of the time the soil temperature is 41 F. Mineralogy is montmorillonitic. They have nonclcareous upper sola that range in pH from 6.2 to 7.2. Their lower sola and duripan are weakly calcareous and range in pH from 7.6 to 8.6.  Color of the A1 horizons includes hues of 10YR, values of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chromas of 2. Color values are 5.5 dry after the surface 7 inches are mixed. Structure of the A1 horizons ranges from weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular or subangular blocky, or is massive. Consistence ranges from soft or slightly hard. Thickness of the A2 horizons ranges from 5 to 8 inches. Colors include hues of 10YR, values of 6 or 7 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chromas of 1 or 2. Common to many clean sand grains are present. Color of the B2t horizons includes hues of 7.5YR or 10YR, values of 5 or 4 dry or moist and chromas of 3 to 5. Structure ranges from strong, fine or medium, prismatic or colmnar.  If two parts of the B2t horizons are present, the structure of the lower part ranges from weak, fine or medium prismatic or moderate or strong, medium or coarse angular blocky. Texture is predominantly heavy clay, but clay may also occur. When the argillic horizon is mixed the weighted average clay content is 60 percent. Few to many, fine or medium lime segregations and laminae also occur. Structure of the lower B horizons.  Color of the duripan ranges widely and includes hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 5 or 7 dry and 5 or 6 moist, and chromas of 3 to 6. White lime segregations and laminae also occur.Structure of the upper 4 to 8 inches of the duripan ranges from moderate or strong, medium or thick platy, or is massive."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Fertaline series is the only other series classified in the same family at the present time. Fertaline soils differ by having 18 to 30 inch thick sola and depth to duripans. Catnip Millerlux soils are also similar but differ mainly in lacking indurated duripans but are underlain by hard bedrock. In addition Catnip soils have argillic horizons containing 60 percent clay."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICAL SETTING",

They have developed in loamy alluvium derived mainly from siliceous tuff with minor admixtures of basalt, andesite, rhyolite and volcanic ash.They occur at elevations of 6,000 to 7,000 feet in a cold continental climate having an average precipitation of 10 to 14 inches.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 41 to 44 F."
