These soils have a mean annual soil temperature of about 44 to 47 degrees F. and a mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches of about 59 to 64 degrees F.  The soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  The soils are noncalcareous to depths of 12 to 30 inches and are strongly to very strongly calcareous below these depths.\nThe upper 10 to 15 inches have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bt and Btk horizons have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Few mottles with hue of (5Y 8/3) and (5YR 8/2) occur in the lower part of the B horizon.  The Bt horizon is very gravelly sandy clay loam, very gravelly clay and very cobbly clay and has 35 to 45 percent clay.\nThe Bk horizon ranges from very gravelly and cobbly loamy sand, gravelly loam and very cobbly clay loam.  Some pedons have 5 to 15 percent stones throughout."
