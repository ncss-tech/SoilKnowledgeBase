  "OVERVIEW": "The Soulajule series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone and shale. Soulajule soils are on hills and have slopes of 9 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is 54 degrees to 58 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact of sandstone or shale is 20 to 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is about 52 degrees to 58 degrees F. The soil between the depths of 6 and 17 inches is usually dry in all parts from July until October and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year. Base saturation is less than 50 percent but never below 35 percent above the paralithic contact.  Clay content averages 35 to 50 percent in the particle-size control section.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6; 5YR 4/4; 5YR 3/4 or 4/4.  Gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent. This horizon is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe B2t horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 5/4, 6/6; 5YR 5/4, 5/6 or 7/8 and moist color of 5YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/4, 4/6 or 6/6. It is gravelly clay loam, gravelly clay, very gravelly clay loam or very gravelly clay.  Rock fragments are mostly gravel and range from 25 to 60 percent. This horizon is slightly acid or moderately acid."
