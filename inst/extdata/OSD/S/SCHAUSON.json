  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 22 to 40 inches thick and includes all or part of the argillic horizon.  The thickness of A and Bt horizons range from 19 to 46 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 42 to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F.  The soils are dry in parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days during the winter months, and are dry for 50 to 55 percent of the time when the soil temperature at 20 inches depth is more than 41 degrees F.\nThe A horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 to 4 moist, chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  Textures are sandy clay loam and clay loam.  This horizon averages 27 to 35 percent clay.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  It is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  Textures range from sandy clay loam to clay loam.  This horizon contains 0 to 5 percent rock fragments that are mainly pebble size.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Btb horizon does not occur in all pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bowbells, Center Creek, Detra, Flaxton, Hereford, and Hesperus series.  Bowbells, Flaxton, and Hereford soils are calcareous within the paritcle-size control section and have continuous horizons of visible calcium carbonate accumulation.  Center Creek soils have lithologic discontinuities and have mottles between 20 and 40 inches.  Detra and Hesperus soils are moist more than one half of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Schauson soils are on alluvial fans and valley plains.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium from basic and intermediate igneous rocks, mainly basalt.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches.  The precipitation is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year with 55 to 65 percent falling between April and September.  July, August and September are the wettest months with December and January being the driest.  Elevation is 7,300 to 8,500 feet.  The freeze-free period is 70 to 100 days."

Notter soils have 35 to 60 percent rock fragments below the argillic horizon and have a calcic horizon and are on higher parts of the fan.  Andys soils are calcareous throughout and have a calcic horizon.  Frandsen soils lack an argillic horizon.  Andys and Frandsen soils are on similar landscapes."
