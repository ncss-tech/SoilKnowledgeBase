  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 45 degrees F., and mean summer temperature is 62 degrees F.  The soils range from neutral to strongly alkaline in a majority of subhorizons within the solum.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent and conductivity ranges from 0 to 14 millimhos within the epipedon ant the argillic horizon.  Depth to coarse textured IIC horizons range from 10 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 10 to 40 inches.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate accumulation ranges from 12 to 40 inches but such are not strong enough to qualify as calcic or gypsic horizons.  The argillic horizon averages 35 to 70 percent fine or coarser sand.\nThe C horizon above a depth of 40 inches ranges in clay from 5 to 35 percent and in fine or coarser sand from 35 to 85 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in a major part of the solum and are dominantly 1 to 10 inches in diameter.  Hue ranges from 5Y through 75YR except that a few subhorizons having hue redder than 7.5YR occur discontinuously in some pedons and occupy less than half the thickness of the solum and C horizons above depth of 40 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

At the type location the average annual precipitation is 7 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer.  The average annual temperature is 41 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 61 degrees F."
