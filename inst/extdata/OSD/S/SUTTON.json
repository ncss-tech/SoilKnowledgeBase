  "OVERVIEW": "The Sutton series consists of very deep, moderately well drained loamy soils formed in melt-out till. They are nearly level to strongly sloping soils on hills, low ridges, and ground moraines, typically on footslopes, lower backslopes and in slight depressions. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high throughout. Mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C and mean annual precipitation is about 1205 mm.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 50 to 100 cm. Depth to bedrock is commonly more than 2 meters. Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent by volume to a depth of 100 cm and up to 50 percent below 100 cm. Except where the surface is stony, the fragments are mostly subrounded gravel and typically make up 60 percent or more of the total rock fragments. Unless limed, reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Disturbed pedons have an Ap horizon with value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4. The A or Ap horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak or moderate granular structure and is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon below the A horizon. It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture, structure, and consistence are like the A horizon.\nThe upper part of the Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 4 to 6.\nThe lower part of the Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y and value and chroma of 4 to 6. It has iron depletions and masses of iron accumulation above a depth of 60 cm. Fine-earth texture of the Bw horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam with less than 65 percent silt plus very fine sand. Structure is weak platy, granular, or subangular blocky, or the horizon is massive. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have a thin BC horizon with value and chroma like the lower part of the Bw horizon. The BC horizon has texture, structure, and consistence similar to the Bw horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It typically has redoximorphic features in the upper part. Texture is commonly fine sandy loam or sandy loam, but ranges to very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons have pockets or thin lenses of silt loam, loamy sand, or sand. The horizon is massive or it has weak plates. Consistence is commonly very friable or friable but the range includes firm in some pedons."

Wilbraham soils have low chroma iron depletions throughout the B horizon and have a dense substratum. Chautauqua and Wapping soils have more than 65 percent silt plus very fine sand in the B horizon. Pittstown and Woodbridge soils have a dense substratum. Pompton soils have a stratified sandy and gravelly substratum within a depth of 100 centimeters."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sutton soils are nearly level to strongly sloping soils typically on footslopes and lower backslopes or in slightly depressed areas on hills on glaciated uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed in acid melt-out till derived mainly from granite, gneiss, and/or schist. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 910 to 1800 mm. The frost-free period ranges from 140 to 240 days."

The well drained Charlton and the poorly drained Leicester soils are associated in a drainage sequence. Broadbrook, Essex, Montauk, and Paxton soils are well drained and have a dense substratum. Brookfield, Canton, Gloucester, and Narragansett soils are well drained and do not have redoximorphic features. Chatfield and Hollis soils have bedrock within a depth of 25 to 50 and 50 to 100 cm respectively. Ridgebury and Whitman soils are poorly drained and very poorly drained, respectively and have a dense substratum. Scituate soils are moderately well drained and have a dense substratum."
