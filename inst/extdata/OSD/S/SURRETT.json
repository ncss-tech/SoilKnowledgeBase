  "OVERVIEW": "The Surrett series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils formed in alluvium dominantly from limestone and quartzite on outwash fans and fan terraces.  Permeability is moderate above the pan and moderately rapid to rapid below the pan. Surrett soils have slopes of 2 to 20 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
