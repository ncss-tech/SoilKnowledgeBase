  "OVERVIEW": "The Shoken series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from granite.  These soils are on very steep convex mountain slopes.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
