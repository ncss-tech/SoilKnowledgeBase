  "OVERVIEW": "The Schiller series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in colluvium dominantly from granitic rocks. Slopes range from15 to 90 percent in foothills and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
