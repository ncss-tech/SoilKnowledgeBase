  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum thickness ranges from 36 to 102 cm (14 to 40 inches). The depth of a paralithic contact ranges from 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). The content of chert, dolomite, or shale fragments ranges from 0 to 20 percent in the solum, and from 1 to 35 percent in the C horizons. Reaction of the solum ranges from strongly acid through moderately alkaline, and in the C horizons from neutral to strongly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y; value of 3 through 6; and chroma of 1 through 6 but to a depth of 7 inches after mixing has chroma of 4 or more. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay with channery, parachannery or gravelly modifiers.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, 5BG, or 5GY; value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 through 6. Texture is silty clay or clay with channery, parachannery or gravelly modifiers.\nSome pedons have thin AB horizons 4 to 8 inches thick with the same colors of the Bt1 horizon and texture of silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or 5BG, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 6 or it is neutral and has value of 5 to 7. Texture is dominantly silty clay or clay with channery or parachannery modifiers. Some pedons have silty clay loam texture in the lower part of the profile."

Beasley, Bledsoe, Enott, and Heitt soils have a paralithic contact greater than 102 cm (40 inches). Brashear, Bucklick, Elba, Estate, Lowell, and Vandalia soils have a lithic contact greater than 102 cm (40 inches). Bratton, Caneyville, Donahue, Faywood, Fredonia, and Haggatt soils have lithic limestone at a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Bonnell, Cosperville, Heverlo, Jessup, Kewaunee, Milton, Mountpleasant, and Muncie soils have parts of the solum formed in glacial till.  Markland soils are formed in lacustrine sediments. Eden soils are formed in Ordivician age interbedded calcareous shales, siltstone and thin layers of limestone and contain more limestone fragments in the solum."
