These soils formed in glacial till of mixed mineralogy (including argillite, quartzite, and limestone), influenced by loess and volcanic ash. They occur on hills and hillslopes. They are in a continental climate. Mean annual temperature is 7.7 to 10.0 degrees C. Average annual precipitation is about 325 to 650 mm, and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."
