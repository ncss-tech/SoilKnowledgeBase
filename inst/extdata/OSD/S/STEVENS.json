  "OVERVIEW": "The Stevens series consists of moderately deep (to a densic horizon), well drained soils that formed in glacial till of mixed mineralogy (including argillite, quartzite, and limestone), influenced by loess and volcanic ash. Stevens soils are on hills and hillslopes. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 450 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.3 degrees C.",
