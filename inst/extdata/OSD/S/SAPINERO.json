(Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)\n01--4 to 2 inches; undecomposed organic material mainly needles, bark, twigs and leaves.\n02--2 to 0 inches; partially decomposed organic material like that of the horizon above.\nA2--0 to 10 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak thin platy structure that parts to very fine granules; slightly hard, very friable; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)\nA&B--10 to 20 inches; mixed light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and light brown (7.5YR 6/3) very stony loam (composite texture), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) and brown (7.5YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure that parts to fine granules; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; peds are hard, friable; this horizon consists of seams and nodules of clayey material like that of the underlying horizon embedded in a lighter colored matrix like that of the overlying horizon; 60 percent stones; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

(10 to 16 inches thick)\nIIC--35 to 60 inches; fragmental deposits of highly fractured rhyolite or rhyolitic tuff.  Horizon consists principally of flagstones overlapping one another but with 1 to 2 inch cracks between the rocks that are not completely filled with fine materials."

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are noncalcareous throughout.  Thin Al horizons are present in some pedons.  The B2t horizon typically extends to the IIC horizon but nonfragmental C horizons occur in some pedons.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent in all subhorizons of the argillic horizon.  Depth to the fragmental IIC horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the top of the argillic horizon is less than 24 inches, and depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 17 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 75 percent in a major part of the solum and are mainly flagstones ranging from 10 to 40 inches in diameter.  The solum ranges from medium acid to neutral.  The mean annual soil temperature is 37 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 45 degrees F., with an 0 horizon at least 4 inches thick.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma 1 through 4.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically very stony loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam and the fine earth fraction has 18 to 35 percent clay, 10 to 50 percent silt, and 20 to 65 percent sand with more than 15 percent being fine or coarser sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Sapinero soils are on mesa tops and ridges.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 40 or more percent.  The soils formed in very stony parent materials weathered residually from highly fractured rhyolite or rhylolitic tuff or colluvial deposits of such rock.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 16 inches, with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the spring and summer.  The mean annual temperature is 34 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 45 degrees F."
