  "OVERVIEW": "The Sapinero series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and/or colluvium derived from highly fractured rhyolite or rhylolitic tuff.  These soils are on mesa tops and ridges. Slopes are 2 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 410 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.",
