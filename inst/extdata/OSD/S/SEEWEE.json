Depth to the Bh horizon ranges from 18 to 30 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The A and Ap horizons are loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Pedons that have an E horizon with chroma of 2 have a layer in the E horizon with chroma of 3 or more.  The E horizon is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or fine sand.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It does not turn redder in ignition.  The Bh horizon is fine sand or sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4, commonly with mottles in shades of brown or yellow. Some pedons are mottled in the above colors.  The C horizon is fine sand or sand."

Similar soils in other families are the Baratari, Echaw, Leon, Lynn Haven, Olustee, Mascotte, Ridgeland, Rosedhu, Seagate, and Witherbee series.  Baratari soils have an E horizon with chroma 2 or less.  Echaw, Leon, Lynn Haven, Mascotte, Olustee, Seagate, and Witherbee soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Mascotte, Olustee, and Seagate soils have an argillic horizon beneath the Bh horizon. Ridgeland soils do not have an E horizon.  Rosedhu soils have an umbric epipedon."
