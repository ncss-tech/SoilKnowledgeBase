  "OVERVIEW": "The Surfaz series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in outwash derived from quartzite and sedimentary rocks.  Surfaz soils are on outwash terraces and outwash fans.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The changes in textures, the change to siliceous mineralogy and CEC activity class were based on this laboratory data.\nTaxonomic version:  Seventh Edition, 1996.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
