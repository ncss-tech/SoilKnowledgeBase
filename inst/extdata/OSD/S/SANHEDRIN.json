The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from sandstone shale and siltstone at elevations of 490 meters to 1525 meters (600 to 5,000 feet).  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation varies from 1000 to 1520 millimeters (40 to 60 inches) including 0 to 30 inches snowfall.  Mean January temperature is 4 degrees C (40 degrees F); mean July temperature is 21 degrees C (70 degrees F); mean annual air temperature is 9 to 14 degrees C (48 to 58 degrees F).  Frost-free season ranges from 120 to 200 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Sanhedrin soils were formerly classified as Ultic Argixerolls.  Classification was changed due to base saturation less than 50 percent in the argillic horizon. This soil was revised in February 2008 due to the presence of bedrock with cracks mostly closer together than 10 centimeters and coatings on the rock fragments.  The soil lacks a lithic contact (ET).\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL Pedon S79CA-045-116\nSoil classified using Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 11th edition\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
