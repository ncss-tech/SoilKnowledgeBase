  "OVERVIEW": "The Sly series consists of very deep, well drained soils on dissected terraces and structural benches in canyons. They formed in loess deposits with minor amounts of volcanic ash overlying basalt. Permeability is moderately slow. Slopes are 3 to 50 percent. The average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 32 inches.",
