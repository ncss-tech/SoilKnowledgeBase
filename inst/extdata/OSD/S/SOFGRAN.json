  "REVDATE": "12/2006",
  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sofgran series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rock.  Sofgran soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
