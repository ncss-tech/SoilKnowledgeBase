  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sofgran soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on footslope and backslope positions.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 8,000 to 10,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 55 inches, mean annual temperature is 36 to 39 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
