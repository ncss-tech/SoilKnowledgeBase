  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The series control section typically is silt loam, but is silty clay loam in some pedons.  Thickness of mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to more than 60 inches.  Greatest accumulations of salts other than gypsum typically are in the A horizon.  Electrical conductivity of the saturation extract ranges from 4 to 16 mmhos in the upper 20 inches and from 3 to 10 mmhos or more below depths of 20 inches.  The soil typically has a Bz horizon in the upper B horizon and a Bk horizon in the lower part.\nThe A horizon has 10YR, 2.5Y, and 5Y hue, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or less.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe B horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 2 to 4 and 3 to 6 dry; and chroma of 0 to 2.  It typically has few to common distinct and prominent mottles in the lower part.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It typically has the greatest amount of salts in the upper part (Bz horizon) and the content decreases with depth.  Accumulations of carbonates and gypsum typically are greatest in the lower part (Bk and Bky horizon).  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have Byz or Byg horizons.\nThe Cg horizon is neutral or is 2.5Y or 5Y hue, value of 2 to 5 and 3 to 7 dry, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It typically has few to many medium distinct or prominent mottles, however, some pedons lack mottles but have matrix chroma of 1 or less.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Crystals and nests of gypsum and other salts in the Cg horizon range widely in size and amount.  The Cg horizon below depths of 40 inches commonly is silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay, but some pedons contain strata of loam or silt loam.  Loose sand and gravel are at depths of 40 to 60 inches in some pedons."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Badus, Calco, Devilsgait, Lamo, Obert, and Wingdale series in the same family.  Badus, Calco, Devilsgait, Lamo, Obert, and Wingdale soils contain less visible salts throughout. In addition, Devilsgait, and Wingdale soils are drier in the soil moisture control section in May and June."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Salmo soils are on level flood plains that have higher water tables.  Slope gradients are less than 1 percent.  The soils formed in silty alluvium.  Climate is subhumid.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 26 inches."

Clamo soils contain more clay in the control section. Alcester and Bon soils are better drained and on higher positions.  Alcester soils are leached of carbonates to greater depths and do not have visible salts."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained and somewhat poorly drained.  Surface runoff is slow or very slow.  Permeability is moderate or moderately slow in the solum and moderately slow or slow in the underlying material.  The water table is near the surface in the spring and at depths of 2 to 4 feet in the fall.  Salmo soils are flooded during periods of above average rainfall."
