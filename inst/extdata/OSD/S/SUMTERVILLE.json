  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A and E horizons and from strongly acid to neutral in the Bt horizon.  Boulders occur randomly at or near the surface and within the upper pedon at intervals of about 30 to 80 feet and cover 0.01 to 1.0 percent of the soil surface.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4 or less.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, brown, and red range from none to common.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Iron accumulations in shades of yellow, brown, and red range from few to common.  Texture is sandy clay or sandy clay loam.  When it is sandy clay loam, thickness is less than 5 inches.\nWhere present, the C horizon has colors that are similar to the lower Btg horizon.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam."

Adamsville soils are on similar to lower positions, do not have argillic horizons, and are sandy throughout.  The moderately well drained Millhopper soils are on higher positions, have sandy layers 40 to 80 inches in thickness, and are Ultisols.  The poorly drained Paisley soils are on lower positions, have an argillic horizon within a depth of 20 inches, and have clayey, smectitic subsoils."
