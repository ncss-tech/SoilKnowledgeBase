  "OVERVIEW": "The Sumpley series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained\nsoils on flood plains.  They formed in mixed alluvium with\nan influence of loess and volcanic ash in the surface\nhorizons.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual\nprecipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual\ntemperature is about 43 degrees F.",
