  "OVERVIEW": "The Stutts series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on outwash plains, moraines, lake plains, and deltas.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the loamy part and high or very high in the sandy part. They formed in loamy eolian or glaciolacustrine deposits over sandy glaciofluvial deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent.",
