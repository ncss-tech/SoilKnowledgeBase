  "OVERVIEW": "The Sinnice series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in layers of aerially deposited volcanic ash and pumice.  They are on backslopes and ridgetops of mountains at elevations of 2,800 to 5,000 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 38 to 43 degrees F and the mean summer soil temperature is less than 47 degrees F.  The soils are dry for less than 45 consecutive days after the summer solstice.  All pumice fragments are very weakly to moderately cemented (para).  The soil profile has over 60 percent glass throughout all horizons.  The 15-bar water content on air-dry samples is 3 to 10 percent throughout all horizons.  Depth to the 2Bw is 8 to 17 inches.  Depth to the base of the 2Bw is 14 to 36 inches.  The A and BE horizons have phosphate retention of 25 to 35 and acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron of 0.4 to 1.0.  The 2Bw horizons have phosphate retention of 35 to 50 and acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron of 0.4 to 1.0.  The particle-size control section is ashy-pumiceous over ashy over pumiceous with the contrasting parts typically being the ashy (2Bw) and the pumicenous (3C) but some pedons may quality as ashy-pumiceous over ashy.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe BE horizon has stains with a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 3 through 8 moist and dry.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 7 dry, and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and dry.  Only the upper 2 to 4 inches may lack mollic colors.  It is stratified fine sandy loam, sandy loam, and loamy sand.  Pumice fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.  It is 8 to 19 inches thick and averages 3 to 5 percent organic carbon.\nThe 3C horizon has 65 to 80 percent pumice and 5 to 15 percent pebbles.  Stains have hue 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 3 through 8 moist and dry."

Sinnice soils formed in layers of aerially deposited volcanic ash and pumice.   Beginning at the surface of the mineral soil, the stratigraphy of pyroclastic material from Mt. St. Helens in Sinnice soil profiles is (1) fresh ash and pumice of the 176-year-old \"Layer T\", (2) ash of the 400-year-old \"Layer X\", and (3) pumice of the 400-year- old \"Layer W\".  Some pedons now have a deposit of 1980 St. Helens ash and pumice.  The climate is characterized by cool, moist summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 115 to 135 inches.  Average January temperature is 24 degrees F., the average July temperature is 58 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 75 to 90 days."
