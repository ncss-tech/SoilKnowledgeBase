  "OVERVIEW": "The Starhope series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and residuum from andesite, basalt, latite, or welded tuff.  Starhope soils are on basalt plains, foothills and mountainsides and have slopes of 1 to 60 percent.  Permeability is slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
