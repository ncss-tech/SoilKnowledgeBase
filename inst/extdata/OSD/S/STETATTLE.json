  "OVERVIEW": "The Stetattle series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with colluvium and reworked glacial drift on debris aprons, valley walls, and debris cones.  Slopes are 15 to 40 percent on debris cones and debris aprons and 40 to 90 percent on valley walls.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,800 millimeters.  The mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.",

Triumph soils lack andic soil properties and form on the more active portions of the same landforms or on areas controlled by water erosion on the same landforms."
