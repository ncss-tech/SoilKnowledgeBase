These soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with reworked glacial drift and colluvium.  The climate consists of cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,800 to 3,300 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 5 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 30 to 60 days."

Doubtful soils lack melanic soil colors or organic carbon percentages that meet melanic requirements and form on the same landforms under coniferous vegetation.  Triumph soils lack andic soil properties and form on the more active portions of the same landforms or on areas controlled by water erosion on the same landforms."
