    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Afton, Catherine, Clementine, Colo, Humansville, Otter, Pastolla, and Whitewood series. Afton soils are in upland drainageways at elevations higher than 305 meters (1000 feet), and are generally in cooler and wetter climates (see Remarks). Catherine, Clementine, and Whitewood soils are dry in the moisture control section for more than 30 cumulative days out of the 120 days following the summer solstice. Colo soils have mollic epipedons more than 36 inches (91 cm) in thickness. Humansville soils have mean annual soil temperature greater than 13 degrees C (55 degrees F). Otter soils average less than 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Pastolla soils are less acid in the A horizon and do not have a cambic horizon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Sawmill soils are on flood plains and valley floors, and in some drainageways that extend into the uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Sawmill soils formed in alluvial sediments from drift thought to be of Wisconsin Age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.2 to 13.9 degrees C (45 to 57 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 760 to 1140 mm (30 to 45 inches). Frost-free period is 140 to 190 days. Elevation is 104 to 305 meters (340 to 1,000 feet) above mean sea level."

All of these soils are in similar positions on the flood plain, but the somewhat poorly drained Lawson and Tice soils are on slightly higher positions or are closer to the stream channel. Beaucoup and Tice soils have mollic epipedons less than 61 cm (24 inches) thick. Wabash and Zook soils average more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained and very poorly drained. Where drained, these soils have an apparent seasonal high water table 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1.0 foot) below the surface at some time between January and May in most years. In undrained conditions, the apparent seasonal high water table is 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 foot) below the surface at some time between November and June in most years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate. Flooding is rare to frequent for brief to long periods between November and June."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Many areas of Sawmill soils are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, and meadow are the principal crops. Undrained areas are mostly used for pasture or woodland. Native vegetation is grasses and trees. See Additional Data section for native vegetative cover in Iowa and Minnesota."
