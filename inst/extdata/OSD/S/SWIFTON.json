  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Coarse fragments in the upper 3 or 4 feet range from very few up to 35 percent, mostly pebble and cobble size but with some stones. A higher percentage of coarse material is common below 4 feet and in some pedons there is shale or sandstone bedrock below 5 feet. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F.  and average winter soil temperature ranges from 31 to 33 degrees F.  under a heavy blanket of snow. There is a thin (l to 3 inches thick) Al horizon between the forest litter and the A2 horizon in some pedons. The A2 horizon may be uniformly light gray to depths 15 or 20 inches but more commonly has a subhorizon that is stronger in chroma and lower in value. This stronger chroma may continue into the B2t horizon but commonly grays out again above the B2t horizon. The B2t horizon occurs at depths ranging from 24 to 60 inches below the surface and has clay content ranging from 25 to 35 percent. It is usually 2 to 3 feet thick and grades into the C horizon material which is lighter in color and contains less clay."
