The Bitton soils do not have a calcic horizon and do not have a lithological discontinuity at a depth of 10 to 20 inches.  The Datino soils have lime at a depth of 7 inches, and the rock fragments are mainly cobbles below a depth of 7 inches and do not have a lithological discontinuity.  Grousecreek soils are medium acid to neutral throughout and do not have a calcic or Bk horizon.  Heely soils are moderately deep over schist.  The Labra soils do not have a lithological discontinuity above a depth of 10 to 20 inches; also, the coarse fragments are channers derived from burnt coal seams.  Perma soils do not have a calcic horizon and are noncalcareous throughout.  Peso soils are lithic below a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Pesowyo and Veatch soils are moderately deep.  Sandia soils do not have a calcic horizon, have more than 50 percent stones and cobbles in the control section and do not have a lithological discontinuity above a depth of 40 inches.  Slimbutte soils do not have a lithological discontinuity above a depth of 40 inches and have more than 20 percent rock fragments, mainly cobble size above a depth of 20 inches.  Wanagan soils do not have a calcic horizon."

The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, most of which falls during the spring and early summer.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 125 days."
