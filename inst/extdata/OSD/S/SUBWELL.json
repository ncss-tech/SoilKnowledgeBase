The Bitton soils do not have a calcic horizon and do not have a lithological discontinuity at a depth of 10 to 20 inches.  The Datino soils have lime at a depth of 7 inches, and the rock fragments are mainly cobbles below a depth of 7 inches and do not have a lithological discontinuity.  Grousecreek soils are medium acid to neutral throughout and do not have a calcic or Bk horizon.  Heely soils are moderately deep over schist.  The Labra soils do not have a lithological discontinuity above a depth of 10 to 20 inches; also, the coarse fragments are channers derived from burnt coal seams.  Perma soils do not have a calcic horizon and are noncalcareous throughout.  Peso soils are lithic below a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Pesowyo and Veatch soils are moderately deep.  Sandia soils do not have a calcic horizon, have more than 50 percent stones and cobbles in the control section and do not have a lithological discontinuity above a depth of 40 inches.  Slimbutte soils do not have a lithological discontinuity above a depth of 40 inches and have more than 20 percent rock fragments, mainly cobble size above a depth of 20 inches.  Wanagan soils do not have a calcic horizon."
