  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Swainslough soils are on backswamps, depressions, low-flood-plain steps, reclaimed salt marshes, and tidal marshes on alluvial plains near the Pacific Ocean. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. Elevation is 0 to 50 meters (0 to 160 feet). The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 890 to 2030 millimeters (35 to 80 inches). Mean annual air temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). The mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C. The mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C. The frost free season is about 275 to 330 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arlynda, Occidental, Weott, and Worswick soils. The Occidental soils have a water table at or near the surface for longer periods and occur on reclaimed tidal marshes. Arlynda soils have less than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section and occur on backswamps, depressions, meander scars and low-flood-plain steps. Weott soils are in a fine-silty family and occur on higher positions than Swainslough.  The Worswick soils are in a coarse-loamy family and occur on backswamps adjacent to natural levees."

The soils are occasionally flooded for brief periods December through February. The soils are frequently ponded 1 to 15 centimeters for long periods December through March. Some areas are partially drained by ditches and protected by tide gates."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Swainslough soils were proposed in May of 2001 as fine, mixed, nonacid, mesic Fluvaquentic Endoaquepts.  Reclassification to fine, mixed, superactive, nonacid, isomesic Fluvaquentic Endoaquepts is based on changes in Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Ninth edition, and temperature data recorded in the survey area 2001 through 2004.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 30 centimeters (Oi, A horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 30 to 165 centimeters.  (Bg1, Bg2, Bg3, and Bg4 horizons)\n3. Particle-size control section - the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters averages 36 percent clay, and 12 percent fine sand and coarser (A, Bg1, Bg2, Bg3, and Bg4 horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: University of California sample 64-CA-12-008 was collected from the 1964 type location (Soils of Western Humboldt County 1965), sampled as Bayside.\nNASIS User Pedon ID: 88CA600048\nSoil classified using Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 12th edition.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
