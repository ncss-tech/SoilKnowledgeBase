Cedargrove soils are dry for 60 to 90 days and have an ochric epipedon. Cornutt soils have a Ca/Mg ratio of more than 1, have hue of 5YR or 2.YR in the subsoil and are deep to bedrock.  Freezener soils have dominant hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the argillic horizon  and are dry for 60 to 90 days.  Greengulch, Mildred, and Oakland soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Jumpoff soils are moderately well drained and have hue of 5Y or 2.5Y in the argillic horizon.  Oak Grove soils have an umbric epipedon and are dry for 60 to 80 days.  Rainier soils are moderately well drained and have a lithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Veneta soils have more than 60 percent clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sweetbriar soils are on mountain sideslopes.  Elevation ranges from 800 to 3,000 feet.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from ash-flow tuffs, flow basalts, flow breccia and metasediments.  Slopes are 3 to 60 percent. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 35 to 60 inches.  The frost-free period is 100 to 170 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon- the zone from the surface of the mineral soil to a depth of approximately 18 inches.  (A1, A2 and Bt1 horizons)\nArgillic horizon- the zone from approximately 8 to 60 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, Bt5, and Bt6 horizons)\nParticle-size control section- from 8 to 28 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2, and part of the Bt3 horizons) with estimated clay content of 45 percent.\nUltic intergrade- base saturation is assumed to be 35 to 60 percent throughout the argillic horizon, decreasing with depth.  (Thus the soil is not a Mollisol)\nMollic intergrade- color value of 3 moist in the A horizon with more than 0.7 percent organic carbon.\nPlacement into Haploxeralfs is based on the modal profile.  Areas of this soil that have hue of 7.5YR and chroma of more than 4 in the matrix of the argillic horizon would qualify as Palexeralfs.  This problem exists in many of the series of Ultic Haploxeralfs.  A change is needed in the keys to address this problem; recommend changing hue to be redder than 7.5YR instead of redder than 10YR\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added to the classification in 10/2005. The competing series section was not updated at that time. Last revision 3/1995.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
