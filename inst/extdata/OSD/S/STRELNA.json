    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained runoff is high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high above the permafrost and very low in the permafrost. Fire or clearing removes the insulating organic mat and results in lowering of the permafrost level.  Textural variability in thawed substratums results in extreme variability in permeability rates."
