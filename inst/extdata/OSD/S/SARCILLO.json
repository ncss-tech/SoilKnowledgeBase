  "OVERVIEW": "The Sarcillo series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Sarcillo soils are on ridges and hills and have slopes of 2 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
