The thickness of the volcanic ash mantle having andic soil properties is 14 to 30 inches. The upper part of the particle-size control section contains 60 to 80 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate and 0.4 to 1.0 percent acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron. The lower part contains 30 to 40 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate and less than 0.4 percent acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron. The 15-bar moisture is 8 to 12 percent on dried samples throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 to 5 dry. It has 15 to 30 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist, 3 or 4 dry. It has 20 to 50 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones. Field estimated clay is 10 to 20 percent.

The soil formed in colluvium from rhyolite and andesite with volcanic ash surface layers. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 35 inches. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."

Segundo soils are loamy-skeletal without a volcanic ash influenced surface and are on south slopes. Tolo soils are ashy over loamy and are mapped in complex with Stices on gentle slopes."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nAndic properties - from 1 to 22 inches meeting the criteria for andic properties (2a).\nParticle-size control section - from 1 to 41 inches with the upper part (A, Bw1, Bw2) meeting andic properties and less than 12 percent 15-bar moisture (dried sample) and the lower part (2C1) having more than 30 percent glass and less than 12 percent 15-bar moisture. The zone from 1 to 4 inches qualifies for ashy; the zone from 4 to 60 inches qualifies as ashy-skeletal. The ashy-skeletal class is based on the thickest part of the particle-size control section.\nCambic horizon - the zone from 4 to 22 inches. (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)\nOchric epipedon - the A horizon that is too thin to be mollic.\nClassification revised 7/04 based on error in placement of family particle-size class into contrasting ashy-skeletal over loamy-skeletal. With greater than 30 percent volcanic glass throughout, a contrasting class is not possible.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
