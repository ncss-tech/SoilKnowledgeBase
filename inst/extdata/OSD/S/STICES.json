  "OVERVIEW": "The Stices series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountainous areas. They formed in colluvium from rhyolite and andesite and have a surface that formed from volcanic ash. Slopes are 35 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The thickness of the volcanic ash mantle having andic soil properties is 14 to 30 inches. The upper part of the particle-size control section contains 60 to 80 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate and 0.4 to 1.0 percent acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron. The lower part contains 30 to 40 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate and less than 0.4 percent acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron. The 15-bar moisture is 8 to 12 percent on dried samples throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 to 5 dry. It has 15 to 30 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist, 3 or 4 dry. It has 20 to 50 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones. Field estimated clay is 10 to 20 percent. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.

The zone from 1 to 4 inches qualifies for ashy; the zone from 4 to 60 inches qualifies as ashy-skeletal. The ashy-skeletal class is based on the thickest part of the particle-size control section.\nCambic horizon - the zone from 4 to 22 inches. (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)\nOchric epipedon - the A horizon that is too thin to be mollic.\nClassification revised 7/04 based on error in placement of family particle-size class into contrasting ashy-skeletal over loamy-skeletal. With greater than 30 percent volcanic glass throughout, a contrasting class is not possible.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
