  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Schnebly series consists of well drained, moderately deep, fine textured Reddish Brown soils formed in reddish clayey residuum from basalt.  They are on hillsides and colluvial slopes with grass-shrub vegetation.  Schnebly soils form at elevations of about 4,000 feet in areas with continental climate characterized by average annual precipitation of about 13 inches and mean annual temperature of about 60 degrees F.  Slopes are 5 to 20 percent.",
