Holsine soils have extremely  gravelly A and C1 horizons over unconformable lacustrine sediments at 12 inches.  Lariat, Malm, and Nargon soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Lidy soils have sand and gravel at depths of 23 to 34 inches. Matheson soils are very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the particle-size control section and the depth to the calcic horizon is 11 to 20 inches.  Voltage soils lack very gravelly or extremely gravelly textures in the lower part of the particle-size control section."
