  "OVERVIEW": "The Sparmo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed  in glacial outwash and alluvium.  Sparmo soils are on outwash fans, fan terraces, and stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the  average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
