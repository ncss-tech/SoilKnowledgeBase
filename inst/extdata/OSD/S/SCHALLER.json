It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loamy fine sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam to gravelly coarse sand.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, sand or loamy sand containing 2 to 35 percent gravel.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline."
