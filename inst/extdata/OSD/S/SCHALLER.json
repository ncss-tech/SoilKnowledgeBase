  "REVDATE": "10/98",
  "STATES": "ND",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Schaller series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapid or very rapidly permeable soils formed in sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial deposits.  These soils are on outwash terraces, terrace escarpments and eskers.  Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 16 inches.",

The mollic epipedon typically is 7 to 9 inches thick, but ranges to 16 inches in thickness where texture is loamy fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loamy fine sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam to gravelly coarse sand.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, sand or loamy sand containing 2 to 35 percent gravel.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline."
