  "OVERVIEW": "The Silvermine series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. The Silvermine soils are on fan aprons and alluvial fans over fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C.",

Daisy soils have greater than 50 cm of sands overlying an argillic horizon and have a calcic horizon, but no duripan. These soils also have a loamy particle size control section. Gravesumit soils are coarse-loamy throughout the particle size control section, have argillic and calcic horizons and do not have a duripan."
