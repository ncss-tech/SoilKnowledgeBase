Elevations range from 914 to 1037 meters. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters; mean annual air temperature is 17 to 20 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."

However, Noagua soils have an argillic horizon above the duripan, are coarse-loamy throughout the particle size control section and are moderately deep. Daisy soils have greater than 50 cm of sands overlying an argillic horizon and have a calcic horizon, but no duripan. These soils also have a loamy particle size control section. Gravesumit soils are coarse-loamy throughout the particle size control section, have argillic and calcic horizons and do not have a duripan."
