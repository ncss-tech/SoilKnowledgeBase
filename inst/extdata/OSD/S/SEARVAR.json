  "OVERVIEW": "The Searvar series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks.  Searvar soils are on plateaus and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
