  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Searvar soils are on plateaus and hills.  These soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as tuff-breccia.  They typically occur on summit positions.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,800 to 6,500 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  Total snowfall is 12 to 30 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is about 27 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 66 degrees F.   The frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
