  "OVERVIEW": "The Shack series consists of moderately well drained, very deep soils on uplands. These soils formed in residium from dominantly cherty limestone. Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 53 inches.",
