Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid, except surface horizons which have been limed. Clay content of the control section ranges from 20 to 35 percent and silt ranges from 30 to 55 percent. Chert content ranges from 15 to 35 percent in all horizons. Depth to horizons with 40 to 60 percent brittle properties ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or 10YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 1, 2, 3, or 4. It is cherty silt loam, cherty loam or cherty sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or 10YR; value of 5 or 6; and chroma of 2, 3, 4, or 6. It is cherty silt loam, cherty loam, or cherty sandy loam.\nThe Bt1 and Bt2 horizons have hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR; value of 5 or 6; and chroma of 4, 6, or 8. The Bt1 horizon is cherty clay loam, cherty silty clay loam, or cherty silt loam. The Bt2 horizon is cherty clay loam, cherty silty clay loam, or cherty loam.\nThe Btx horizons are mottled with shades of red, brown, yellow, and gray. Gray colors are more than 30 inches below the surface. The Btx1 has as much as 10 to 50 percent brittle properties and the Btx2 has 40 to 60 percent brittle properties. They are cherty clay loam, cherty silty clay loam, or cherty loam.\nThe B't horizons have hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4, 5, or 6; and chroma of 4, 6, or 8 with few to many mottles in shades of red, gray, brown, or yellow or are mottled in these shades.

Tasso soils have less than 15 percent coarse fragments above the fragipan. Allen, Minvale, and Smithdale soils have reddish upper Bt horizons and lack fragic properties. Ardilla, Bowie, Carnegie, and Cowarts soils have more than 5 percent plinthite. Bodine soils contain from 35 to 90 percent by\nvolume of chert. Cedarbluff soils are somewhat poorly drained. Etowah and Holston soils have less than 15 percent coarse fragments. Leesburg soils lack horizons that are compact and brittle in parts of some horizons."
