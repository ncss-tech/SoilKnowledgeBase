Carbonates are typically at the surface or are at the surface if the upper 18 cm (7 inches) is mixed. Rock fragments of mixed lithology range from 2 to 10 percent by volume throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam or silt loam. It has 1 to 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 30 percent. It is loam or clay loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loam or clay loam. The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 20 percent. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It is friable or firm based on the geomorphic surface it occurs on."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 585 to 890 mm (23 to 35 inches). Frost-free period ranges from 155 to 200 days. Elevation ranges from 213 to 479 m (700 to 1,570 feet) above sea level."

The well drained Annton, Amiret, Clarion, Omsrud and Ves soils are on less convex sideslopes and low rises and knolls. The somewhat poorly drained Crippin, Nicollet, and Walnut Grove soils are on lower lying, less sloping areas. The poorly drained Delft, Pell Creek (P), and Webster soils are on adjacent flats or drainageways. The well drained Storden soils are on the sharply convex knolls and ridges."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - zone from surface to a depth of 23 cm (9 inches) (Ap horizon); calcic horizon - the zone from 23 to 94 cm (9 to 37 inches) (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons); udic moisture regime. These soils formerly were included with mapping units of Clarion and Storden soils. The series concept now has soil saturation in the lower third of the series control section on slopes up to 6 percent. A new series called Belview has been established to replace Swanlake soils that do not have saturation in the lower third of the series control section and are on higher slopes.\nCurrently, a firm clay loam till C horizon is associated with the Gary moraine in Minnesota.  A friable loam till C horizon is associated with the Bemis and Altamont moraines in Minnesota.  A glacial till study and distribution of similar soils by geomorphic areas in Minnesota is needed to more accurately characterize this series by landform.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Soil Interpretation record numbers MN0142-moderate permeability; MN0317-moderately slow permeability. Central File Code Nos. 2103 for some data on the typical pedon and to 2104 and 2105 for data on two additional pedons. Soil Interpretation Record number MN0300.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
