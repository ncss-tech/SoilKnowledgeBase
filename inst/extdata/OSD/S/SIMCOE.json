  "OVERVIEW": "The Simco series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and basalt and minor amounts of volcanic ash.  Simcoe soils are on uplands.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to basalt ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 48 to 54 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches thick.  The argillic horizon averages 25 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand.  The particle size control section averages 0 to 15 percent coarse fragments.\nThe Ap and A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2, 3 or 4 dry.  It has weak or moderate structure.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is heavy silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam, and has weak to moderate blocky or prismatic structure and thin to moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and in pores.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B3 or C horizons have hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  They are clay loam, and may be gravely or cobbly below a depth of 35 inches.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline."

Bjork soils are mildly alkaline in the B2t horizon, have schist or gneiss rock fragments in the particle size control section and are underlain by schist or gneiss at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Dodes soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Indiano soils have 15 to 35 percent rhyolitic or altered volcanic rock fragments in the particle size control section."
