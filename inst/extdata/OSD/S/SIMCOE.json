  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to basalt ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 48 to 54 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches thick.  The argillic horizon averages 25 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand.  The particle size control section averages 0 to 15 percent coarse fragments.\nThe Ap and A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2, 3 or 4 dry.  It has weak or moderate structure.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is heavy silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam, and has weak to moderate blocky or prismatic structure and thin to moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and in pores.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B3 or C horizons have hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  They are clay loam, and may be gravely or cobbly below a depth of 35 inches.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline."

Bissell, Cowiche, Galeppi, Margerum, Orr, Ralls, and Springmeyer soils are more than 40 inches deep.  Bjork soils are mildly alkaline in the B2t horizon, have schist or gneiss rock fragments in the particle size control section and are underlain by schist or gneiss at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Dodes soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Indiano soils have 15 to 35 percent rhyolitic or altered volcanic rock fragments in the particle size control section."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in weathered basalt, loess, and minor amounts of volcanic ash.  They are in a climate with 8 to 12 inches mean annual precipitation.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The frost free season is 120 to 170 days."
