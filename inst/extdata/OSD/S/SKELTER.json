Buffom, Carmack, Sulaof and Trojan soils have O horizons and lack strongly or extremely acid reactions in the lower part of the profile. Buffom and Suloaf soils also are deep to bedrock.  Elkcreek and Mojo are moderately deep to bedrock. Johnson soils have O horizons and are dry less than 90 days.  Molyneux soils lack stratified alluvium and lack strongly and extremely acid reactions in the lower part of the profile.  Muldoon soils have a duripan immediately below the argillic horizon. Simonton soils lack Bq horizons."

They formed in colluvium and residuum from old alluvium and volcanics.  Average annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches. The frost-free season is 70 to 90 days. Average annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 45 degrees F."
