  "OVERVIEW": "The Skelter series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from old alluvium and volcanics.  Permeability is moderately slow. They are on foothills and canyon escarpments and have slopes of 20 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature about 44 degrees F.",
