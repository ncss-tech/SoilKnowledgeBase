  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to free carbonates is greater than 80 inches. The rock fragment content by volume averages 5 to 45 percent in the loamy mantle, and 35 to 80 percent in the underlying till. The loamy mantle is 10 to 22 inches thick. Total silt plus clay is less than 30 percent in the till.\nSome pedons have an Oa or Oe horizon up to 3 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or silt loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 2 to 20 percent gravel, 2 to 20 percent cobbles, 2 to 20 percent stones, and 0 to 10 percent boulders. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon (when present) is up to 4 inches thick. It has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture, rock fragment content and reaction are similar to the A horizon.\nThe Bw1 horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Rock fragment content ranges from 2 to 30 percent gravel, 2 to 20 percent cobbles, 2 to 20 percent stones and 0 to 10 percent boulders. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw2 horizon (when present) is up to 8 inches thick. It has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture, rock fragment content and reaction are similar to the Bw1 horizon.\nThe 2Bw2 horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is coarse sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Rock fragment content averages 15 to 45 percent gravel, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, 5 to 15 percent stones, and 0 to 10 percent boulders. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 4. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, coarse sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Rock fragment content ranges from 10 to 50 percent gravel, 5 to 30 percent cobbles, 5 to 20 percent stones and 0 to 10 percent boulders. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid."

They formed in a loamy mantle and underlying coarse-textured skeletal glacial till. The mean annual air temperature is 367 to 39 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 27 to 2930 inches. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days. Elevation above sea level is 1400 to 1900 feet."
