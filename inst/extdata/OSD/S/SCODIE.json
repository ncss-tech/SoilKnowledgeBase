These soils formed in material weathered from granitic rocks.  Elevations are 3,800 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, much as snowfall.. The mean January temperature is about 35 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is about 70 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 58 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 75 to 180 days."
