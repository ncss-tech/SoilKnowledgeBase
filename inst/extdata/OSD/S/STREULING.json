  "OVERVIEW": "The Streuling series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils on hillsides and mountainsides.  The Streuling soils formed in residuum and colluvium from limestone.  Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 64 degrees F.  The soil moisture regime is xeric bordering on aridic.  The soils are dry for 70 to 90 consecutive days per year when the soil temperature is above 8 degrees C.\nThe soil is 10 to 20 inches deep over limestone bedrock.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon 7 to 10 inches thick and the depth to calcic horizon is 3 to 5 inches.  Rock fragments are mainly limestone and average 45 to 70 percent in the particle size control section which is dominanted by gravel and cobbles.  Clay content in the particle size control section averages 27 to 35 percent.  The calcium carbonate equivalent is 40 to 60 percent in the particle size control section, including coarse fragments less than 20 millimeters.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is a very gravelly loam or extremely gravelly loam.  It is neutral to slightly alkaline and is slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 10 to 40 percent.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is extremely gravelly loam, very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly clay loam or very gravelly clay loam.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 40 to 60 percent.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline and is strongly to violently effervescent.  Rock fragment content is 45 to 70 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobbles."
