  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum is 40 to more than 80 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 24 inches thick, and typically extends into the upper part of the Btg horizon.  Cracks of about one-half inch or more in width are in the A, Btg, and upper 2Btg horizons.  The linear extensibility is 6.0 cm or higher.\nThe A or Ap horizon have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  The A horizon is typically silty clay loam, but some pedons are silt loam. Also, some pedons have a thin E horizon. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe upper Btg has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe lower Btg horizon, below the mollic epipedon, and the 2Btg horizon have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2, with higher chroma iron masses and accumulations. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay or their gravelly and cobbly analogues.  Gravel and cobble content ranges from 1 to 60 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe 3Btg and BC horizons, where present, are mottled with hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is similar to the lower Btg horizon. Reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline."

Butler and Carbika soils have free carbonates at 18 to 80 inches. Chancellor soils have a mean annual temperature below 52 degrees F. and have free carbonates within 60 inches.  Clarinda, Coatsburg, Haig, Lodgepole, Mazaska, Minnetonka, Taintor, Terrabella, and Worthing soils have a mean annual temperature of less than 54 degrees F.  Edinburg soils do not have rock fragments in the series control section and are on till plains.  Fosterburg soils have a concentration of exchangeable sodium. Sampsel soils have a Cr (paralithic) horizon within 80 inches.  Virden soils have free carbonates in the lower part of the series control section, average less than 5 percent sand and have less than 1 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sacville soils are on very gently and gently sloping upland footslopes and on headslopes of drainageways. These soils formed in colluvium derived from a mixture of loess and material weathered from sedimentary rocks.  Slopes range from 1 to 9 percent.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges form 28 to 52 inches."

Both are on steeper hillslopes above the Sacville soils.  Freeburg soils are fine-silty and are on stream terraces. Hartville soils have an ochric epipedon and are on stream terraces below the Sacville soils."

They are mapped mainly in the Northview and Jefferson City geologic formations in Missouri.\nDiagnostic horizons and surface features recognized in this series are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 17 inches (Ap and Btg1 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from approximately 7 to 80 inches (Btg horizons).\nAquic feature - chroma of one and distinct redox concentrations in the lower part of the mollic epipedon.\nVertic feature - a linear extensibility of 6.0 cm or more.\nADDITIONAL DATA: University of Missouri Soil Characterization Laboratory Data Number -- M9016759\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
