  "OVERVIEW": "The Shule series consists of moderately deep to deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from rhyolitic tuff, or similar bedrock. These soils are on gently to steeply sloping mountain sides, hills, ridges and mesa tops. Slopes are 2 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.",

Ansel, Castelleia, Hierro, Jacquette, Lick, Peeler, Polvadera, Swifton, Trapper, Uinta, and Whitefish soils lack a lithic contact above depth of 100 cm.  Grimstone, Indart, Perceton, and Tongue River soils have a paralithic contact above depth 100 cm.  Edloe and Limber soils are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizons and have continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation.  Grimes soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in a major part of the Bt and C horizons, and have coarse fragments that are mainly less than 250 mm in diameter.  Sapphire soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in a major part of the solum and any C horizon.  Schofield soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower, have argillic horizons with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand much of which is medium and coarse angular granite sand, and have coarse fragments that are mainly less than 75 mm in diameter.  Swapps soils are calcareous in much of the solum, lack E horizons, and lack mixed E/Bt horizons.  Tahoma soils lack continuous E horizons, lack mixed E/Bt horizons, and occur in areas having peak periods of precipitation in the fall and winter.  Woodrock soils have argillic horizons with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand, much of which is medium and coarse angular granite sand, and are less than 60 percent base saturated in at least some part of the Bt horizon."
