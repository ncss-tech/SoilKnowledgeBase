  "OVERVIEW": "The Saddlerock series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium weathered from basalt, andesite and tuff. Saddlerock soils are on flood plains and have slopes of less than 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 47 degrees to 51 degrees F.  These soils are usually saturated between the depths of 20 and 40 inches from January through May because of a seasonal high water table.  One or more buried A horizons is present.  The 10 to 40 inch particle size control section is clay or silty clay with 40 to 60 percent clay. Few to many fine to medium distinct brown, dark brown, reddish yellow and light brown mottles occur from 10 to over 60 inches. Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Organic matter content ranges from 2 to 4 percent.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 12 to 18 inches.  Ponded phases have a peat surface layer 4 to 16 inches thick.\nThe A horizon dry color is 10YR 4/1 or 5/1.  Moist color is N 2/0, 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1 or 3/2.  The lower part has few to many distinct 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 5/3 or 7.5YR 3/4 or 4/2 mottles, moist. It is clay or silty clay.  Structure is angular blocky or prismatic parting to angular blocky.\nThe AC horizon dry color is 10YR 4/2, 5/1, 6/3, 7/1 or 5Y 4/2. Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 3/3, 4/2 or 5Y 4/1.  The color is usually variegated.  Structure is moderate medium to coarse angular blocky. Most pedons have C horizons that have strata of Ab horizons at a depth of 24 to 60 inches.\nThe C horizon when present, has a dry color of 10YR 6/1 or 5Y 7/1 and moist color of 10YR 3/1 or 5Y 4/1.  Structure is moderate or strong medium to coarse angular blocky or is massive."

The rest of the profile has an irregular decrease of organic matter with increasing depth.\n1.2  One or more buried horizons occur in the profile. 1.3  Clay content ranges from 40 to 60 percent (Hydrometer method).\n2.  Moisture Regime\n2.1  Aquic - Soil is usually saturated during winter and early spring due to a seasonal high water table at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  The lower part of the horizon and the rest of the profile has few to many distinct mottles. 2.2  Water tables fluctuate during the dry season and range from 40 to 60 inches in depth.\nSeries reclassified 6/96.  Competing series not updated at that time."
