  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 47 degrees to 51 degrees F.  These soils are usually saturated between the depths of 20 and 40 inches from January through May because of a seasonal high water table.  One or more buried A horizons is present.  The 10 to 40 inch particle size control section is clay or silty clay with 40 to 60 percent clay. Few to many fine to medium distinct brown, dark brown, reddish yellow and light brown mottles occur from 10 to over 60 inches. Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Organic matter content ranges from 2 to 4 percent.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 12 to 18 inches.  Ponded phases have a peat surface layer 4 to 16 inches thick.\nThe A horizon dry color is 10YR 4/1 or 5/1.  Moist color is N 2/0, 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1 or 3/2.  The lower part has few to many distinct 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 5/3 or 7.5YR 3/4 or 4/2 mottles, moist. It is clay or silty clay.  Structure is angular blocky or prismatic parting to angular blocky.\nThe AC horizon dry color is 10YR 4/2, 5/1, 6/3, 7/1 or 5Y 4/2. Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 3/3, 4/2 or 5Y 4/1.  The color is usually variegated.  Structure is moderate medium to coarse angular blocky. Most pedons have C horizons that have strata of Ab horizons at a depth of 24 to 60 inches.\nThe C horizon when present, has a dry color of 10YR 6/1 or 5Y 7/1 and moist color of 10YR 3/1 or 5Y 4/1.  Structure is moderate or strong medium to coarse angular blocky or is massive."

Ricco soil lack mottles, have a slightly acid or neutral reaction and have chromas less than 1 below the mollic epipedon.  Titus soils have stratified silt loam and sandy loam lower B horizons and stratified C horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Saddlerock soils are on flood plains. Elevation is 4400 to 5500 feet.  Slopes are less than 2 percent. These soils formed in alluvium weathered from basalt, andesite and tuff.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 9 to 16 inches. Snowfall ranges from 10 to 30 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 66 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 44 to 49 degrees F. Frost-free season is 60 to 130 days."

The rest of the profile has an irregular decrease of organic matter with increasing depth.\n1.2  One or more buried horizons occur in the profile. 1.3  Clay content ranges from 40 to 60 percent (Hydrometer method).\n2.  Moisture Regime\n2.1  Aquic - Soil is usually saturated during winter and early spring due to a seasonal high water table at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  The lower part of the horizon and the rest of the profile has few to many distinct mottles. 2.2  Water tables fluctuate during the dry season and range from 40 to 60 inches in depth.\nSeries reclassified 6/96.  Competing series not updated at that time.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This pedon was sampled in 1984; NSSL Pedon #S84CA-035-007.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
