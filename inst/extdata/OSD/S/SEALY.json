(Btg1 and Btg2 horizon)\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 6 inch layer\nGrossarenic feature - loamy fine sand from 0 to 48 inches (Ap, Eg1, and Eg2)\nArgillic horizon - 48 to 72 inches (Bt1 and Bt2)\nAquic feature-low chroma colors and endosaturation\nAdditional Comments: This series was revised in January 2001 as a part of the update of MLRA 150A.  Classification was changed from Ochraqualfs to Endoaqualfs. These soils were formerly mapped as a wet phase of the Kenney series.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from soils with similar parent material in Austin County, Texas.\nADDITIONAL DATA: None\nTAXONOMIC VERSION:  Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
