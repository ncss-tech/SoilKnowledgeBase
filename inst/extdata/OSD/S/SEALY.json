  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sealy series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in sandy sediments derived from the Willis Formation of late Pliocene age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on uplands along drainageways and stream channels.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent but typically 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 74 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches.",

Classification was changed from Ochraqualfs to Endoaqualfs. These soils were formerly mapped as a wet phase of the Kenney series.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from soils with similar parent material in Austin County, Texas.\nADDITIONAL DATA: None\nTAXONOMIC VERSION:  Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
