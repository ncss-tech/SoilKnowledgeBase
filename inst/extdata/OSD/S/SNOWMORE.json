  "OVERVIEW": "The Snowmore series consists of moderately deep to duripan, well drained soils that formed in loess over residuum derived from basalt and rhyolite.  Snowmore soils are on summits, shoulders and side slopes of plateaus, mountains, calderas, structural benches and hills. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
