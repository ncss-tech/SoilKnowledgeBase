Ditchcamp soils are slightly acid or neutral and lack lime in their duripans.  Drysel, Idow, and Rankane soils are not underlain by bedrock below the duripan.  Hager and Wako soils have bedrock at 100 to 150 cm. Wendell soils do not contain a Bg horizon that has a continuous brittle matrix."

They formed in loess over residuum derived from basalt or rhyolite.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Elevations are 1,070 to 1,865 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 90 to 130 days."
