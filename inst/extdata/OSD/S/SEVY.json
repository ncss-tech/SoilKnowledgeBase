Dixie soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Paulville soils have lithological discontinuities below the argillic horizon and allow 10YR hues. Stiles soils have an average clay content of 30 to 35 percent in the control section. Woozle series have hues of 10YR in the argillic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from basic and intermediate igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Elevations are 5,000 to 6,000 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The freeze free period is 100 to 140 days."
