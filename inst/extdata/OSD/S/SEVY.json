  "OVERVIEW": "The Sevy series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from basic and intermediate igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Sevy soils are on fan terraces, relict lake terraces, stream terraces, strath terraces and alluvial flats. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
