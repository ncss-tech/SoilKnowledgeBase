Further field investigations are needed to see if the series concept is valid in the eastern part of the MLRA in the future.   The glossic horizon is in question as to the extent in the MLRA.  If the glossic horizon is not typical, this series competes with the Oran series.  This series may become inactive in the future.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
