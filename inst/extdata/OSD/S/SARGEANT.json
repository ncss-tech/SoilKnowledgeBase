  "OVERVIEW": "The Sargeant series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in 30 to 66 centimeters (12 to 26 inches) of loess or loamy sediments and the underlying glacial till.  These soils are on interfluves and long side slopes on dissected till plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 790 millimeters (about 31 inches).  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (about 48 degrees F).",

Further field investigations are needed to see if the series concept is valid in the eastern part of the MLRA in the future.   The glossic horizon is in question as to the extent in the MLRA.  If the glossic horizon is not typical, this series competes with the Oran series.  This series may become inactive in the future."
