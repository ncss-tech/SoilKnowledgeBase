  "OVERVIEW": "The San Mateo series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium, fan alluvium and stream alluvium from mixed sources on alluvial fans on valley sides and flood plains on valley floors. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Average annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F. Average annual precipitation is about 11 inches.",
