  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Stonelake series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in sandy-skeletal glacial outwash on eskers, valley trains, kames, moraines, and terraces. These soils have moderately rapid or rapid permeability in the upper part and very rapid permeability in the lower part. Slope ranges from 1 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil moisture control section is dry for 20 to 35 consecutive days during the 120 days following the summer solstice. Carbonates are leached to a depth of 40 to 80 inches. Content of rock fragments, by volume, ranges from 5 to 45 percent in the A and E horizons, 35 to 70 percent in the B horizons and 10 to 70 percent in the C horizons. Cobbles and stones range from 0 to 30 percent throughout. A cobbly phase is recognized.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or their gravelly, very gravelly or cobbly analogues. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, coarse sand or their gravelly, very gravelly or cobbly analogues. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a BE or EB horizon with similar characteristics.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, chroma of 3 or 4. It is gravelly coarse sand, gravelly loamy coarse sand, gravelly sand, or their very gravelly or extremely gravelly or cobbly analogues. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, chroma of 3 or 4. It is very gravelly coarse sand, very gravelly loamy coarse sand, very gravelly sand, or their extremely gravelly or cobbly analogues. It is strongly acid to neutral. Clay bridging is common but has less than a 3 percent absolute clay increase.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is gravelly sand, gravelly coarse sand or their very gravelly or cobbly analogues. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 3 to 6. It is gravelly sand, gravelly coarse sand or their very gravelly, extremely gravelly or cobbly analogues. Stratification is common. It is strongly acid to slightly alkaline."
