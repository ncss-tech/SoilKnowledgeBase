  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil moisture control section is dry for 20 to 35 consecutive days during the 120 days following the summer solstice. Carbonates are leached to a depth of 40 to 80 inches. Content of rock fragments, by volume, ranges from 5 to 45 percent in the A and E horizons, 35 to 70 percent in the B horizons and 10 to 70 percent in the C horizons. Cobbles and stones range from 0 to 30 percent throughout. A cobbly phase is recognized.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or their gravelly, very gravelly or cobbly analogues. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, coarse sand or their gravelly, very gravelly or cobbly analogues. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a BE or EB horizon with similar characteristics.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, chroma of 3 or 4. It is gravelly coarse sand, gravelly loamy coarse sand, gravelly sand, or their very gravelly or extremely gravelly or cobbly analogues. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, chroma of 3 or 4. It is very gravelly coarse sand, very gravelly loamy coarse sand, very gravelly sand, or their extremely gravelly or cobbly analogues. It is strongly acid to neutral. Clay bridging is common but has less than a 3 percent absolute clay increase.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is gravelly sand, gravelly coarse sand or their very gravelly or cobbly analogues. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 3 to 6. It is gravelly sand, gravelly coarse sand or their very gravelly, extremely gravelly or cobbly analogues. Stratification is common. It is strongly acid to slightly alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Delameter, Emmert, Wakepish and Yellowdog series. Delameter and Wakepish soils have volcanic glass aggregate in the particle-size control section. The Emmert series does not have a argillic horizon with clay bridging. Yellowdog soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils have nearly level or convex slopes on eskers, valley trains, kames, moraines, and terraces. Slope ranges from 1 to 70 percent. These soils formed in sandy-skeletal glacial outwash of Late Wisconsin Age. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 47 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 33 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 90 to 150 days. Elevation ranges from 1,000 to 1,900 feet above sea level."

The excessively drained Mahtomedi soils are in similar landscape positions and do not have clay bridging in the subsoil. The very poorly drained Markey and Seelyeville soil are in depressions. Well drained Pierz and somewhat excessively drained Sanburn soils are in similar positions but have an argillic horizon. The excessively drained Two Inlets soils are in similar landscape positions and have less than 35 percent gravel in the series control section."
