These soils are in a mild marine climate with cool, dry summers and mild, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 460 to 635 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 11 degrees C. Frost-free season is 200 to 240 days."

Hoypus soils form under forest canopy on similar landscape positions.  San Juan soils are pachic and formed on dunes and hillslopes of glacial outwash plains."
