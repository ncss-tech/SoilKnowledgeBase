  "OVERVIEW": "The Snakelum series is a very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in eolian sands and compacted glacial outwash.  Snakelum soils formed under prairie vegetation and are found on hillslopes of glacial drift plains with slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 560 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 10.5 degrees C.",
