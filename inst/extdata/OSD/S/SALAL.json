It is silt loam to very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have thin lenses of silty clay loam or that contain 5 to 10 percent pebbles.  Redox features are at depths as shallow as 40 inches in some pedons and some pedons lack redox features within 60 inches."

The mean January temperature is 38 degrees F, the mean July temperature is 63 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 80 inches, most of which falls as rain during winter.  Snow is common in winter, but it does not remain on the ground for long at a time.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 150 to 190 days."
