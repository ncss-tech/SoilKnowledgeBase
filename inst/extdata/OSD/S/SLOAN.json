Gansner soils do not have a cambic horizon and have gleyed hues of 5G and 5GY in the lower part of the series control section. Ozamis soils have strata of ash within the series control section. Settlemeyer and Toppenish soils are calcareous in the upper part of the series control section."

The soils formed in loamy alluvium washed mainly from soils formed in loamy, calcareous drift. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 787 to 1041 mm (31 to 41 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 56 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 200 days. Elevation is 213 to 305 meters (700 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

The moderately well drained Eel, the well drained Genesee, and the somewhat poorly drained Shoals soils do not have mollic epipedons, and are nearer to stream channels or along more active streams. The moderately well drained Medway soils and well drained Ross soils are on higher landscape positions."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {

Depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between November and June in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. These soils are subject to flooding from late fall to spring. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high; in the sandy substratum phase, it is very high. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow. In the sandy substratum phase, permeability is rapid in the lower part of the series control section."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: A large part is artificially drained and cultivated. Corn and soybeans are the principal crops with small acreages of hay, oats, and vegetables. Other areas, especially on the flood plains of the smaller streams, are used for permanent pasture or woodland. Native vegetation is deciduous forest, chiefly elm, ash, sycamore, silver maple, and willow."
