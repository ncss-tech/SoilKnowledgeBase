The zone from 10 to 21 inches is not ashy as it is assumed to have less than 30 percent glass (loamy).  The zone from 21 to 31 inches is considered to be (ashy).  The zone from 31 to 40 inches is assumed to be (loamhy).  The zone from 10 to 40 inches is loamy over ashy over loamy and is called loamy over ashy, aniso.  The soil has an ochric epipedon based on crushed dry color of 10YR 6/3 at 6 to 12 inches and a cambic horizon at 6 to 21 inches."
