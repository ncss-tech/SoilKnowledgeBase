The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 53 degrees F.  These soils have a water table at 0 to 6 inches during the winter and early spring.  Soil reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral throughout.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 through 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and 2 through 4 moist and dry and is mottled.  Texture is ashy silt loam or ashy loam.  It is assumed to have a moist bulk density of 0.90 to 1.00 g/cm3.  The acid oxalate aluminium plus one-half the acid oxalate iron is 1.0 to 1.5.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 5 to 8 moist, 6 to 8 dry and chroma of 1 through 8 moist and dry.  It is ashy sand or ashy coarse sand.\nThe 3C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry,and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or loam.\nThe 4C horizon is sapric or hemic material and ranges widely in color."

The soils formed in alluvium from basic igneous rocks with a mantle of volcanic ash.  The climate is mild marine with 50 to 70 inches annual precipitation occurring mostly as rain during the winter.  The mean January temperature is 35 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 64 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The frost free season is 125 to 175 days."

The zone from 10 to 21 inches is not ashy as it is assumed to have less than 30 percent glass (loamy).  The zone from 21 to 31 inches is considered to be (ashy).  The zone from 31 to 40 inches is assumed to be (loamhy).  The zone from 10 to 40 inches is loamy over ashy over loamy and is called loamy over ashy, aniso.  The soil has an ochric epipedon based on crushed dry color of 10YR 6/3 at 6 to 12 inches and a cambic horizon at 6 to 21 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
