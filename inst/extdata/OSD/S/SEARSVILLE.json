  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to the lithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Coarse fragments, of gravel and cobble size, range from a few to 25 percent on the\nsurface and in the soil.  Coarse fragments are mostly limestone\nwith a small amount of chert and ironstone.  The dry soil has\ncracks 1 to 4 cm wide to depths of 25 to 45 cm. The control\nsection ranges from 20 to about 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nThe A horizon is dark brown (7.5YR 4/2, 3/2), dark reddish brown\n(5YR 3/4, 3/3), reddish brown (5YR 4/4, 4/3), and dark reddish\nbrown (5YR 3/3).  A horizons with moist values and chromas of less than 3.5 are less than 7 inches thick.  The texture ranges from\nclay to silty clay.\nThe fine-earth textures in the B2 horizons are clay or silty clay, with a clay content of 40 to 60 percent.  The B21 horizon is dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4), red (2.5YR 4/6), and dark red (2.5YR\n3/6). The B22ca horizon is dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4), reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4; 5YR 5/4, 4/4), yellowish red (5YR 5/6, 4/6), and red (2.5YR 5/6, 4/6). The B22ca horizon contains 5 to 25 percent limestone fragments 2 mm to 2 inches in diameter.\nThe R layer is platy to massive limestone that is fractured in the upper part."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soil formed in calcareous clayey sediments over hard limestone of Lower\nCretaceous Age.  Climate is moist subhumid.  The mean annual temperature is 64 degrees to 68 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 35 inches and the Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 46 to 56."
