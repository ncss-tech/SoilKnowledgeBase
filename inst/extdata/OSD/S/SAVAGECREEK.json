  "OVERVIEW": "The Savagecreek series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed from volcanic ash and colluvium over marine deposits. Savagecreek soils are on upper, dissected marine terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1650 millimeters (65 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
