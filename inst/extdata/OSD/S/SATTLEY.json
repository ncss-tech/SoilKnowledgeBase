    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact of andesitic conglomerate or tuff breccia is 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 43 degrees to 47 degrees.  The soil temperature is above 41 degrees from about April 1 to November 15 and above 47 degrees from about April 15 to November 1.  Mean summer soil temperatures are more than 59 degrees.  The soil between depths of about 10 to 24 inches is usually dry all of the time from July 15 until November 1 and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.  Rock fragments including stones, cobbles, and pebbles vary from 25 to 50 percent by volume in the upper horizons.  The amount of fragments increase with depth and ranges from 50 to 85 percent in the lower half of the profile.   Base saturation is between 50 and 75 percent in all horizons.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown and dark grayish brown, gray, dark gray, and brown in hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 6/2, 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 5/2.  It has 20 to 30 percent clay and is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  This horizon has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure.  Reaction is slightly acid or strongly acid."

Apmat soils average less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Durst, Fravel, Kalo, Klicker, Monasterio, Mulshoe, and Sapkin soils have bedrock between a depth 20 to 40 inches.  Henhoit soils have dominant hues and 2.5YR and chromas greater than 3 in the Bt horizons.  Klickson soils are usually moist, but dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 days in July and August.  Little Wood soils have a sandy skeletal layer immediately below the argillic horizon and above a 40 inch depth.  Morningstar soils have greater than 60 percent rock fragments throughout the profile."

They formed in very stony coarse textured materials weathered from andesitic, rhyolitic, and basaltic rocks.  The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 22 inches.  Average January temperature is 27 degrees average July temperature is 60 degrees and mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees.
