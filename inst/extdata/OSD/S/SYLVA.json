  "STATES": "NC",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sylva series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils on nearly level colluvial fans and flats in the Southern Appalachian Mountains.  These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from materials weathered from felsic to mafic crystalline rocks such as granite, hornblende gneiss, and mica gneiss.  Near the type location, mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 22 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Rock fragment content, dominantly gravel, is 0 to 15 percent.  Content of mica flakes ranges from few to many.  Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid unless limed.  In the 10 to 40 inch control section, coarse-loamy materials that overlie sandy horizons have more than 50 percent fine and coarser sand.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of l to 3, or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3.   It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nAn Ab horizon occurs in some pedons below a depth of 40 inches.  It is similar in color and texture to the A horizon.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or it is neutral with value of 4 to 6.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Thin layers, lenses, or pockets of silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, or loamy sand are in the Bg horizon in some pedons.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or it is neutral with value of 4 to 7.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  Thin layers of silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam are in the Cg horizon i some pedons.  Also, some pedons have a 2Cg horizon below 60 inches that is saprolite weathered from felsic to mafic crystalline rocks such as granite, hornblende gneiss, or mica gneiss."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sylva soils are on nearly level colluvial fans and flats at the heads of drains in the Southern Appalachian Mountains.  Elevations range from 2,000 to 4,000 feet. These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from materials weathered from felsic to mafic crystalline rocks such as granite, hornblende gneiss, and mica gneiss.  Slope is commonly 0 to 2 percent, but ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Seeps and springs are common.  Near the type location, mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

Cashiers, Chandler, Chestnut, Cleveland, Edneyville, Plott and Porters are well drained soils that formed in residuum and are on higher ridges and side slopes.  Chatuge, Dillard, and Statler soils are on terraces and have argillic horizons.  Cullowhee, Dellwood, Nikwasi, Reddies, and Toxaway soils are on flood plains.  Cullasaja, Haywood, Tuckasegee, Tusquitee, and Whiteside soils are in colluvial positions higher than Sylva soils and are well or moderately well drained.  Whiteside soils are usually associated in the landscape with Sylva soils in slightly higher or convex areas."

However, Sylva soils lack the umbric epipedon, fine-loamy textures, and frequent flooding of the Toxaway soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\nHumic Haplaquept feature - The presence of moist color value less than 3.5 in the 0 to 8 inch A horizon, and the 8 inch thickness is less than one-third the depth to the base of the Bg horizon or a minimum of 10 inches.\nOchric Epipedon - 0 to 8 inches (A Horizon)\nCambic Horizon - 8 to 37 inches (Bg1 and Bg2 Horizons)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
