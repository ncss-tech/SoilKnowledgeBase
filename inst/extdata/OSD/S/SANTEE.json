  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon; moderately acid to mildly alkaline in the Btg horizon and slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the Cg horizon.  The base saturation is more than 50 percent in the A horizon and may range up to about 90 percent or more at 36 to 72 inches below the surface.  The particle-size control section has less than 30 percent silt.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, or it is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 1.  It is loam, clay loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe upper part of the Btg horizon commonly has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y or it is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1.  The lower part of the Btg horizon and the upper part of the Btg horizon in some pedons has hue of 10YR to 5Y or it is neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow, or olive are in most pedons.  The Btg horizon is clay, sandy clay, or clay loam.\nThe BCg horizon, where present, is 5 to 12 inches thick and has hue of 10YR, 5Y, 5BG, or neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is clay, sandy clay, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Cg horizon has colors like the BCg horizon.  Texture is variable ranging from clayey to sandy material."

Carwile and Muldrow soils are dry for longer periods of time.  Bayboro, Brookman, Byars, Cape Fear, and Samba soils have an umbric epipedon.  Jeanerette and Morey soils have less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand in the particle-size control section.  Stono soils have less than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section."

These soils are on the low marine terraces from 5 to 25 feet above sea level.  They formed in clayey marine sediments, which in places is underlain with marl at depths ranging from 6 to l5 feet below the surface.  The mean annual rainfall is 50 inches, and the frost-free growing season is 270 days."
