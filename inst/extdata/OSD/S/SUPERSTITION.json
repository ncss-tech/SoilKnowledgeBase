  "OVERVIEW": "The Superstition series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy eolian deposits.  Superstition soils are on dunes and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 3 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 74 degrees F.",
