  "STATES": "ND",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Shibah series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium over limestone gravel alluvium.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and rapid in the underlying material.  These soils are on fans, terraces, sideslopes, and ridges of dissected terraces and fans on slopes ranging from 3 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
