  "OVERVIEW": "The Shuberts series consists of moderately deep, poorly drained, soils formed in sandy beach deposits underlain by limestone bedrock.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",

It is mucky fine sand, fine sand, or sand.\nThe C horizon has a value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 1 to 4. It is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, loamy sand or gravelly analogues of these textures. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."

Elevations are 180 to 185 meters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 710 to 810 millimeters. The mean annual air temperature ranges from about 3 to 5 degrees C.  The frost free period is 90 to 155 days."

Deer Park soils are excessively drained and are on dunes and beach ridges. Chippeny soils are very poorly drained, have 41 to 130 centimeters of organic material over bedrock, and are in depressions."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are: Ochric epipedon - 0 to 15 centimeters\nAquic conditions - endosaturation in the C horizon is based on a presumed positive reaction with alpha,alpha-dipyridyl at some time during the year in most years. The inherent color of the parent material causes a red matrix in a reducing environment.\nLithic contact - 71 centimeters."
