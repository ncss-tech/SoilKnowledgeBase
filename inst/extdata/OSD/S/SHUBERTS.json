Elevations are 180 to 185 meters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 710 to 810 millimeters. The mean annual air temperature ranges from about 3 to 5 degrees C.  The frost free period is 90 to 155 days."

Deer Park soils are excessively drained and are on dunes and beach ridges. Chippeny soils are very poorly drained, have 41 to 130 centimeters of organic material over bedrock, and are in depressions."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are: Ochric epipedon - 0 to 15 centimeters\nAquic conditions - endosaturation in the C horizon is based on a presumed positive reaction with alpha,alpha-dipyridyl at some time during the year in most years. The inherent color of the parent material causes a red matrix in a reducing environment.\nLithic contact - 71 centimeters.\nADDITIONAL DATA: The pedon descriptions supporting this series concept are stored in NASIS.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
