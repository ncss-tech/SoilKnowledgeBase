  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon is greater than 16 inches.  The depth to silty or loamy sediments typically is about 30 inches and ranges between 20 and 40 inches. The depth to carbonates typically is about 30 inches and ranges between 16 and 40 inches. A thin stone line is at the upper boundary of the 2Bk or 2C horizon in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and 2 to 4 dry, and chroma of 1.  Chroma of 2 is allowed if it is below 7 inches or if the horizon is dry.  It typically is fine sandy loam or sandy loam, but is loam or loamy fine sand in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4 and 3 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Few to common, faint to distinct redoximorphic features are in lower parts of some pedons.  The Bw horizon is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Some pedons have thin horizons of loamy sand or loamy fine sand in the B or C horizon, but the average texture of the material between depths of 10 inches and the upper boundary of the 2C horizon is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  The Bw horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline. Some pedons have 2Bw, Bk or C horizons.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam, or loam or clay loam till.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam, or loam or clay loam till.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 24 inches.  Growing season is 120 to 130 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 15 to 18 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 3000."

Beotia soils are fine-silty and are on slightly higher positions.   Clontarf, Malachy and Towner soils are on similar landscapes.  Malachy soils are calcareous within depths of 10 inches and do not have a discontinuity of finer textured materials within 40 inches.  Towner soils have sandy particle-size in the upper control section and have contrasting textures.  Embden, Ulen and Wyndmere soils are on slightly lower concave positions.  The Ulen and Wyndmere soils have a calcic horizon within depths of 16 inches and have a wetter soil moisture control section.  Hecla and Hamar soils are on broad flats and swales.  Hamar and Hecla soils have a sandy particle-size control section and have wetter soil moisture control sections."
