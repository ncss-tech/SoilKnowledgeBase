  "OVERVIEW": "The Schattel series consists of deep to shale that has clay texture, well drained soils that formed in clayey residuum of Quarternary age. These gently sloping to moderately sloping soils are on hillslopes. Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent.

The native vegetation in excellent condition is composed of about 90 percent grasses, 5 percent woody plants and 5 percent forbs.  In excellent condition, mid grasses such as pink pappusgrass and plains bristlegrass dominate.  Blackbrush is the dominant woody plant.  Fourflower trichloris and fourwing saltbush are indicative of small areas of higher salinity on this range site.  As retrogression occurs, woody plants such as blackbush, condalias, twisted acacia, cenizo, pricklypear, guayacan, dessert yaupon and goldenweed increase or invade.  Grasses which increase or invade are the Halls panicum, threeawn, curly mesquite and red grama."
