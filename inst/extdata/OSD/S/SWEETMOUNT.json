Badwater soils are very deep and are dominated by boulders in the particle-size control section.  Bickmore, Bluebell, Buena Vista, Hawkinspeak, Littlemud, Rutherford, and Woodhurst soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Booneville soils are very deep and have mean annual soil temperature of 36 to 40 degrees F.  Dailybasin soils have an ustic moisture regime. Parkalley soils are very deep, have the base of the argillic horizon between 28 and 35 inches from the soil surface, and are dominated by flagstones.  Parkay soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Redbird soils are very deep, average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates within 40 inches of the soil surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sweetmount soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on shoulder positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite, tuff, or tuff-breccia.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 8,000 to 10,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches, the mean annual temperature is 36 to 42 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
