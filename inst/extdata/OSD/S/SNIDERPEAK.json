The mean annual winter soil temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.  The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 6 to 9 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, and are dry 0 to 30 consecutive days in the soil moisture control section; udic moisture regime.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact has andic soil properties and 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 15 to 30 percent for air dried samples.  It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.  It has 8 to 18 percent field estimated clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 3, 4, or 6 dry.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid.  It has 5 to 15 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5Y moist and dry, value of 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3, 4, or 6 moist and 4 or 6 dry.  It is extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, extremely gravelly medial loam, or extremely cobbly medial sandy loam.  The horizon is weakly or moderately smeary.  Reaction is moderately acid.

Blackjack, Fahnestock, and Kahkwa soils are deep.  Mueller, and Musgrove soils are very deep.  Sorethumb soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks.  Sorethumb soils have a difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature of 3 to 5 degrees F.  Stonybrook soils are strongly acid throughout the subsoil.  Tylerpeak soils have hard bedrock at 20 to 40 inches."
