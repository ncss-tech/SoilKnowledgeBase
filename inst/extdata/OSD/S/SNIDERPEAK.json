  "OVERVIEW": "The Sniderpeak series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from marine basalt and associated volcanic rocks predominantly on continental glaciated mountain slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 80 inches and average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.  It has 8 to 18 percent field estimated clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 3, 4, or 6 dry.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid.  It has 5 to 15 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5Y moist and dry, value of 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3, 4, or 6 moist and 4 or 6 dry.  It is extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, extremely gravelly medial loam, or extremely cobbly medial sandy loam.  The horizon is weakly or moderately smeary.  Reaction is moderately acid.
