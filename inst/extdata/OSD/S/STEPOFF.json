  "OVERVIEW": "The Stepoff series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over colluvium and residuum from granitic and metamorphic rock.  The Stepoff soils are on mountain slopes and have slopes of 15 to 65 percent.  Permeability is moderate. The average annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
