    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 66 degrees to 67 degrees F. and the soil temperature is always above 47 degrees F. The soil is typically loamy fine sand but may be loamy sand or sand. The soil between depths of 12 and 35 inches is dry in all parts from March through December 1 and is not moist in some or all parts for as long as 75 consecutive days. The soil is more than 60 inches deep. Organic matter is less than 0.5 percent. The soil is effervescent throughout, with calcium carbonate ranging from 1 to 5 percent. The soil is effervescent throughout, with calcium carbonate ranging from 1 to 5 percent. There are a few shell fragments throughout the soil profile. The A horizon has dry color of 2.5Y 5/2, 7/2 or 7/1 and moist color of 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2 or 5/2. It is slightly acid to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 5Y 7/1 or 2.5YR 7/1 and moist color of 5Y 5/2 or 2.5Y 5/2. SAR ranges from 13 to 60. This horizon is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sandridge soils occur on basin rims. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The slopes formed in wind-blown deposits derived dominantly from lake beach sediments composed of acid igneous and sedimentary rock. Elevations are 195 to 220 feet. The climate is arid and has hot, dry summers and mild, somewhat moist winters. The average annual precipitation is 6 inches. Mean January temperature is 47 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 85 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 65 degrees F. Frost-free season is 255 to 270 days."

Rambla soils have a sandy over clayey particle-size control section and an aquic soil moisture. Westcamp soils have an aquic soil moisture regime and a fine-silty particle-size control section."
