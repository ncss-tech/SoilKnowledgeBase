  "OVERVIEW": "The Sandridge series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in wind-blown deposits derived dominantly from lake beach sediments composed of acid igneous and sedimentary rock.  Sandridge soils are on basin rims and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 6 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 65 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 66 degrees to 67 degrees F. and the soil temperature is always above 47 degrees F. The soil is typically loamy fine sand but may be loamy sand or sand. The soil between depths of 12 and 35 inches is dry in all parts from March through December 1 and is not moist in some or all parts for as long as 75 consecutive days. The soil is more than 60 inches deep. Organic matter is less than 0.5 percent. The soil is effervescent throughout, with calcium carbonate ranging from 1 to 5 percent. The soil is effervescent throughout, with calcium carbonate ranging from 1 to 5 percent. There are a few shell fragments throughout the soil profile. The A horizon has dry color of 2.5Y 5/2, 7/2 or 7/1 and moist color of 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2 or 5/2. It is slightly acid to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 5Y 7/1 or 2.5YR 7/1 and moist color of 5Y 5/2 or 2.5Y 5/2. SAR ranges from 13 to 60. This horizon is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline."
