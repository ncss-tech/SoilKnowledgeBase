  "OVERVIEW": "The St. Paul series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in silty alluvium of Pleistocene age over residuum of weathered siltstone/sandstone of Permian age. These soils are on broad nearly level to moderately sloping paleoterraces of an alluvial plain remnant of the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C). Slope is mainly less than 3 percent but ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is 660 mm (26 in).",
