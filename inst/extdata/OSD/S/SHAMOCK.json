  "OVERVIEW": "The Shamock series consists of moderately deep over a duripan, well drained soils that are on fan remnants, alluvial plains and relict alluvial flats. Shamock soils formed in mixed alluvium. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 66 degrees F.",
