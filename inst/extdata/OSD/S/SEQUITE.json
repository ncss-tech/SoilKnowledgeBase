  "OVERVIEW": "The Sequite series consists of shallow to a hardpan, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments. Sequite soils are on lake plain terraces and have slopes of 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
