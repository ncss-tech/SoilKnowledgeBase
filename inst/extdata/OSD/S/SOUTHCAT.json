  "OVERVIEW": "The Southcat series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Southcat soils are on beach plains. Slopes are 0 to 10 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
