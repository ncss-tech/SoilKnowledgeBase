  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Seldovia  soils are formed in an ash mantle that averages 25 inches thick over variable materials including glacial till and colluvial deposits.  Volcanic ash has been incorporated into the underlying till and colluvium to depths of 40 inches or more by leaching and mass movement.   Seldovia soils are on glacial moraines and mountainslopes.  Slopes range from 8 to 120 percent.  Elevations are 20 to 1500 feet.\nThe climate is maritime with mild winters and cool summers.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 65 to 75 inches and the mean annual snowfall is 70 to 140 inches.  Mean January temperature is 23 degrees F., mean July temperature is 52 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature ranges from 35  to 39 degrees F."

Jakolof soils have a control section formed in sand and gravel of stream terraces.  Koyuktolik soils are formed in organic matter accumulated in depressions.  Portgraham and Kasitsna soils occur on similar landscapes or in complex with Seldovia soils.  Tutka soils have bedrock within 20 inches and occur on glacially abraded bedrock ridges."
