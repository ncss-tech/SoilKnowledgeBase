  "OVERVIEW": "The Seldovia series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in a silty mantle of volcanic ash over variable material including glacial till, reworked glacial till, and colluvial deposits.  Seldovia soils are on glacial moraines and mountainslopes.  Slopes range from 8 to 65 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.  and the mean annual precipitation is about 70 inches.",
