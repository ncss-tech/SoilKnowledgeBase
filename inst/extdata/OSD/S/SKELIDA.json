  "OVERVIEW": "The Skelida series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess and alluvium derived dominantly from basalt and andesite.  These soils are on terraces at elevations of 400 to 1,000 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  Mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 16 inches thick.  The solum thickness is 60 inches or more.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 25 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry.  Base saturation (by ammonium acetate) ranges from 20 to 40 percent and is 27 percent in the type location.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR.  Base saturation (by ammonium acetate) is estimated to be 25 to 50 percent."
