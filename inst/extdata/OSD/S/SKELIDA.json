  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  Mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 16 inches thick.  The solum thickness is 60 inches or more.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 25 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry.  Base saturation (by ammonium acetate) ranges from 20 to 40 percent and is 27 percent in the type location.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR.  Base saturation (by ammonium acetate) is estimated to be 25 to 50 percent."

Slopes are 5 to 30 percent.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 70 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 67 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 160 to 180 days."
