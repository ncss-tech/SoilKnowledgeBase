  "OVERVIEW": "The Sicklesteets series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or slide deposits derived from calcareous rock sources.  These soils are on mountain slopes and landslides.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
