    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 35 degrees F.  Thickness of the loess mantle ranges from 1 to 5 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon and the depth to the clayey substratum ranges from 17 to 37 inches.\nThe A horizon has moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 2 or 3; and moist chroma of 1, 2, or 3.  Texture is silt loam, silt, or mucky silt loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has moist hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; moist value of 2, 3, or 4; and moist chroma of 1, 2, or 3.  Texture is fine sand, sand, coarse sand, or loamy fine sand.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 3C horizon has moist hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; moist value of 4 or 5; and moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 30 percent subangular cobble and gravel, with 0 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobble.  Effervescence is none or slight.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Slopes range from 0 to 7 percent.\nThe climate is subarctic continental with long, cold winters and short, warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 17 inches and the mean annual snowfall is 39 to 68 inches.  Mean January temperature is minus 10 degrees F., mean July temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature varies from 23 degrees to 27 degrees F."

The organic mat of the Klanelneechena soils is undisturbed, resulting in better insulation, lower soil temperature, and permafrost within the control section."
