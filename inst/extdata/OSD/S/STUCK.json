  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Stuck series consists of somewhat poorly drained soils formed in a thin mantle of silty loess overlying sandy alluvium and underlain by clayey lacustrine deposits.  Stuck soils are in drainages and depressions on broad high lacustrine terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 7 percent.  Men annual temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 12 inches.",

Thickness of the mollic epipedon and the depth to the clayey substratum ranges from 17 to 37 inches.\nThe A horizon has moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 2 or 3; and moist chroma of 1, 2, or 3.  Texture is silt loam, silt, or mucky silt loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has moist hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; moist value of 2, 3, or 4; and moist chroma of 1, 2, or 3.  Texture is fine sand, sand, coarse sand, or loamy fine sand.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 3C horizon has moist hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; moist value of 4 or 5; and moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 30 percent subangular cobble and gravel, with 0 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobble.  Effervescence is none or slight.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
