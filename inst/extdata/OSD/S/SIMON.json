These soils formed in loess high in volcanic ash over alluvium derived mainly from shale, chert, and volcanic rocks.  Some areas of this soil formed in colluvium derived from andesite.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,610 to 2,500 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."
