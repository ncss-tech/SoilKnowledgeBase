Ecklund and Tipper soils have bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 cm.  Razito soils are not influenced by volcanic glass.  Kawich and Isolde soils are dominated by fine sand in the particle-size control section.  Sheppard soils have hue of 5YR and are not influenced by volcanic glass.  Stumble soils have noncalcareous A horizons. Hawsley soils have a Ck horizon.  Tipperary soils are dominated by sand in the particle-size control section and are not influenced by volcanic glass.  Tricera soils are free of carbonates to depths of 100 cm or more and are not influenced by volcanic glass.  Yenrab soils have greater than 15 percent exchangeable sodium."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sundown soils are on sand sheets superimposed over fan remnants and fan skirts.  These soils formed in eolian deposits with a strong pyroclastic influence of volcanic glass over alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,250 to 1,740 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 175 mm, the mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 130 to 160 days."

Monte Cristo and Oricto soils have argillic horizons."
