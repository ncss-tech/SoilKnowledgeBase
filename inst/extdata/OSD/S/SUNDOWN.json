  "OVERVIEW": "The Sundown series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian deposits with a strong pyroclastic influence of volcanic glass over alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Sundown soils are on sand sheets superimposed over fan remnants and fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",

Ecklund and Tipper soils have bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 cm.  Razito soils are not influenced by volcanic glass.  Kawich and Isolde soils are dominated by fine sand in the particle-size control section.  Sheppard soils have hue of 5YR and are not influenced by volcanic glass.  Stumble soils have noncalcareous A horizons. Hawsley soils have a Ck horizon.  Tipperary soils are dominated by sand in the particle-size control section and are not influenced by volcanic glass.  Tricera soils are free of carbonates to depths of 100 cm or more and are not influenced by volcanic glass.  Yenrab soils have greater than 15 percent exchangeable sodium."
