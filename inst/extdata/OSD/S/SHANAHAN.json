    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature without an O horizon is 52 to 59 degrees F. and with an O horizon is 40 to 47 degrees F., and the mean winter soil temperature is 32 to 35 degrees F. The soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Depth to the buried loamy soil (2Bwb) is 14 to 40 inches. The ash and pumice are dacitic. Pumice size gravel fragments are 2 to 15 millimeters in diameter and predominantly are less than 8 millimeters in diameter. The ash mantle and upper part of the particle-size control section averages 5 to 35 percent paragravelly pumice fragments, 70 to 100 percent glass and glass-coated aggregates, phosphate retention of 25 to 50 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron of 0.4 to 0.9 percent, 15 bar water content of 4 to 7 percent on both dried and undried samples and moist bulk density of 0.70 to 1.00 grams per cubic centimeter. The ash mantle has field estimated clay content of 0 to 5 percent and the buried loamy material has field estimated clay content of 10 to 20 percent.\nSome pedons have an O horizon up to 3 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist, 1 through 3 dry. It is paragravelly ashy loamy coarse sand or ashy loamy coarse sand. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon when present, has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 6 moist, 1 to 4 dry. It is ashy loamy coarse sand, ashy coarse sand or paragravelly ashy loamy coarse sand. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 to 8 moist, 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 6 moist and 1 to 4 dry. Basaltic sand grains have value of 2 moist or dry. It is ashy coarse sand or ashy loamy coarse sand with 0 to 55 percent paragravelly pumice fragments. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2B horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and 1 to 4 dry. It is loam, sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, or fine sandy loam and has field-estimated clay of about 10 to 20 percent.\nSome pedons below a depth of 40 inches have a 3C horizon comprised of stratified black sands and gravel."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Almac, Codylake, Gahee, Helter, Nile and Spexarth series. Almac soils have E and Bs horizons and are 40 to 60 inches deep to schist or gneiss. Codylake soils have a granodiorite paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches and have a loam, sandy loam, or silt loam ash mantle. Helter soils have a silt loam ash mantle. Gahee soils have albic and cambic diagnostic horizons in the upper part of the profile. Nile soils lack pararock fragments. Spexarth soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Shanahan soils are on pumice mantled ridges, cinder cones, benches, lava plains, lava plateaus and terraces. Slopes are 0 to 45 percent. Elevations range from 4,000 to 6,000 feet. The soils formed in moderately thick, air-laid mantles of dacitic pumiceous ash over buried loamy soils. The climate is subhumid with cool dry summers and cold winters with much snow. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 41 inches. The mean January temperature is 25 to 27 degrees F., the mean July temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 37 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 0 to 50 days."
