  "OVERVIEW": "The Saraph series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from tuff.  Saraph soils are on rock pediments and plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

These soils formed mainly in residuum derived from soft vitric tuff, with minor amounts of loess and colluvium derived from basalt.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,400 to 2,030 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
