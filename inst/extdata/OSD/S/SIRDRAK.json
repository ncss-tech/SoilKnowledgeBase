    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 56 degrees F and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F at any time.  The difference between mean winter and mean summer temperature is less than 9 degrees F.  Soil between the depths of 12 and 36 inches is usually moist from mid-November to mid-June.  It is dry in some part the rest of the time.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 5 percent to depths of more than 20 inches and decreases regularly with increasing depth.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.  The soil is sand or loamy sand throughout and has 80 to 95 percent sand.  Base saturation ranges from 50 to 85 percent in the upper 20 to 24 inches and from 35 to 50 percent at depths of 45 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 3/2 or 3/3 and moist color of 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3, 3/1 or 2/1.  It has weak granular structure or is single grained or massive.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 6/6, 5/4, 5/6, 4/3, 4/4; 5Y 7/2, 7/3; or 2.5Y 4/2 7/2, 7/4; ad moist color of 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 4/4, 4/6, 3/2, 3/4; 2.5Y 4/2, 5/4; 5Y 5/3, 6/3."
