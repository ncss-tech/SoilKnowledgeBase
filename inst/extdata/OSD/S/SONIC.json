  "OVERVIEW": "The Sonic series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in stratified alluvium derived from limestone.  These nearly level to strongly sloping soils are on inset fans on fan piedmonts. Slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
