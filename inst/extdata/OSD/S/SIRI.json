  "OVERVIEW": "The Siri series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from quartzite, sandstone and limestone, with a component of loess.  The Siri soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
