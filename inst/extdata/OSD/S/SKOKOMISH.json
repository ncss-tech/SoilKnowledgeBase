It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry and has few to many, faint to distinct redox concentrations.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 0 to 2 moist and dry and has many prominent redox concentrations.  It is mostly stratified silt loam and very fine sandy loam above 48 inches and is stratified with layers of gravelly sand to clay below."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Skokomish soils formed in recent alluvium on flood plains at an elevation of sea level to about 200 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  These soils are in a mild, marine climate.  Summers are cool and relatively dry.  Winters are mild and wet.  Average annual precipitation is 60 to 90 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 38 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 180 to 220 days."

The organic carbon is estimated to be more than 0.2 percent at 50 inches.  The Ap horizon meets the color requirement for a mollic subgroup.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
