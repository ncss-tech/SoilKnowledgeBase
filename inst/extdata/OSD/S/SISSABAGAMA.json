  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the sandy mantle and depth to the stratified material ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy mantle and from 0 to 5 percent in the stratified material.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum, but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the substratum.  Carbonates are absent to more than 80 inches.  Redox accumulations are within 40 inches.  Saturation occurs at 30 to 40 inches for 30 days in most years. Base saturation is less than 50 percent.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some forested pedons have an O horizon of partially decomposed litter.  It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture is loamy sand.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loamy sand or sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is sand or loamy sand.  Bw horizons with spodic colors have pH greater than 5.9 or organic carbon content of less than 0.6 percent or do not have an overlying albic horizon.\nThe E part of the E&Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  The Bt part has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Typically, texture is sand or loamy sand.  The thickness of each lamella ranges from 1/16 to 3 inches.\nSome pedons have Bt horizons with colors and textures similar to the Bt part of the E&Bt.  The combined thickness of the lamellae (greater than 3/8 inch thick) and Bt horizons, if present, is less than 6 inches.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is stratified with layers of fine sand, very fine sand, loamy very fine sand, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt, or silt loam.  Some pedons have strata of sand or loamy sand."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sissabagama soils are on outwash plains, outwash terraces, lake terraces, and lake plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  These soils formed in sandy deposits underlain by stratified loamy and sandy lacustrine deposits.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 30  inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 42 degrees F. The average frost free period ranges from about 110 to 130 days.  Elevation ranges from 900 to 1200 feet."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Surface runoff is slow.  Permeability is rapid in the solum and moderate in the substratum.  Sissabagama soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 2.5 to 3.5 for 1 month or more per year at some time during September to June. The water table is perched over stratified lacustrine sediments, but in most years will eventually saturate the lacustrine sediments and exhibit an apparent water table."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Many areas are used for cropland.  Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay. Some areas are used for pastureland.  Some areas which were used for cropland have been allowed to revert to woodland.  Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest commonly with some grass in the understory.  The most common trees are northern red oak and bur oak with some red pine, eastern white pine, quaking aspen, and bigtooth aspen."
