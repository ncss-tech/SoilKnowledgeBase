  "OVERVIEW": "The Spickert series consists of deep or very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess and the underlying residuum from siltstone on hills. They are moderately deep to a fragipan. Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

Base saturation determined by field kits also shows the base status goes above and below 35 percent, but is dominantly below 35 percent at the critical depth.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon: the zone from 5 to 18 cm (2 to 7 inches) (Ap horizon)\n2) Argillic horizon: the zone from 18 to 147 cm (7 to 58 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3,\n2Btx1, 2Btx2 horizons)\n3) Fragipan: the zone from 79 to 124 cm (31 to 49 inches) (2Btx1 horizon)\n4) Lithic contact: the zone from 163 to 188 cm (64 to 74 inches)\n5) Redoximorphic depletions: the zone from 71 to 163 cm (28 to 64 inches).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data available: Agricultural Experiment Station, Purdue University; Station Bulletin No. 323, file no.
