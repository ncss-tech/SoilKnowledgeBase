    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Jennings and Medora series. Jennings soils have a clay content of more than 33 percent in the lower part of the series control section and formed in loess, a paleosol in till and residuum from black shale. Medora soils do not have a lithic contact in the series control section and formed in loess, loamy material and a paleosol in outwash."

They formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess and the underlying residuum from siltstone. Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Frost-free days range from 170 to 200. Elevation ranges from 105 to 305 meters (345 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and slow or very slow in the fragipan. The potential for surface water runoff is medium to very high.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The classification of this series is placed in the Fragiudult great group, and the subgroup would be Oxyaquic if it was recognized in Soil Taxonomy. Base saturation lab data runs between 24 and 46 percent. Base saturation determined by field kits also shows the base status goes above and below 35 percent, but is dominantly below 35 percent at the critical depth.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon: the zone from 5 to 18 cm (2 to 7 inches) (Ap horizon)\n2) Argillic horizon: the zone from 18 to 147 cm (7 to 58 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3,\n2Btx1, 2Btx2 horizons)\n3) Fragipan: the zone from 79 to 124 cm (31 to 49 inches) (2Btx1 horizon)\n4) Lithic contact: the zone from 163 to 188 cm (64 to 74 inches)\n5) Redoximorphic depletions: the zone from 71 to 163 cm (28 to 64 inches).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data available: Agricultural Experiment Station, Purdue University; Station Bulletin No. 323, file no. WS7903; Station Bulletin No. 360, file no. JN7910; Station Bulletin No. 412, file no. JN8015 (typical pedon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
