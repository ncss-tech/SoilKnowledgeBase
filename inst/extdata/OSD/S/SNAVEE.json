  "OVERVIEW": "The Snavee series consists of very deep well drained soils on hills.  They formed in colluvium derived from limestone.  Slopes range from 10 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 38 centimeters (15 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 117 degrees C. (46 degrees F.)",
