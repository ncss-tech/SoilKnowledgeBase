  "OVERVIEW": "The Surge series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum from basalt surge conglomerate.  Surge soils are on volcanic surge conglomerate rings.  Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
