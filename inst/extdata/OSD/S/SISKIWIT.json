    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to greater than 80 inches, and depth to the B/E horizon ranges from 14 to 39 inches. Cobble content ranges from 0 to 35 percent by volume in the surface layers, and from 0 to 15 percent by volume in the subsoil and substratum. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 25 throughout the soil. Typically stones cover from less than .01 percent of the surface to 0.1 percent of the surface.\nSome pedons have an A horizon. The A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is loamy sand, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or sandy loam, or gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam, or the gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loamy sand, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, sandy loam or the gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bs1 horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loamy sand, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, sandy loam or the gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures. Weakly cemented ortstein is in the Bhs and Bs1 horizons of some pedons. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bs2 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or the gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid. In some pedons individual subhorizons of the Bhs or Bs horizons may be sandy loam, however, the 10 to 40 inch particle size control section averages to sandy.\nThe E part of the B/E horizon is in the form of coatings on the faces of peds of Bt part, but in the E and Bt horizon the two kinds of material are in alternate bands. In the E and Bt horizon, the Bt bands range from 1/8 to 2 inches thick and have a cumulative thickness of greater than 6 inches within a depth of 80 inches. Some pedons have E, Bt, or E/B horizons.\nThe E part of these horizons has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is fine sand, sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures. The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures. The clay content of the argillic horizon ranges from 8 to 15 percent. The B/E horizon may exhibit some characteristics of a fragipan; it is firm when moist and hard when dry and has some brittleness. Reaction of the E/B, E and Bt, E, Bt, or B/E horizon ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. The C horizon ranges from uniform loamy sand to interbedded sand and loamy sand that contains some bands or pockets of sandy loam. Gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures are allowed. It ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Siskiwit soils formed in sandy deposits typically on ground moraines and end moraines, but in some places are on drumlins and islands of till surrounded by outwash. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 33 inches, and the mean annual air temperature from about 41 to 44 degrees F."

The very poorly drained Cathro soils are in depressions and bogs.  The somewhat poorly drained Tula soils and moderately well drained Gogebic soils have a fragipan and are in similar landscape positions. The well drained Keweenaw and the poorly drained Pequaming soils form a drainage sequence and are in similar landscape positions.  The well drained McMillan have a higher sand content, and the somewhat excessively drained Kalkaska lack an argillic horizon and are in similar landscape positions."
