  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 25 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Rock fragments are typically absent, but up to 15 percent fine gravel is present in the C horizon of some pedons. Unless limed, reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon, extremely acid to slightly acid in the B horizon and strongly acid to slightly acid in the C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand or fine sand. Structure is granular and consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6, chroma of 1 through 4, and contains redoximorphic features. At least one subhorizon within 20 inches has a chroma of 2. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sand. It has weak granular, subangular blocky, or platy structure or it is massive. It is friable, very friable, or loose. Thin lamellae, more firm than the matrix, are present in the B horizons of some pedons.\nThe C horizon is neutral, or has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 0 or 3. It is fine sand to sand. It is massive or single grain. Consistency is friable to loose."

Arloval soils receive less rainfall. Barren (T) and Jamaica (T) soils are formed in anthrotransported materials. Carrolls soils have volcanic ash in the particle size control section. Conrad soils are in stratified light and dark colored sands, and contain buried A horizons. Dair (T) and Norway (T) soils have a neutral or more alkaline reaction in the control section. Forbar soils formed in alluvium and lack a B horizon. Gothenburg soils developed in alluvium and receive less rainfall. Junius soils are neutral to moderately alkaline in the lower part of the series control section. Tihonet (T) soils have a thinner solum and have been anthropogenically altered. Tryon soils are slightly alkaline throughout. Tyre soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches. Wanser soils are moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Stafford soils are nearly level soils on sandy deltas and plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The soils developed in glacio-fluvial sand with quartz prominent but with conspicuous amounts of weatherable primary minerals. Mean air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F., mean annual precipitation, from 26 to 50 inches; and mean growing season 130 to 200 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the well drained to excessively drained Colonie and moderately well drained Elnora soils that are associated in a drainage sequence with Stafford. Junius soils are coarser textured and less acid associates. Associates in finer sands are Arkport, Galen, and Minoa soils. Canandaigua, Collamer, Wallington, and Williamson are moderately well drained and are on higher parts of the landscape. In Ohio, the wetter and darker Kingsville soils are associated."
