    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the hard volcanic rock is from 10 to 20 inches.  Base saturation is less than 50 percent in some part of the epipedon or cambic horizons.  CEC is 24 or more meq/100 grams of clay in all horizons to the lithic contact.  Reaction through the solum is strongly or very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has colors of dark brown (7.5YR 3/2, 4/2; 10YR 3/3, 4/3), very dark gray (10YR 3/1), very dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2).  Texture is silty clay loam or clay loam.  Coarse fragments vary from few through common.\nThe B horizon has colors of dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) through brownish yellow (10YR 6/8), brown (7.5YR 4/4) through reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) or reddish brown (5YR 4/4) through reddish yellow (5YR 6/8).  Texture of the B horizon is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  Clay films are thin and very patchy; they do not meet the requirements of an argillic horizon."

The Anones, Mariana, and Santa Marta soils lack hard rock within 20 inches of the surface.  Diamond and Descalabrado soils have dryer soil moisture regimes.  Diamond and Pandura soils have loamy control sections.  Cramer and Tanama soils have argillic horizons, and Cramer soils have mollic epipedons.  Malaya soils have higher base saturation throughout the solum.  Parcelas soils have sola thicker than 20 inches and lack the underlying rock."

The regolith is thin, fine textured residuum of partially weathered volcanic rocks.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual rainfall is 80 to 90 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 77 to 80 degrees F."
