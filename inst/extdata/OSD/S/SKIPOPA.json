Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma 2 through 4 moist and dry.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.  Some pedons have an E horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 7 dry, and chroma 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and averages 12 to 30 percent clay.  Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry and is mottled.

These soils formed in loess underlain by glaciolacustrine sediments.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 50 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 39 degrees F, and mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F.  The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 150 to 200 days."
