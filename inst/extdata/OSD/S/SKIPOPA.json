  "OVERVIEW": "The Skipopa series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess over glaciolacustrine sediments.  Skipopa soils are on terraces and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual  precipitation is about 45 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
