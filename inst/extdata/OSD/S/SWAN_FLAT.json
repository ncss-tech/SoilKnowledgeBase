  "OVERVIEW": "The Swan Flat series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium and/or slope alluvium derived from  limestone or calcareous siltstone.  Swan Flat soils are on north and east slopes of hills, mountains and summits. Slopes are 10 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
