Secondary carbonates may occur as common thin coats in fractures but lime often impregnates the weathering rind of fractured bedrock in the upper three inches of this horizon.  Lime may permeate from 0 to 60 percent of the lithic contact surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shankba soils are on summits and side slopes of hills and mountains.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from very fine grained silty sandstone, siltstones and shale.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 3,000 to 4,100 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool moist winters and hot intermittently moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches; mean annual temperature is 59 to 65 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 180 to 200 days."
