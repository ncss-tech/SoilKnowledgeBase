    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Scorup soils are on alluvial fans and old stream terraces at elevations of 6,200 to 7,000 feet. Slopes are dominantly 2 to 6 percent but range up to 25 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks and some eolian deposits.  The mean annual temperature is 46 degrees to 48 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches. The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."
