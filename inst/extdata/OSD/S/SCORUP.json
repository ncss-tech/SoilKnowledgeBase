  "OVERVIEW": "The Scorup series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and eolian deposits derived from mixed igneous rocks. Scorup soils are on old stream terraces and alluvial fans and have slopes of 2 to 25 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
