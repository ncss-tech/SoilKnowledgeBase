  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is more than 60 to more than 80 inches. There is an abrupt texture change between the ochric epipedon and the underlying argillic horizon. Sodium saturation ranges from 5 to 15 percent in the upper 16 inches of the argillic. It generally increases with depth and may range over 20 percent in the lower part in some pedons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of gray and brown. Reaction is typically strongly acid or moderately acid, but ranges to neutral where limed or affected by irrigation water\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of brown, red and gray. Texture is silt loam or silt. Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid, but areas affected by alkaline irrigation water may range to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Iron accumulations are in shades of brown. Iron and clay depletions are in shades of gray and brown. In some pedons, there is no dominant hue and the horizon is variegated in shades of red, brown and gray. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid.\nThe lower Btg horizons, or Btng horizons where present, have hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of brown, yellow, red, or gray. Black to dark brown manganese accumulations are present in some pedons. Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe BCg, BCtg, BCng, or BCtng horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of brown, yellow, red, or gray. Black to dark brown manganese accumulations are present in some pedons. Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam or clay loam. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Stuttgart soils are on the Grand Prairie of Arkansas and other similar Prairie terraces in the Lower Mississippi Valley, MLRA 131. The terraces are thought to be made up of sediments from the Arkansas River system with a silty mantle from the Mississippi River system. The upper mantle may be mixed with loess in some places. The average annual air temperature ranges from about 60 to 65 degrees F., and average annual precipitation ranges from about 50 to 55 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dewitt, Ethel Immanuel and Tichnor series. Dewitt soils, which occur on similar landscapes, have aquic mositure regimes and are poorly drained. Ethel soils, which occur on level to depressional landscapes are in a fine-silty particle-size family, do not have an\nabrupt texture change and contain a glossic horizon. Immanuel soils typically occur on more disected landscapes around the perimeter of the terrace and on escarpments. They are in a fine-silty particle-size family, do not have an abrupt texture change and contain a glossic horizon. Tichnor soils occur on local floodplains. They are in a fine-silty particle-size family, have ochric epipedons greater than 24 inches thick, do not contain an abrupt texture change and are poorly drained."
