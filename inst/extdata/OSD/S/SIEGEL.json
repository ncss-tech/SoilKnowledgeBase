  "OVERVIEW": "The Siegel series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed on sideslopes of eroded mudflow deposits from welded tuff, limestone and quartzite. Siegel soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 4 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
