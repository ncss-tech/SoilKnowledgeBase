Bearspring, Cherrycreek, Eastpine, Midpeak, Mineral, Scoap, Shalrock and Yellcreek have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Cassal soils are moderately well drained with distinct redox features at 30 to 45 inches. Eastpine, Egyptcreek, Fredonyer, Midpeak, Mineral, Peahke and Shalrock soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Longs soils are 40 to 60 inches deep and have mollic epipedons greater than 20 inches thick. Piersonte soils have mollic epipedons 20 to 35 inches thick and have a pscs dominated by channer shaped rock fragments of shale origin. Umatilla soils have mollic epipedons greater than 20 inches thick and average 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section."
