  "OVERVIEW": "The Shilling series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderate permeability that formed in colluvium from basalt mixed with volcanic ash in the upper part. Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent in mountains. The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Cassal soils are moderately well drained with distinct redox features at 30 to 45 inches. Eastpine, Egyptcreek, Fredonyer, Midpeak, Mineral, Peahke and Shalrock soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Longs soils are 40 to 60 inches deep and have mollic epipedons greater than 20 inches thick. Piersonte soils have mollic epipedons 20 to 35 inches thick and have a pscs dominated by channer shaped rock fragments of shale origin. Umatilla soils have mollic epipedons greater than 20 inches thick and average 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section."
