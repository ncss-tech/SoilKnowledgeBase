The soils formed in very gravelly coarse sandy loam material weathered from granitic rock, principally from Pikes Peak granite but also includes rhyolite and basic andesite.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F.  The frost free season is 75 to 125 days."
