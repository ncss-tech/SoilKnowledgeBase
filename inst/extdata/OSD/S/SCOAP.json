  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Scoap soils are on glaciated uplands, outwash terraces, and mountain slopes at elevations of 455 to 1,465 meters. Slopes are 5 to 65 percent. Soils are influenced by loess and volcanic ash at the surface, and formed in colluvium, outwash and till. Scoap soils are in a continental climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 375 to 650 mm. Mean annual temperature is 5.0 to 7.2 degrees C. The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."

Dehart soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are on mountains. Aits soils are on glaciated mountains. Donavan soils are on toeslopes, footslopes, and backslopes of mountains. Inkler soils have an admixture of volcanic ash in the upper part of the particle-size control section with a bulk density of 0.85 to 0.95 g/cc and are on foothills and mountains. Maki and Raisio soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to a lithic contact and Maki soils are also calcareous. Maki soils are on south-facing glaciated uplands and mountain sides. Rufus soils are 25 to 50 cm deep to a lithic contact. Raisio, Rufus, and Stevens soils are on south-facing sideslopes and ridgetops of mountains."
