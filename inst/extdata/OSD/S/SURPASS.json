  "OVERVIEW": "The Surpass series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Surpass soils are on alluvial fans and fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
