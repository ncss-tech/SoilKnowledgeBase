    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks such as granite and andesite.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,300 to 1,950 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 350 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
