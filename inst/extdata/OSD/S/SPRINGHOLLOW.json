Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  Elevations range from 5,800 to 7,500 feet.  The soil formed in mixed alluvium with some silty alluvium from loess.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 18 inches, the average annual air temperature is 37 to 43 degrees F and the frost free season is 70 to 90 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arbone, Niter, Thatcher and Vicking soils.  All of these series lack duripans and they are very deep.  Arbone soils are in slightly concave areas around and interspersed with Springhollow soils.  Niter soils are on smooth to concave slopes on ridge sideslopes and hillslopes.  Thatcher and Vicking soils are on nearly level undulating areas to moderately steep hillslopes, generally lower on the landscape than Springhollow soils."
