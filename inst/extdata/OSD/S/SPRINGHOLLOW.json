  "OVERVIEW": "The Springhollow series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium. They are on dissected plateaus, ridge tops and hillsides.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Thatcher and Vicking soils are on nearly level undulating areas to moderately steep hillslopes, generally lower on the landscape than Springhollow soils."
