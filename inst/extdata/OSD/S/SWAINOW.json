  "OVERVIEW": "The Swainow series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from basalt, andesite and volcanic ash.  Swainow soils are on plateaus and mountain back slopes and have slopes of 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The thickness of the solum and depth to a lithic or paralithic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The soil moisture control section (10 to 35 inches) is dry in all parts from August 1 to November 1 (90 days) and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the time.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from May 1 to December 1 and exceeds 47 degrees F from June 1 to November 1.  Rock fragments on the surface range from 5 to 20 percent stones; 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 20 to 40 percent gravel.  The bulk density at 1/3 bar moisture ranges from 0.7 to 1.1 g/cc.\nThe A and AB horizon is 10YR 4/4; 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 4/6, 5/6; 5YR 4/6 or 5/6.  Moist colors are 5YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4 or 4/4.  Rock fragments ranges from 5 to 60 percent stones, 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 15 to 50 percent gravel.  Sodium fluoride pH ranges from 10.0 to 11.0.  Base saturation by sum of cations ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  The moist chroma of the upper 7 inches, when mixed, is greater than 3.5.\nThe 2Bt horizon is 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6; 5YR 5/4 or 5/6.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6; 5YR 4/4 or 4/6.  It has 18 to 27 percent clay modified by 40 to 70 percent rock fragments mostly cobbles and gravel.  Reaction is medium or slightly acid.  Sodium fluoride pH ranges from less than 9.0 to 10.3 and decreases with depth.
