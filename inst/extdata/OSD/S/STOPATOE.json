  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stopatoe soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on summit and shoulder positions.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 2,505 to 3,510 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 460 mm, mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."

It may classify in the Vitrandic subgroup of Argicryolls and have isotic mineralogy and ashy texture modifiers.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 36 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 36 to 79 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 79 cm to underlying soft, weathered bedrock (Cr layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 36 to 79 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization data for a similar soil is available as SSL pedon 78P0566.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
