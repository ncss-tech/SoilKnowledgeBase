  "OVERVIEW": "The Stopatoe series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks.  Stopatoe soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
