  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sagley soils are on strongly sloping to steep north facing slopes of canyons.  Elevations are 1800 to 3000 feet.  Slopes are 12 to 55 percent.  The soil formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from basalt with an influence of loess in the surface.  The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."
