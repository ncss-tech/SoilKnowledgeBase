  "OVERVIEW": "The Sagley series consists of deep, well drained soils on canyons.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from basalt with an influence of loess in the surface.  Slopes are 12 to 55 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
