  "OVERVIEW": "The Scroggin series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in calcareous loamy residuum weathered from siltstone, sandstone or shale on uplands. Slopes range from 6 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Carbonates typically are at the surface but may be leached from the A horizon in some pedons. The CaCO3 equivalent ranges from 10 to 20 percent throughout the pedon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 moist.  It is loam, silt loam or clay loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk, BCk and C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 or 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. They typically are loam, but is silt loam or clay loam in some pedons.  They are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. The Bk and BCk horizons are not calcic.  Some pedons do not have Bk or BCk horizons.\nThe Cr horizon typically is siltstone or sandstone, but is silty or sandy shale in some pedons."

The solum consists of silt loam or poorly graded loam materials weathered from the underlying weakly consolidated siltstones or sandstones of Cretaceous or Tertiary Age.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 15 inches with more than 70 percent falling in months of May through September. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 120 to 130 days."
