  "OVERVIEW": "The Solite series consists of deep, poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils.  They formed in homogeneous sandy spoil from mining operations.  The soils have been reworked and shaped by earth moving equipment.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  They are saturated during the summer rainy season and after heavy rainfall in other seasons.",

Texture is fine sand or sand throughout the pedon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 4 or less.  If color value is 2 or 3, it is less than 6 inches thick.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 7, and chroma of 6 or less.  Low chromas indicative of wetness occur in the upper 20 inches of the soil.  Color stratification is evident in many pedons."
