  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches but is commonly less than 25 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid except for surface layers that have\nbeen limed.  Few to common thin to very thick flat fragments and cobbles occur through the solum in most pedons.  Hardness of fragments is less than 3 on Moh's scale.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.  Most pedons with silty clay loam surface layers are eroded.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 8, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, silt loam, or loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8, or is mottled with hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, and 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 8, or has a matrix color in the same hue, value, and chroma as above, and has many mottles of two or more of the other colors.  Texture is clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon is mottled with hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, and 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 6, or has a matrix color in hue, value, and chroma as above with common to many mottles of two or more of the other colors.  Texture is clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.\nThe BC, CB, or C horizons are mottled in hue of 2.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 8, or have a matrix in hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value and chroma as above and common\nto many red, brown, and gray mottles.  They contain from 20 to 80 percent thin to very thick flat fragments and cobbles of fossiliferous claystone.  Fine earth material with textures of silty clay loam, clay loam, clay, or sandy clay fills the cracks between fragments of rock."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Iredell and Kisatchie series. These soils have yellower hue.  Other similar soils include the Arundel, Boswell, Luverne, Sunsweet, and Susquehanna series. Arundel and Luverne soils have mixed mineralogy and lack gray mottles in the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon.  Boswell and Susquehanna soils have thicker sola and higher shrink-swell properties.  Sunsweet soils have thicker sola and kaolinitic mineralogy.  In addition, all these soils lack fragments of fossiliferous claystone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shadygrove soils are on very gently undulating to strongly rolling erosional surfaces on Coastal Plain uplands.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent but are commonly 5 to 12 percent.  These soils formed in beds of fossiliferous marine sediments locally called \"burhstone\" and \"sandy claystone.\"   The climate is warm and humid."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Lucy, Luverne, Orangeburg, and Troup series.  These soils formed in beds of unconsolidated sediments overlying the older, more consolidated \"burhstone\" or claystone sediments from which Shadygrove soils were derived.  Luverne soils occur in the same landscape as Shadygrove soils.  Lucy, Orangeburg, and Troup soils are well drained loamy upland soils and typically have simple convex slopes.  Shadygrove soils commonly have both concave and convex slopes."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Moderate to rapid runoff.  Slow permeability.  Water moves slowly laterally through the C horizons during wet periods causing seep areas along lower side slopes."

Native vegetation consists mainly of loblolly pine and mixed hardwoods with an understory consisting mostly of dogwood, sweetgum, and gallberry."
