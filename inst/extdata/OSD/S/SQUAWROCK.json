The soil is dry between a depth of 10 and 31 inches or lithic contact from June to October, in most years, and usually moist the rest of the year.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 62 degrees F.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 6/4, 6/3, 6/2, 5/4 or 5/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/4, 4/3, 3/3, 3/2; or 7.5YR 3/4.  Moist values greater than 3 occur in the lower A horizon below 4 inches.  Particle size is sandy loam or loam, and is gravelly or cobbly.  Clay content is 12 to 25 percent.  It is strongly acid to neutral and base saturation (sum of cations) ranges from 50 to 90 percent.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 35 percent.  Organic matter is 1 to 2 percent.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 7/4, 7/2, 6/3, 6/4. 6/2 or 5/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 5/4, 4/3, 4/2, 3/3, 3/4; or 7.5YR 4/4.

They formed in material weathered from sandstone or graywacke at elevations of 350 to 4,000 feet.  The soils usually occur on south or west facing slopes at elevations above 2,500 feet.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 44 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 72 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 54 degrees to 59 degrees F.  Frost- free period ranges from 130 to 250 days."
