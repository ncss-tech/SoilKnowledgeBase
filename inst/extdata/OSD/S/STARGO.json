  "OVERVIEW": "The Stargo series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Stargo soils are on fan skirts, offshore bars, lake plains, alluvial flats and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
