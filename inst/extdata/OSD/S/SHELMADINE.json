  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F. Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches and depth to the fragipan ranges from 18 to 30 inches; bedrock is below 5 feet. Rock fragments of shale, angular or subrounded sandstone or quartzite, up to 5 inches in diameter, range from 5 to 25 percent\nin the solum and 15 to 80 percent in the C horizon. The soil ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid throughout, where unlimed. The most common clay mineral is illite but the soils contain significant amounts of vermiculite and kaolinite.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.Some pedons have an A horizon with value of 2 through 4, and an E horizon with value of 4 through 7. Texture is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 1 through 4 with common to many high chroma mottles. Faces of peds have coatings with chroma of 2 or less. The Bt horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction and contains 22 to 35 percent clay and 45 to 65 percent silt in the particle-size control section. It has weak or moderate fine to coarse subangular or angular blocky structure of medium or coarse prismatic structure parting to subangular blocky. Some pedons have a BA or BE horizon. The Bx horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. Mottles and coatings on faces of peds are similar to the Bt horizon. Texture is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has moderate\nvery coarse prismatic structure parting to thick or medium platy or medium blocky structure. It is firm or very firm and brittle.\nThe C horizon ranges from gray to brown and contains few to many gray and strong brown mottles. It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction and is massive or has weak medium platy structure."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nearly level to moderately sloping soils on upland flats, depressions, drainageways and stream heads. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. The soil formed in pre-Wisconsin age glacial or periglacial material derived from shale, siltstone, and sandstone. The climate is humid temperate; mean annual precipitation ranges from\n34 to 48 inches, mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F., and the frost-free season from ranges 130 to 170 days."

The well drained Berks or Gilpin soils and moderately well drained Comly soils are on nearby uplands."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 9 inches (Ap horizon).\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 9 to 22 inches (Btg horizon). 3. Fragipan - the zone\nfrom 22 to 46 inches (Bxg horizon).\nThe 10/2005 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). The CEC activity class placement is based on laboratory data. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available.\nCompeting series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms, redoximorphic features, etc), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.Previous revision dates: 8/86\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
