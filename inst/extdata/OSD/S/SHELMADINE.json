  "OVERVIEW": "The Shelmadine series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in pre-Wisconsin glacial till or periglacial materials. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low. Mean annual precipitation is 1040 millimeters. Mean annual temperature is 9.5 degrees C.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 100 to 150 centimeters and depth to the fragipan ranges from 46 to 76 centimeters; bedrock is below 150 centimeters. Rock fragments of shale, angular or subrounded sandstone or quartzite, up to 5 inches in diameter, range from 5 to 25 percent in the solum and 15 to 80 percent in the C horizon. The soil ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid throughout, where unlimed. The most common clay mineral is illite but the soils contain significant amounts of vermiculite and kaolinite.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.Some pedons have an A horizon with value of 2 through 4, and an E horizon with value of 4 through 7. Texture is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 1 through 4 with common to many high chroma mottles. Faces of peds have coatings with chroma of 2 or less. The Bt horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction and contains 22 to 35 percent clay and 45 to 65 percent silt in the particle-size control section. It has weak or moderate fine to coarse subangular or angular blocky structure of medium or coarse prismatic structure parting to subangular blocky. Some pedons have a BA or BE horizon.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. Mottles and coatings on faces of peds are similar to the Bt horizon. Texture is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has moderate\nvery coarse prismatic structure parting to thick or medium platy or medium blocky structure. It is firm or very firm and brittle.\nThe C horizon ranges from gray to brown and contains few to many gray and strong brown mottles. It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction and is massive or has weak medium platy structure."

Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available.\n5/2025 revision converted to metric, updated horizon nomenclature and terminology, and updated competing series. A new typical pedon with better location information should be selected. Previous revision dates: 8/86"
