Depth to very gravelly or extremely gravelly IIC horizon is 24 to 50 inches.  Coarse fragments in the A and B horizons range from 0 to 10 percent pebbles.  The B3 horizon and upper part of the C horizon have 0 to 20 percent pebbles; and the IIC horizon has 35 to 60 percent pebbles.  Some pedons have brown (10YR 5/3) loam or silt loam A1 horizons.  The B3cs and C1ca horizons have 5 to 15 percent calcium carbonate.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is mainly loam or silt loam.  Some cultivated areas are silty clay loam, or clay loam.  This horizon is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It averages silty clay or clay.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline. Some pedons contain a B3ca horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The upper part of the C horizon in some pedons is silty clay, clay, or gravelly clay loam.  The IIC horizon is very gravelly clay loam, very gravelly loam or very gravelly sandy loam.   The C horizon is mildly or moderately alkaline."

They formed in loamy alluvium from mixed rock origin.  The climate is cool semiarid, continental, with cold dry winters and moist springs.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 41 to 47 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 17 inches, most of which falls during spring and early summer.  The (32 degrees F.) growing season is 105 to 125 days."
