The soils formed in mixed alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  Some areas have been leveled but the natural microrelief is hummocky.  Elevations are 90 to 100 feet.  The climate is semiarid mesothermal with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F. Frost-free season is about 210 to 280 days."
