  "OVERVIEW": "The Sumeadow series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from andesite, tuff, or tuff-breccia.  Sumeadow soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
