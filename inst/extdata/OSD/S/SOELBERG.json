  "OVERVIEW": "The Soelberg series consists of very deep, well drained soils that  formed in lacustrine sediments over flood deposited sand and gravel.  Soelberg soils are on terraces.  Permeability is moderately slow in the  upper part and very rapid in the lower part.  Slopes are 0 to 12  percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the  average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
