  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Avant, Bigfork, Cobstone, Lillington, Steprock, and Zafra series. Avant soils are 20 to 40 inches to hard, fractured, tilted and folded, chert bedrock. Bigfork soils are 20 to 50 inches to hard chert or novaculite that is tilted 20 degrees to 60 degrees from the horizontal. Cobstone soils developed in fluvial sediments; typically have browner hues in the argillic horizon, and the rock fragments are dominantly cobbles and stones. Lillington soils developed in fluvial sediments and have sola more than 60 inches thick. Steprock soils are subactive, and are 20 to 40 inches to weathered and hard sandstone bedrock. Zafra soils are 20 to 56 inches to soft and hard interbedded sandstone and shale bedrock that is tilted 20 degrees to 60 degrees from the horizontal."

Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. This soil formed in loamy and gravelly marine sediments of Tertiary Age. The average annual temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 66 degrees F., and average annual precipitation ranges from 48 to 54 inches."
