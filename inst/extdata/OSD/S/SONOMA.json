  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sonoma soils are on low stream terraces, flood plains, lake plains, and alluvial flats.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,160 to 1,910 meters.  The climate is arid or semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Poorly drained but most areas of these soils have altered drainage and are now somewhat poorly drained; medium or high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 40 and 90 cm (shallow and moderately deep free water occurrence classes) between February and June or 100 to 150 cm (deep free water occurrence class) between December and May.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  Some areas have a water table under artesian pressure.  These soils are susceptible to flooding that ranges from rare flooding for very brief periods year-round to frequent flooding for long periods between December and June."
