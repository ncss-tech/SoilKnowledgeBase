  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches thick.  Thickness of solum and depth to fragmental substratums range from 20 to 40 inches.  These soils are slightly acid or neutral throughout.  Organic carbon ranges from .7 to 3 percent in the mollic epipedon and decreases uniformly with increasing depth in the profile.  The soil is 80 to 100 percent base saturated, but there is no visible secondary calcium carbonate accumulation.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 and are mainly stones more than 10 inches in diameter.  The average annual soil temperature is 38 degrees F. and the average annual summer soil temperature is 52 degrees F., without an 0 horizon.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of neutral through 2.  It is soft or slightly hard.  Typically, this horizon has a granular or crumb structure but it has subangular blocky structure in some pedons.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Typically, it has weak platy structure, but it has subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  This horizon is soft or slightly hard.  The B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 5.  It is typically light clay or heavy clay loam but the matrix material ranges from 35 to 50 percent clay.  Typically, this horizon has subangular blocky structure but it has weak prismatic structure in some pedons."

The soils formed in very stony sediments weathered from highly fractured rhyolite or rhyolitic tuff.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 20 inches and peak periods of precipitation occur during the spring and summer."
