    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist and are dry between depths of 8 and 24 inches for a short period of less than 45 consecutive days after the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 52 degrees F. The depth to bedrock dominantly is greater than 60 inches but ranges to 40 inches. Thickness of the solum ranges from 10 to 24 inches. Rock fragments in the texture control section range from 35 to 70 percent. The field estimated clay content is 10 to 18 percent.  The solum is estimated to have acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent and less than 2.0 cmol per kg fine earth of 1N KCL extractable aluminum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry. The upper part of the A horizon commonly has 5YR hue.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry. It has weak or moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. The lower part of the C horizon is firm or very firm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sahalie soils are on hillsides in glaciated valleys of the Cascade Mountains at elevations of 1,000 to 3,000 feet. Slopes range from 5 to 80 percent. The soils formed in medium textured glacial till of late Pleistocene origin and weathered primarily from rocks of the Cascade Andesite formation (olivine basalts and olivine-bearing andesites) although weathered material from the Rhododendron formation (tuffs, breccias and agglomerates) and Columbia River basalt formation is present in some areas. The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 80 to 120 inches, falling as rain in the fall and spring, and snow in the winter. Rainfall amounts are relatively low in the summer. The mean January temperature is 34 degrees F. The mean July temperature is 64 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F."
