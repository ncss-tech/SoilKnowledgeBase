  "OVERVIEW": "The Shirts series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 4 to 90 percent in  mountains, canyons and intermontane basins. The average annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
