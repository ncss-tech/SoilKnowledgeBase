  "REVDATE": "12/2005",
  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Senlar series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvial sediments derived from siltstone.  These soils are on alluvial fans, terraces, and hillslopes.  Slopes are simple and typically 0 to 6 percent but may range to 15 percent where these surfaces have been dissected.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Senlar soils are typically calcareous throughout due to intermittent recharge of carbonates but may be leached as deep as 6 inches in some pedons.  Thin vesicular crusting occurs in many pedons.  Depth to the base of the cambic horizon ranges from 13 to 29 inches.  Gravel content averages 0 to 5 percent.  The particle size control section averages from 18 to 35 percent clay, 60 to 70 percent silt, and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. Thin discontinuous bands of up to 30 percent gravel may occur below 40 inches.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F., which occurs about April 21 to 27. It is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days between July 15 to October 25.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days.  EC is 0 to 4 mmhos.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Textures are silt loam or silty clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay, 65 to 80 percent silt and very fine sand, and less than 15 percent fine and coarser sand.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is dominantly silt loam, but is very fine sandy loam in the lower part in some pedons.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 3 to 10 percent. Secondary carbonate accumulations in the form of few to common filaments and soft masses occur throughout this horizon.  EC is 1 to 4 mmhos.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Senlar soils are on alluvial fans, fan terraces, and hillslopes. The soils formed in silty low energy alluvial sediments of Holocene age derived primarily from siltstone and fine grained sandstone.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Elevations are 3,800 to 4,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches, about half of which falls in April, May, and early June and less than one inch in each month of July, August, and September.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 130 days."
