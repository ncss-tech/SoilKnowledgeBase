    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist but dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the moisture control section during the four month period following the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F., the mean summer soil temperature is 40 to 47 degrees F. and without an O horizon is 52 to 59 degrees F., and the mean winter soil temperature is 32 to 35 degrees F. The upper part of the particle size control section contains 60 to 90 percent volcanic glass and glass-coated aggregates, phosphate retention of 25 to 50 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 0.9 percent, 15-bar moisture of 4 to 7 percent on both dried and undried samples, moist bulk density of 0.70 to 1.00 grams per cubic centimeter, field estimated clay of 0 to 5 percent, and averages 5 to 35 percent pumice fragments. Depth to the contrasting 2B horizon is 20 to 40 inches. The lower part of the particle size control section averages 40 to 70 percent basalt rock fragments. Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons lack an O horizon.\nThe A horizon, AC horizon (when present) and Bw horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. The fine-earth texture is ashy loamy coarse sand, or ashy loamy sand with 0 to 35 percent gravel-size pumice and 40 to 60 percent coarse ash (0.5 to 2.0mm).\nThe BC horizon and c horizon (when present) has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 8 moist, 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 8 moist and dry. The fine-earth texture is ashy loamy coarse sand or ashy coarse sand with 0 to 60 percent gravel-size pumice and 60 to 90 percent coarse ash (0.5 to 2.0mm).\nThe 2Bwb horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. The fine-earth texture is loam or sandy loam with estimated clay of 10 to 20 percent. It has 5 to 70 percent and 20 to 60 percent stones or cobbles. Total rock fragments range from 40 to 70 percent."
