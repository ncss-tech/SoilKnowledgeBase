  "OVERVIEW": "The Shadeleaf series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils of slow permeability that formed in material weathered from ultramafic rocks.  Shadeleaf soils are on mountains and have slopes of 20 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is 51 degrees F.",
