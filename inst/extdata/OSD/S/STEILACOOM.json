    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Steilacoom soils are on glacial drift plains at elevations ranging from near sea level to about 100 meters. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in concavities in relict glacial lacustrine sediments. These soils occur in a mild marine climate. Summers are cool and dry and winters are mild and wet. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 1067 to 1219 millimeters. The mean January temperature is 2 degrees C., mean July temperature is 24 degrees C., and mean annual temperature is 9.4 degrees C. The frost-free season is 200 to 240 days."

Alderwood soils have a dense horizon and are loamy-skeletal. Everett soils are sandy-skeletal.  Indianola soils are sandy."
