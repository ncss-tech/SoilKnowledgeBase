Elevations range from 1,400 to 1,465 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 76 and 100 cm (moderately deep free water occurrence class) from December to May.  These soils probably formed under a wetter moisture regime.  However, surface and groundwater hydrology have been altered by stream entrenchment and man-caused alterations higher in the watershed."
