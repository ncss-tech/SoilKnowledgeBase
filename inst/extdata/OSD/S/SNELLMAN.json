  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates typically ranges from 20 to 40 inches, but some pedons are leached to 55 inches.  These soils typically have 2 to 15 percent gravel throughout the profile.  The soil moisture control section is not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days in most years.\nThe A and Ap horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have either an EB, B/E with the E part being less than 15 percent, or BE transitional horizon with some characteristics of both horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is typically sandy clay loam but includes fine sandy loam, loam, sandy loam or clay loam.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid. The sand content ranges from 45 to 70 percent and the clay content ranges from 18 to 30 percent.\nThe Bk and C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 20 percent. The sand content ranges from 45 to 70 percent and the clay content ranges from 7 to 18 percent."

The Alderon, Allens Park, Bayerton, Bonfri, Elmark (T), Fairport, Gateson, Lumpgulch (T), and Rule(T) soils have a lithic or paralithic contact within depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Elbeth soils are strongly acid to neutral throughout the series control section and contain less than 1 percent calcium carbonate.  Bondoe, Haugan, Foreleft, and Lakoa are dry soils in some or all parts of the soil moisture control section for more than 90 cumulative days in most years.   Lengby soils have stratified sandy and loamy material in the lower part of the series control section.  Nebish soils have less than 45 percent sand in the Bt and C horizons.  Onaway soils have Bs horizons and redder hues in Bt horizons.  Ferball soils have redder hues in the Bt horizons.   Plome soils have hue of 5YR or redder throughout the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Snellman soils have very gently sloping to very steep convex slopes on ground and end moraines in uplands.  The slope gradients range from 1 to 50 percent.  The soils formed primarily in a loamy glacial till of Wisconsin Age.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 26 inches.  Frost-free days range from 100 to 145.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 1000 to 1800 feet."
