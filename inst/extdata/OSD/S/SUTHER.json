  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils have ochric epipedons (thickness and/or high values and chromas, dry or moist) and argillic horizons.  Solum thickness is 24 to 45 inches to bedrock and mean annual soil temperature ranges from 52 to 55 degrees F.  Mineralogy is mixed and the soils are dry most years for more than 60 consecutive days.\nThe A horizon colors dry are in 10YR and 7.5YR hues and have values of 5 or 6.  Moist hues also are 10YR and 7.5YR and values are 2 to 4.  Chromas are 2 or 3 dry and moist.  Texture ranges from loam to gravelly loam, structure from weak to moderate subangular blocky, consistence from slightly hard to hard and friable,  and reaction from slightly acid to medium acid.\nThe B horizon colors are in 10YR and 7.5YR hues with values of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, chromas are 3 to 6.\nThe Bt horizons have many fine distinct dark mottles.  Texture ranges from gravelly clay to gravelly heavy clay loam.  Structure is massive or weak coarse prismatic to angular blocky, and consistence is very hard, very firm, sticky and very plastic.  Reaction is medium to strongly acid."

The climate is subhumid mesothermal with mean annual rainfall of 35 to 50 inches, and with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 52 to 55 degrees F., average January temperature about 48 degrees F., and average July temperature about 62 degrees F. Frost-free season is about 200 to 300 days."
