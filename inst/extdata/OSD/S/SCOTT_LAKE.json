  "OVERVIEW": "The Scott Lake series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils which are moderately deep to sandy outwash.  They formed in loamy alluvium over sandy outwash on outwash plains, glacial drainageways, stream terraces, glacial lake basins, and outwash areas on moraines.  Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy mantle and rapid or very rapid in the sandy outwash.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the loamy mantle, depth to the base of the argillic horizon, and depth to sandy outwash range from 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 8 to 17 percent clay and 50 percent or more fine sand or coarser.  Volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the loamy mantle but is typically less than 15 percent.  The volume of gravel in the sandy outwash ranges from 3 to 50 percent as a weighted average, and from 0 to 60 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the loamy mantle and from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy outwash.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the substratum.  Redox accumulations are within a depth of 40 inches.  Saturation occurs within a depth of 40 inches in most years.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Horizons with value moist of 3 have value dry of 6 or more. Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture of the Ap or A horizon is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nScott Lake soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has colors and textures like the E horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 4 or 6.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bt horizon has colors and textures like the Bt part described above.\nSome pedons have a 2Bt horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nThe 2C horizon has color like the 2Bt horizon above. It is typically stratified sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs but some pedons have thin subhorizons of loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs. Sand content averages more than 90 percent in the fine earth fraction."

None of thses soils except Sconsin, Antigo, Rosholt, and Scoba, have more than 90 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Sconsin soils have a silty mantle 12 to 36 inches thick and have a densic contact in the series control section above the contact with the sandy outwash. Freeon soils do not have stratified sandy outwash with more than 85 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Antigo soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and do not have redox accumulations.  Rosholt soils do not have redox accumulations or saturation within 60 inches.  Scoba soils do not have a water table but have a zone of near-saturation with redox features due to contrasting porosity at the sandy outwash contact."

The well drained Rosholt soils, the somewhat poorly drained Oesterle soils, and the poorly drained Minocqua soils form a drainage sequence with the Scott Lake soils. In some areas, the somewhat poorly drained Halder soils are near the Scott Lake soils in slightly lower landscape positions where there is more clay and less silt in the soil."
