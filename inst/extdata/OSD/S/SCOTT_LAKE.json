  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the loamy mantle, depth to the base of the argillic horizon, and depth to sandy outwash range from 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 8 to 17 percent clay and 50 percent or more fine sand or coarser.  Volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the loamy mantle but is typically less than 15 percent.  The volume of gravel in the sandy outwash ranges from 3 to 50 percent as a weighted average, and from 0 to 60 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the loamy mantle and from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy outwash.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the substratum.  Redox accumulations are within a depth of 40 inches.  Saturation occurs within a depth of 40 inches in most years.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Horizons with value moist of 3 have value dry of 6 or more. Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture of the Ap or A horizon is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nScott Lake soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has colors and textures like the E horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 4 or 6.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bt horizon has colors and textures like the Bt part described above.\nSome pedons have a 2Bt horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nThe 2C horizon has color like the 2Bt horizon above. It is typically stratified sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs but some pedons have thin subhorizons of loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs. Sand content averages more than 90 percent in the fine earth fraction."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aftad, Blowers, Freeon, Frogcreek, Milaca, Neopit, and and Sconsin series.  Closely related are the Antigo, Rosholt, and Scoba, series.  None of thses soils except Sconsin, Antigo, Rosholt, and Scoba, have more than 90 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Sconsin soils have a silty mantle 12 to 36 inches thick and have a densic contact in the series control section above the contact with the sandy outwash. Freeon soils do not have stratified sandy outwash with more than 85 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Antigo soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and do not have redox accumulations.  Rosholt soils do not have redox accumulations or saturation within 60 inches.  Scoba soils do not have a water table but have a zone of near-saturation with redox features due to contrasting porosity at the sandy outwash contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on outwash plains, glacial drainageways, stream terraces, glacial lake basins, and outwash areas on moraines.  These soils formed in loamy alluvium 20 to 40 inches thick over stratified sand and gravelly outwash.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.   Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period range from about 90 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 800 to 1950 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Halder, Minocqua, Oesterle, and Rosholt soils.  The well drained Rosholt soils, the somewhat poorly drained Oesterle soils, and the poorly drained Minocqua soils form a drainage sequence with the Scott Lake soils. In some areas, the somewhat poorly drained Halder soils are near the Scott Lake soils in slightly lower landscape positions where there is more clay and less silt in the soil."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  The potential for surface runoff ranges from negligible to medium. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy mantle and rapid or very rapid in the sandy outwash.  Scott lake soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of 2.5 to 3.5 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period October to May in 6 or more out of 10 years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",

Common trees are sugar maple, white ash, American basswood, northern red oak, eastern white pine, quaking aspen, big tooth aspen, yellow birch, and black cherry."
