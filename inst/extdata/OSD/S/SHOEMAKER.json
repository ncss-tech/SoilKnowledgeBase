Allens Park soils have hues as yellow as 2.5Y and are moderately deep to granite.  Alderon, Elmark, Lumpgulch soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Belltower, Elbeth, Elbuck, Haugan, Heflin, Hoyt, Kunz, Kwiavu, Littlepine, Losindios, Northrim, Plome, Rule, and Sweetweed soils are very deep.  Bayerton and Jemco soils are well drained and do not have redox features.  Jemez soils are moderately deep to tuff. Tunitcha soils are deep to shale."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Shoemaker soils are on summits of plateaus, mesas, and hills, and dipslopes of cuestas. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. They occur at elevations of 7,000 to 7,600 feet. These soils formed in reworked alluvium, slope alluvium and eolian material derived from sandstone and shale. The mean annual temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from about 16 to 20 inches. The frost free period is about 90 to 110 days."

Stout soils are shallow to sandstone and lack an argillic horizon. Valnor soils are fine textured and less than 40 inches to a paralithic contact. Techado soils lack an argillic horizon and are shallow to shale. Trag and Millpaw soils have a mollic epipedon and are deep."
