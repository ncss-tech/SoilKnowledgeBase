  "OVERVIEW": "The Shoemaker series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in reworked alluvium, slope alluvium and eolian material derived from sandstone and shale on summits of plateaus, mesas, and hills, and dipslopes of cuestas. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Belltower, Elbeth, Elbuck, Haugan, Heflin, Hoyt, Kunz, Kwiavu, Littlepine, Losindios, Northrim, Plome, Rule, and Sweetweed soils are very deep.  Bayerton and Jemco soils are well drained and do not have redox features.  Jemez soils are moderately deep to tuff. Tunitcha soils are deep to shale."
