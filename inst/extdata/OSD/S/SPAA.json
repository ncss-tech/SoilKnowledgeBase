  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is 10 to 20 inches deep over laminated travertine deposits. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 17 inches thick. The mean annual soil temperature is about 45F. and the mean summer temperature about 63 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the 7 to 20 inch section or to the bedrock for more than 60 consecutive days in more than 7 out of 10 years.\nThe Al horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3. It has weak or moderate coarse blocky structure that parts to moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure. This horizon is mildly or moderately alkaline and is slightly calcareous or noncalcareous.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 and 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loam or silt loam and contains few to 20 percent gravel size travertine fragments, Weak accumulations of soft lime occur as veins and splotches. The travertine bedrock restrict roots and water penetration."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Spaa soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep terraces at elevations of 5,500 to 5,800 feet. They formed in residuum derived from travertine deposits. The climate is moist subhumid with an average precipitation of 16 to 20 inches falling mostly as snow. The mean annual temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is about 63 degrees F. The frost free period is 70 to 90 days"
