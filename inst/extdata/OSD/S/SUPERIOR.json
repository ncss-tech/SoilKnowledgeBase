    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum  ranges from 24 to more than 80 inches. Depth to free carbonates ranges fron 24 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the loamy mantle over the clayey deposits ranges from 14 to 24 inches.  The loamy upper part of the control section averages between 10 and 18 percent clay and between 35 and 65 percent fine sand or coarser.  The clayey lower part of the control section averages between 40 and 80 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the loamy mantle and from 0 to 5 percent in the clayey deposits.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 1 to 3.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture of the A or Ap is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Some pedons do not have an A horizon.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value or 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam but in some pedons it is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Redoxomorphic features are present. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a Bhs horizon with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  Redoxomorphic features are present. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4. Redoxomorphic features are present.\nIt has textures and reaction like the Bhs horizon described above.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nSuperior soils have a glossic horizon (2E/B or 2B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has color, texture, and reaction like the E' horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR and value and chroma of 4 or 5.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay, or clay and is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 5.  It is clay or silty clay.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Btk horizon has colors and textures similar to the 2Bt horizon.  It is violently effervescent and slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value and chroma of 4 or 5.  It typically is silty clay or clay. It may contain  thin strata of silt or sandy clay.  Reaction is  moderately alkaline."

These soils formed in loamy water-laid deposits and in the underlying clayey glacial till and/or clayey lacustrine deposits modified by wave action. Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  The frost free period ranges from about 90 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 600 to 1100 feet."

Sedgwick soils are on slightly lower landscape positions than the Superior soils, and are somewhat poorly drained.  Manistee and Kellogg soils are in landscape positions similar to those of Superior soils where there is a 20 to 40 inch thick sandy mantle over the clayey deposits.Odanah, Sandborg and Badriver soils are nearby in similar landscape positions where the loamy mantle over the clayey deposits is absent."

Permeability is moderate in the loamy deposit and very slow in the clayey deposit.  Superior soils have a perched seasonal water table above the clay till at a depth of 0.5 to 2.0 feet for 20 or more consecutive days or 30 or more cumulative days per year, at some time during the period of September to June in 6 or more out of 10 normal years."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - 0 to 6 inches (A,E); albic horizon - 3 to 6 inches (E); spodic horizon - 6 to 14 inches (Bs1, Bs2); argillic horizon - 14 to 26 inches (2B/E, 2Bt).\nOn June 6, 2003 this site was revisited.  Redoxomorphic features were observed in the upper layers and the vegetation species present indicated moderately well drained conditions.  Redoxomorphic features were added to the E, Bs1, and Bs2 horizons, and the series was reclassified to Oxyaquic. On July 8, 2005 this site was revisited again.  The site was dug and described to 80 inches (it was previously only described to 60 inches) and the lower horizons were revised.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Record - WI0019; WI0519 (LOAMY SUBSTRATUM).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
