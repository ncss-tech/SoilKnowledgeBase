  "OVERVIEW": "The Superior series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy water-laid deposits and in the underlying clayey glacial till and/or clayey lacustrine deposits modified by wave action.  Permeability is moderate in the loamy mantle and very slow in the underlying clayey deposits. Slopes range 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean air annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Redoxomorphic features were observed in the upper layers and the vegetation species present indicated moderately well drained conditions.  Redoxomorphic features were added to the E, Bs1, and Bs2 horizons, and the series was reclassified to Oxyaquic. On July 8, 2005 this site was revisited again.  The site was dug and described to 80 inches (it was previously only described to 60 inches) and the lower horizons were revised.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Record - WI0019; WI0519 (LOAMY SUBSTRATUM).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
