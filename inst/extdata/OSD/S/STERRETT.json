  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. RWS:JHB",
  "REVDATE": "04/2007",
  "STATES": "AL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sterrett series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy fluvial sediments deposited from sandstone and shale residuum.  These\nsoils are on nearly level flood plains and low stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

Content of concretions less than 1/4 inch in diameter ranges from 0 to 15 percent by volume throughout.\nThe Ap or A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The A2 horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR\nor 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of yellow or brown.  The A horizon is silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from very\nstrongly acid to medium acid.\nSome pedons have a B1 horizon as much as 6 inches thick.  It has\nhue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.\nMottles are in shades of brown, yellow, or gray.  Texture and reaction is the same as the A horizon, or it is a loam.\nThe B21t horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and\nchroma of 3 through 6 with coatings of chroma 1 or 2 on ped exteriors; or has value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2.  The B2tg\nhorizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1\nor 2.  Mottles are in shades of yellow and brown.  The B2t horizon\nis silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Reaction is\nvery strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe B3 horizon, and C horizon where present, has the same hue,\nvalue, and chroma as the lower part of the B2tg horizon.  Texture\nis sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay\nloam.  Reaction is medium acid to mildly alkaline."
