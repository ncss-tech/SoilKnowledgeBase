  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Content of concretions less than 1/4 inch in diameter ranges from 0 to 15 percent by volume throughout.\nThe Ap or A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The A2 horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR\nor 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of yellow or brown.  The A horizon is silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from very\nstrongly acid to medium acid.\nSome pedons have a B1 horizon as much as 6 inches thick.  It has\nhue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.\nMottles are in shades of brown, yellow, or gray.  Texture and reaction is the same as the A horizon, or it is a loam.\nThe B21t horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and\nchroma of 3 through 6 with coatings of chroma 1 or 2 on ped exteriors; or has value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2.  The B2tg\nhorizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1\nor 2.  Mottles are in shades of yellow and brown.  The B2t horizon\nis silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Reaction is\nvery strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe B3 horizon, and C horizon where present, has the same hue,\nvalue, and chroma as the lower part of the B2tg horizon.  Texture\nis sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay\nloam.  Reaction is medium acid to mildly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The only known series in the same family is the Steens series.  Steens soils are more acid in the lower part of\nthe B horizon.  Series in similar families include the Cupco,\nDundee, Fork, McGehee, and Sylacauga.  Cupco, Dundee, McGehee, and Sylacauga soils have less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in\nthe control section.  In addition, Dundee, Fork, McGehee, and Sylacauga soils have mixed mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sterrett soils are on nearly level flood\nplains and low stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in loamy fluvial sediments weathered from sandstone and shale uplands.  The mean annual precipitation near\nthe type location is about 53 inches and the mean annual\ntemperature is about 60 degrees F."

Allen, Etowah, and Townley soils are on upland positions and have a redder argillic horizon.  Choccolocco and Quitman soils are on slightly higher positions on\nthe landscape with Choccolocco soils being better drained.\nQuitman soils have a browner argillic horizon."
