    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Penning series in the same family, and the Alazan, Kurth, Metcalf, Pooleville, Raino, Sawtown, and Timpson series in closely related families. Alazan and Kurth soils do not have a clayey discontinuity. Penning soils have a solum 40 to 60 inches thick over clay shale or mudstone. Metcalf and Pooleville soils have a fine-silty control section. Raino soils have a fine-loamy over clayey control section. Sawtown soils do not have aquic conditions within the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  Timpson soils do not have aquic conditions within a depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on nearly level mounded stream terraces of Pleistocene age. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. They typically are at elevations 25 to about 100 feet above the present flood plains. Sawlit soils are mainly on slightly concave intermound positions on the landscape in complex with well drained soils on convex mounds.  They also occur less extensively on positions at the head of drains and along small drainageways. They formed in loamy sediments that have been reworked by wind, over a clayey discontinuity. Mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 67 degrees F. The growing season is 235 to 250 days. Average annual precipitation is 40 to 46 inches. Elevation ranges from 190 to 440 feet above sea level. The Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 66 to 80."
