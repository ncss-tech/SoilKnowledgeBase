Dixaleta soils contain 40 to 80 percent channers throughout the control section, lack 2 to 5 mm granitic pebbles in the control section, and are moist in some part of the moisture control section for more than 20 days cumulative following the summer solstice. Lavabed soils have a paralithic contact depth of 4 to 10 inches. Shankba soils are 14 to 20 inches to paralithic contact and formed from fine grained sedimentary rock. Xyzoic soils have a MAST of 59 to 68 degrees F."
