  "OVERVIEW": "The Stockdrive series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in eolian material over lacustrine sediments.  Stockdrive soils are on low lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
