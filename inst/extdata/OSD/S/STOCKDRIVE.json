Organic matter is 1 to 2 percent.\nNatric horizon - 3 to 12 inches.  All SAR and EC ranges are estimates based on similar soils with similar vegetation in Chewaucan and Warner Valleys; (2Btkn1 and 2Btkn2 horizons).\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.
