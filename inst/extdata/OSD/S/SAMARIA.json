  "OVERVIEW": "The Samaria series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Samaria soils are on lake terraces and fan remnants.  Slopes are 4 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
