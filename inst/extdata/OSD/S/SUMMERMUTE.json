  "OVERVIEW": "The Summermute series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from limestone. Summermute soils are on fan remnants and fan skirts. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
