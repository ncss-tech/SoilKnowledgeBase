    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Summermute soils are on fan remnants and fan skirts. These soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from limestone. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,525 to 2,290 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
