Foxmount, Krackle, Middlehill, and Rockabin soils are moderately deep. Gaia and Timmercrek soils are intermittently moist in the upper part for 10 to 20 days cumulative due to convection storms between July and September. Jackmill, Klug, Steepshrub and Wareagle soils have cambic horizons.  Lag soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 2 to 4 degrees C."
