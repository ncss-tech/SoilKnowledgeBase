  "OVERVIEW": "The Sup series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium derived from granitic and andesitic rocks.   These soils are on concave mountain side slopes.  Slopes are l5 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
