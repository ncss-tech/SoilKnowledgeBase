The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F.  The thickness of the solum above the nonconforming 2C clay horizon is 12 to 36 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The solum is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It has 22 to 27 percent clay and 5 to 15 percent gravel.  It has 1 to 3 percent organic matter.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or gravelly clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 10 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  A stone line is at the base of the solum in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is clay or silty clay with 55 to 70 percent clay.  The increase in clay from the Bt horizon is more than 25 percent.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid."
