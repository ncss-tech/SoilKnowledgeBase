  "OVERVIEW": "The Southwells series consists of very deep, well drained, soils that formed in sandy and loamy drift on disintegration moraines, end moraines, and kames. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
