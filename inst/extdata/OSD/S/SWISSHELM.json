  "OVERVIEW": "The Swisshelm series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed and stratified alluvium from volcanic, granitic and sedimentary rock.  Swisshelm soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.",
