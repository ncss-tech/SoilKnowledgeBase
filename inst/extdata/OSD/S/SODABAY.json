  "OVERVIEW": "The Sodabay series consists of deep well drained soils formed in material weathered from volcanic ash, dacite and pyroclastic tuff and breccia.  Sodabay soils are on hills, and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is 58 degrees F.",

The soil between depths of 6 and 16 inches is moist in all parts from December through March and is dry in all parts from July through October 15.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Coarse and very coarse sand varies from 5 to 15 percent throughout.  Base saturation varies from 75 to 95 percent throughout.  The clay percentage decreases at 50 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon is 5YR 6/3, 6/4 or 7.5YR 6/4.  Moist color is 5YR 3/3, 3/4 or 7.5YR 3/4.  Clay content is 10 to 20 percent.  Gravel content is 5 to 15 percent.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 2 percent.\nThe Bt horizon is 5YR 6/3, 6/4, 6/6 or 6/8.  Moist color is 5YR 3/3, 3/4, or 7.5YR 3/4.  The upper part of the Bt horizon is loam or clay loam with 5 to 15 percent pebbles.  It is 25 to 30 percent clay.  The lower part is clay loam and is 30 to 40 percent clay.  Gravel content commonly is 5 to 15 percent.\nThe BCt horizon is loam or clay loam and is 20 to 35 percent clay.  Gravel content commonly is 15 to 25 percent."

All these soils except Honn soils lack amorphous properties.  Academy, Cajalco, Coarsegold, Sobrante, and Trimmer soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Burchell soils have a moderately or strongly alkaline argillic horizon.  Honn soils have umbric epipedons, 10YR or 7.5YR hues in B2t horizon, and a solum thickness of 20 to 40 inches. Jacinto, Perkins, Pleasanton and Whitney soils have 10YR hues in the argillic and 10YR hues in the surface horizon.  Modesto soils have 10 to 15 percent absolute difference in clay within 3 inches from the A horizon to the B2t horizon, have more than 25 percent medium coarse and very coarse sand, and are somewhat poorly drained.  Olashes soils have Bt horizon with hues of 10YR or 7.5YR."
