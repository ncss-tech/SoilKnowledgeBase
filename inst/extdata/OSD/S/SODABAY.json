    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum varies from 40 to 80 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 59 to 63 degrees F.  The soil between depths of 6 and 16 inches is moist in all parts from December through March and is dry in all parts from July through October 15.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Coarse and very coarse sand varies from 5 to 15 percent throughout.  Base saturation varies from 75 to 95 percent throughout.  The clay percentage decreases at 50 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon is 5YR 6/3, 6/4 or 7.5YR 6/4.  Moist color is 5YR 3/3, 3/4 or 7.5YR 3/4.  Clay content is 10 to 20 percent.  Gravel content is 5 to 15 percent.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 2 percent.\nThe Bt horizon is 5YR 6/3, 6/4, 6/6 or 6/8.  Moist color is 5YR 3/3, 3/4, or 7.5YR 3/4.  The upper part of the Bt horizon is loam or clay loam with 5 to 15 percent pebbles.  It is 25 to 30 percent clay.  The lower part is clay loam and is 30 to 40 percent clay.  Gravel content commonly is 5 to 15 percent.\nThe BCt horizon is loam or clay loam and is 20 to 35 percent clay.  Gravel content commonly is 15 to 25 percent."

All these soils except Honn soils lack amorphous properties.  Academy, Cajalco, Coarsegold, Sobrante, and Trimmer soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Burchell soils have a moderately or strongly alkaline argillic horizon.  Honn soils have umbric epipedons, 10YR or 7.5YR hues in B2t horizon, and a solum thickness of 20 to 40 inches. Jacinto, Perkins, Pleasanton and Whitney soils have 10YR hues in the argillic and 10YR hues in the surface horizon.  Modesto soils have 10 to 15 percent absolute difference in clay within 3 inches from the A horizon to the B2t horizon, have more than 25 percent medium coarse and very coarse sand, and are somewhat poorly drained.  Olashes soils have Bt horizon with hues of 10YR or 7.5YR."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Sodabay soils occur on volcanic hills.  Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.  Elevations vary from 1,350 to 2,200 feet.  The soils are formed in amorphous materials derived primarily from volcanic ash, dacite and pyroclastic tuff and breccia.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 45 inches.  Mean January temperature is 42 degrees F; mean July temperature is 68 degrees F, mean annual air temperature is 55 to 59 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 150 to 200 days."
