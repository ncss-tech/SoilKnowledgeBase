  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Squishy soils are on outwash terraces and plains.  They typically occur on shoulder and concave positions.  They formed in alluvium from glacial outwash materials derived from mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks.   Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 1,955 to 2,015 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 350 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table at the surface (very shallow free water occurrence classes), throughout most years. Cumulative annual duration class is Persistent.  Frequent ponding at a depth of 3 to 10 cm is present for very long duration during most years. These soils are susceptible to flooding for brief periods from December to September."
