  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Squishy series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from glacial outwash materials derived from mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks.  Squishy soils are on outwash terraces and plains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

They formed in alluvium from glacial outwash materials derived from mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks.   Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 1,955 to 2,015 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 350 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
