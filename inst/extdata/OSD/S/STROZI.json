    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Strozi soils are on fan piedmont remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium primarily from igneous rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 2,300 to 4,500 feet.  The climate is arid with cool winters and summers are hot and dry, typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is between 6 and 9 inches; mean annual temperature is between 58 to 62 degrees F., and the frost-free season is about 210 days."
