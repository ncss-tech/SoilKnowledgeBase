  "OVERVIEW": "The Steimer series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Steimer soils are on floodplain steps.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C.",
