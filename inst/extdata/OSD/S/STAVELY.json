  "OVERVIEW": "The Stavely series consists of very deep, well-drained soils on forested mountain slopes. They formed in material weathered from intermediate intrusive rocks. Permeability is moderately rapid.\nSlopes are 10 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Selon soils have an E/Bw horizon and a particle-size control section dominated with subrounded rock fragments of alluvial origin.  Snowshoe soils lack rock fragments in the series control section and have loam or fine sandy loam textures in the upper 25 to 30 inches with the particle-size control sedtion averaging a fine sandy loam texture."
