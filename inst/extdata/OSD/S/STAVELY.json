Selon soils have an E/Bw horizon and a particle-size control section dominated with subrounded rock fragments of alluvial origin.  Snowshoe soils lack rock fragments in the series control section and have loam or fine sandy loam textures in the upper 25 to 30 inches with the particle-size control sedtion averaging a fine sandy loam texture."

The soils formed in material weathered from intermediate intrusive igneous rocks. The average annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches. The average annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F."
