  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid throughout the solum except for the surface layer in areas where lime has been added.  Content of fine or very fine flakes of mica ranges from few to many throughout the solum.  Thin transition horizons with color and texture similar to adjacent horizons are present in some pedons.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam in areas that have not been eroded and is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam in eroded areas.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is commonly clay or sandy clay but some pedons have a thin layer of clay loam or sandy clay loam in the upper part.  Redox depletions with chroma 2 or less are within 30 inches of the surface.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has colors similar to those of the upper part or it does not have a dominant matrix color and is multicolored in shades of red, brown, and gray.  Texture of the lower part is clay, sandy clay, or silty clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon, present in most pedons, does not have a dominant matrix color and is multicolored in shades of brown, yellow, gray, and red.  Texture is clay, sandy clay, or silty clay.  The 2Bt horizon has coarse or very coarse blocky structure.\nThe C horizon, present in some pedons, generally does not have a dominant matrix color and is multicolored in shades of brown, gray, and red.  Texture is clay, silty clay, sandy clay, or clay loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in clayey marine sediments.  The climate is warm and humid.  Average annual temperature ranges from 63 to 67 degrees F. and average annual precipitation ranges from 53 to 60 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brantley, Freest, Demopolis, Oktibbeha, Sumter, and Watsonia soils.  The Brantley soils are on narrower ridges and steeper side slopes than the Searcy soils and have a decrease in clay content within 60 inches of the surface. The Freest soils are on terraces at lower elevations and are fine-loamy. The Demopolis and Watsonia soils generally are on lower, more dissected positions and are shallow to soft bedrock.  Sumter soils are also on lower positions and are moderately deep to soft bedrock.  Oktibbeha soils are on slightly lower positions and have vertic properties."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are in woodland and are used for timber production and wildlife habitat.  Common trees include loblolly pine, shortleaf pine, sweetgum, white oak, hickory, and red oak.  Some areas have been cleared for use as cropland, pastureland, and hayland.  Common crops include soybeans, corn, cotton, and wheat."
