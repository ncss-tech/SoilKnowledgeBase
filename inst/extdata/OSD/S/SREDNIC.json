    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is dry for one-half to three-fourths of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  The mollic colors in the Bw horizon are from the parent material.  The depth to hard bedrock is 25 to 50 inches.  The thickness of the solum and depth to an indurated duripan is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to carbonates is 12 to 20 inches.  The particle size control section averages 15 to 35 percent rock fragments mainly as gravel sized cinders and 5 to 18 percent clay.  It contains 40 to 85 percent volcanic glass in the 0.02 to 0.25 mm size fraction.  Phosphate retention is 15 to 25 percent.  The acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.5 to 1.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has values of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist; and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has 1 to 3 percent organic matter.  It has 35 to 50 percent gravel size cinders.\nThe upper part of the Bw has values of 4 or 5 dry.  It is gravelly sandy loam, gravelly loam, and very gravelly sandy loam.  Rock fragment content is 15 to 40 percent.  Clay content is 5 to 18 percent.  It has 0.5 to 1 percent organic matter.\nThe lower part of the Bw horizon has values of 5 or 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chromas of 2 through 4.  It is gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loam.   Rock fragment content is 15 to 35 percent by volume.  Clay content is 5 to 18 percent. Reaction is mildly to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bkqm horizon has values dry of 7 or 8 dry, 6 or 7 moist, and chromas of 1 through 4."
