  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to more than 60 inches.  The soil is strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the profile.  Some pedons have a lithologic discontinuity or a buried horizon at depths of 40 inches or more that commonly is separated from the overlying horizon by a stone line.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 7 percent in the A and B horizons and to as much as 35 percent in the C or 2C horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is clay loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, or loam.\nThe 2C horizon or, where present, the C horizon has hue in shades of red to brown or it is mottled in these colors.  It is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, in the fine-earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Riverview series is the only other known series in this family.  Riverview soils have a browner or yellower hue.  Cartecay, Chewacla, Congaree, Ochlockonee, and Toccoa series are similar soils in other families.  Cartecay and Chewacla soils have wetness mottles of chroma 2 or less.  Congaree soils do not have a cambic horizon.  Ochlockonee and Toccoa soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Starr soils are in slight depressions, around drain heads, on terraces and on foot slopes or fans.  The soils receive runoff from adjacent higher slopes.  Slopes are commonly 0 to 8 percent.  Most areas are 1 to 20 acres  in size.  The soil formed in recent local alluvium eroded mostly from upland residual Piedmont soils.  Average annual precipitation is about 50 inches, average annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F. and the freeze-free season is 200 to 240 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils are presently Fluventic Dystrochrepts.  The landform position where these soils have been correlated has been dominantly foot slopes and upland depressions.  The material washed from surrounding uplands has the clay increase that qualifies as an argillic horizon.  The original type location from Pickens County, South Carolina was described in 1963 as having clay films in the B horizon."
