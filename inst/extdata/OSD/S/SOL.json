  "OVERVIEW": "The Sol series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy glacial till on moraines.  They are on glaciated ground moraines and end moraines.  The permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 1 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free carbonates ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  These soils typically have 2 to 15 percent pebble size rock fragments throughout and 0 to 35 percent cobbles.  The cobbles are typically concentrated in the upper third of the series control section.   A cobbly phase is recognized.  The soil moisture control section is not dry for in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 to 3  The fine earth fraction is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  The reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR,  value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  The fine earth fraction is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  The reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe B/E or E/B has properties similar to the E and Bt horizon respectively.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  The fine earth fraction is loam or sandy clay loam with subhorizons of sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  The clay content ranges from 18 to 27 percent and the sand content ranges from 45 to 65 percent.  The reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon that is similar to the C horizon but have appreciable evidence of secondary carbonate accumulation.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 or 6. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  The clay content ranges from 8 to 18 percent and the sand content ranges from 45 to 70 percent.  The reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It has 10 to 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

Bamfield, Duluth and Warba soils have more than 18 percent clay in the lower third of the series control section.  Cushing soils have less than 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the C horizon. (Cushing soils will need redifinition upon an MLRA-90 correlation).  Lozeau soils have a paralithic contact above a depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sol soils are on convex and linear slopes with gradients of 1 to 50 percent.  They formed in calcareous, loamy glacial till on ground moraines and end moraines in material of the Wisconsinan Age.  This soil is associated with the Itasca Moraine in north central Minnesota.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 28 inches. Mean air annual temperature ranges from 37 to 43 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 90 to 130 days.  The elevation above sea level ranges from 1200 to 1650 feet."
