  "OVERVIEW": "The Sheafman series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in coarse gravelly outwash or colluvium derived from igneous rock. These soils are on outwash fans and escarpments. Slopes are 1 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 368 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.",
