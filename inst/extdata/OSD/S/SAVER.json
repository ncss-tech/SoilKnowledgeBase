  "OVERVIEW": "The Saver series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium. These soils are on alluvial fans and fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 191 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
