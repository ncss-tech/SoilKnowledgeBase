  "OVERVIEW": "The Sperry series consists of very deep, very poorly drained and poorly drained soils formed in loess. These soils are in slight depressions on broad upland divides and on treads of loess covered stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 900 millimeters.",
