  "OVERVIEW": "The Susquehanna series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, soils that formed in marine or stream deposits of silty clay and clay.  Permeability is very slow.  These nearly level to steep soils are on erosional uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain. Slopes range from 1 to 17 percent.",

Base saturation ranges from 35 to 60 percent at 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon.  The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout, except for the surface layer in areas that have been limed.  Calcium content does not drop below 2.5 me. per 100 grams of soil within 50 inches of the soil surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam, and severely eroded pedons can have clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10R, 2.5YR, or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8, or it has hue of 7.5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Few to many mottles with chroma of 2 or less are in the upper 10 inches of the Bt horizon, or the upper part is mottled in shades of gray, red, brown, or yellow.  The lower part of the Bt horizon and the 2Bt horizon have a gray matrix or they are mottled in shades of gray, red, brown, or yellow or it is mottled in these colors.  The Bt and 2Bt horizons are silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  The particle-size control section, upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon, has 35 to 60 percent clay.  It has COLE OF 0.09 or more."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Annona, Bryarly, and Woodville series in the same family and the closely related Angie, Boswell, Iredell, Kipling, Oktibbeha, Shubuta, White Store, and Wilcox\nseries.  Annona and Woodville soils range from medium acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part of the B horizon.  Bryarly soils are mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline and are calcareous in the lower part of the B horizon and have few to common soft masses of calcium carbonate.  Angie soils have a yellowish brown Bt horizon and have less than 35 percent base saturation.  Boswell soils do not have gray mottles in the upper 10 inches of the Bt horizon.  Irdell and Oktibbeha soils have a\nBt horizon less than 50 inches thick and do not have gray mottles in the upper 10 inches of the Bt horizon.  Kipling soils have a yellowish brown Bt horizon that is less than 50 inches thick.  Shubuta soils have mixed mineralogy and do not have mottles within the upper 30 inches of the solum.  White Store soils have less that 35 percent base saturation.  Wilcox soils have a Bt horizon that is less than 50 inches thick."

Moderately well drained Angie and Boswell soils, well drained Shubuta soils, and somewhat poorly drained Wilcox soils are in similar positions as the Susquehanna soils.  Well drained Cahaba soils and moderately well drained Izagora soils, which are on terraces, are in a fine-loamy family.  Well drained Cowarts, Ruston, and Wicksburg soils are on broader, smoother slopes.  In addition, Cowarts and Ruston soils are in a fine-loamy family and Wicksburg soils have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Well drained Lucy soils and somewhat excessively drained Rumford soils, which mainly are in slightly higher positions on hillslopes, are in a loamy, siliceous family."
