  "OVERVIEW": "The Sagecreek series consist of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy slope alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  These soils occur on alluvial fans and terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

(Btk and Bk horizons)\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 4 inches.  (A horizon)\nCambic horizon:  The zone from 4 to 16 inches.  (Btk horizon)\nOther features:  The presence of secondary calcium carbonate in the zone from 4 to 60 inches.  (Btk and Bk horizons)\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nA paper revision and update of the series was made by MO6 August 2000.  The classification was changed from Typic Camborthids to Typic Haplocambids.  Format and horizonation designations were updated.  The series has not been updated by the state since 1972."
