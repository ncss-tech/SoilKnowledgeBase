    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is affected by peaks periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer.  Typic aridic moisture regime.\nMean annual soil temperature:  about 46 degrees F\nMean summer soil temperature:  about 64 degrees F\nDepth to secondary calcium carbonate:  3 to 30 inches\nDepth to cambic horizon: 3 to 6 inches\nParticle-size control section (weighted average):\nClay content:  18 to 35 percent\nSand content:  20 to 55 percent with less than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand\nRock fragments:  0 to 35 percent gravel\nA horizon:\nHue:  7.5YR to 5Y\nValue:  5 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist\nChroma:  1 to 4 dry or moist\nCalcium carbonate equivalent:  4 to 14 percent\nGypsum:  0 to 3 percent\nESP:  0 to 15\nReaction:  slightly or moderately alkaline\nBtk horizon:\nHue:  7.5YR to 5Y\nValue:  5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist\nChroma:  1 to 6 dry or moist\nTexture:  loam or clay loam\nClay content:  18 to 35 percent\nCalcium carbonate equivalent:  4 to 14 percent\nGypsum:  0 to 5 percent\nESP:  0 to 15\nReaction:  moderately or strongly alkaline\nNoteIt is assumed that this horizon does not have the necessary clay increase to qualify as an argillic horizon.\nBk horizon:\nHue:  7.5YR to 5Y\nClay content:  18 to 35 percent\nCalcium carbonate equivalent:  4 to 14 percent\nGypsum:  0 to 5 percent\nESP:  0 to 15\nReaction:  moderately or strongly alkaline\nCOMPETING SERIES:  There are no current competitors in this family.  Similar and related series include the Kinnear and Unson series. The Kinnear soils are sandier and have soil temperature warmer than 47 degrees F.  the Unson series are sandier and have more than 35 percent coarse fragments.\nGEOGRAPHIC SETTING:\nParent material: loamy slope alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks\nLandform:  nearly level to sloping alluvial fans and terraces\nSlopes:  0 to 6 percent\nElevation: 6,800 to 7,200 feet\nMean annual temperature:  about 42 degrees F\nMean annual precipitation:  about 7 inches at the type location with peak precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer\nFrost-free period:  100 to 110 days.\nGEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Forelle and Unson series.  The Forelle series differ in having an argillic horizon.  The Unson series differ in containing more than 35 percent coarse fragments.\nDRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is medium to rapid. Permeability is moderate to rapid.\nUSE AND VEGETATION:  They are used as native pastureland or as irrigated hayland.  Native vegetation includes big sage, cactus, thickspike wheatgrass, shadscale.\nDISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Present known distribution limited to southern and western Wyoming.  Series is of moderate extent.\nMLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana\nSERIES PROPOSED:  Sage Creek area, Carbon County, Wyoming, 1972.  Series name is taken from the name of a stream.\nREMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Btk and Bk horizons)\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 4 inches.  (A horizon)\nCambic horizon:  The zone from 4 to 16 inches.  (Btk horizon)\nOther features:  The presence of secondary calcium carbonate in the zone from 4 to 60 inches.  (Btk and Bk horizons)\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nA paper revision and update of the series was made by MO6 August 2000.  The classification was changed from Typic Camborthids to Typic Haplocambids.  Format and horizonation designations were updated.  The series has not been updated by the state since 1972.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
