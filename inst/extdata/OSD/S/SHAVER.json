The higher portion of the elevation range is restricted to the southern Sierra Nevada, generally on south aspects. The soils formed in material weathered from granitic rocks. The climate is Mediterranean, with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual air temperature is 12 degrees C, with mean January air temperature of 1 degree C and mean July air temperature of 18 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is 750 to 1115 mm, of which 1 to 20 percent occurs as snow. The frost-free season is about 140 to 250 days."

Ahwahnee, Chaix, Chawanakee, Holland and Musick do not have umbric epipedons. All occur primarily on backslopes of high hills or mountains. The shallower soils without argillic horizons (Chawanakee and Chaix) occur on steeper, less stable portions of the backslope, or on shoulders or summits. Ahwahnee, Musick and Holland soils occur in more stable positions, with Musick tending to occur higher on the landscape. Musick soils have 2.5YR hue in the upper part of the argillic horizon."
