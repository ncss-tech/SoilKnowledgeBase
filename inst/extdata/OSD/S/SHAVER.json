  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 40 to 80 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 47 degrees to 59 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is between 65 degrees and 75 degrees F and the mean winter soil temperature is 30 degrees to 40 degrees F.  The soil between depths of about 10 and 30 inches is usually dry from mid-June to late October and moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  Texture is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam throughout the profile except in some pedons which contain loamy sand or loamy coarse sand grading to the paralithic contact.  Rock fragments, mostly 2 to 5 mm in size make up 0 to 15 percent of the soil profile.  The profile is slightly acid to medium acid and is generally less acid in the upper part.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/2, 4/2, 4/1 or 5/4 dry and 10YR 3/2, 3/3 moist. Organic carbon content ranges from about 4 percent in the upper part to about 0.7 in the lower part.  It remains above 0.7 at depths of 20 to 30 or more inches.  Base saturation ranges from about 30 to 60 percent but is always less than 50 percent within the upper 7 inches.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 5/4, 5/6, dry.  Moist colors are 1 to 2 units darker.  Base saturation generally ranges from about 5 to 50 percent."

The higher elevation is restricted to the southern Sierra mountain range, generally on south aspects.  The soils formed in material weathered from granitic rocks.\nThe climate is subhumid, with warm dry summers and cool moist and snowy winters.  Mean January temperature is 33 degrees F, mean July temperature is 65 degrees F and the mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 140 to 240 days."
