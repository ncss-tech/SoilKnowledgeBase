  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The control section ranges from 35 to 60 percent clay.  Typically, the soil does not have carbonates, but some pedons are calcareous below 20 inches.  Conductivity ranges from 10 to 50 mmhos/cm, with the highest conductivity is in the upper horizons. The salt content ranges from 1 to 2 percent above a depth of 30 inches. Some pedons have surface layers up to 19 inches thick consisting of recent stratified alluvium.  Clay shale typically is at a depth of 50 to 60 inches but ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value is 3 to 5, 5 or 6 dry; and chroma is 0 to 2.  It is typically silty clay loam, but some are silty clay and clay.  Some pedons have an overburden of stratified alluvium that is sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  A thin surface salt crust up to 1/2 inch thick is common on most pedons when dry.  It ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value is 4 to 7, 5 to 8 dry; and chroma is 0 to 3.  It is silty clay, silty clay loam, clay loam, or clay and some pedons have as much as 35 percent fragments of shale in the lower part.  Some pedons have thin layers that are less than 35 percent clay.  Some pedons have sand and gravel below depths of 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to strongly alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon typically is clay shale but is soft sandstone in some pedons.  It ranges from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sage soils are on bottom lands and fans.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent.  The soils formed in clayey alluvium overlying clay shale, soft sandstone or stratified alluvium.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 47 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 16 inches.  These soils have a seasonal high water table at the surface to a depth of about 2 feet."

Dogiecreek soils are on similar landscapes and have a coarse loamy control section.  Absher, Gerdrum, and Hisle soils have a natric horizon and are on slightly higher parts of the landscape.  Harlem, Kyle, Lismas, Pierre, Swanboy, Wasa, Winler, and Twotop soils do not have the high percent of salt.  Harlem soils are on slightly higher bottom lands and Kyle, Swanboy, and Twotop soils are on the higher parts of upland fans. Lismas soils are shallow to clay shale and are on convex ridgetops. Pierre, Wasa, and Winler soils are moderately deep to clay shale and are on side slopes above and adjacent to the Sage soils."
