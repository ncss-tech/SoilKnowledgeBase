Fishsnooze and Sonorapass soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Florand soils have depth to base of the cambic horizon of 89 to 114 centimeters and do not have horizons in the particle-size control section that are dominated by cobbles.  Forsell and Sumeadow soils are very deep.  Lostridge soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts."
