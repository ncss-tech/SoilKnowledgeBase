  "OVERVIEW": "The Sibelia series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived mainly from andesite.  Sibelia soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1143 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
