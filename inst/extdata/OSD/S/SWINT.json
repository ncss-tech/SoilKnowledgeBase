  "OVERVIEW": "The Swint series consists of very deep, well drained and moderately well drained soils formed in reddish colored loamy alluvium on floodplains, terraces, and alluvial fans. These soils have moderate permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The control section includes silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam; and averages 18 to 24 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches thick.  Buried horizons are in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam and neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have an AC horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam and commonly is stratified with thin layers of coarser materials.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Sand or sand and gravel is between a depth of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons."
