    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Typically this soil has free carbonate at the surface but some pedons are leached to a depth of 8 inches.  The control section includes silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam; and averages 18 to 24 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches thick.  Buried horizons are in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam and neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have an AC horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam and commonly is stratified with thin layers of coarser materials.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Sand or sand and gravel is between a depth of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons."
