    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F.  The solum is\n4 to 10 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. The textural control section has 10 to 18 percent clay.  The surface has 0 to 10 percent cobbles and stones.  The rock fragments throughout the profile are channers and flagstones.  Some pedons have a 1 to 2 inch thick Cr layer above the bedrock.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 30 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It has 30 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  The fine earth texture is loam, silt loam, or sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 to 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It has 35 to 60 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  The fine earth texture is loam, silt loam, or sandy loam."
