  "OVERVIEW": "The Saralegui series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Saralegui soils are on lake terraces, stream terraces and alluvial fans. Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
