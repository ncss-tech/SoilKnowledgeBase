The soils formed in residuum and colluvium from porphoritic andesite, volcanic breccia and lahar material of similar mineralogy, together with an admixture of volcanic ash and pumice.  Average annual temperature is 39 to 43 degrees F, the growing season (28 degrees F) is 140 to 160 days, the average annual precipitation ranges from 80 to 100 inches."
