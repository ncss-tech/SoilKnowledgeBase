  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact of shale is 24 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 60 degrees to 65 degrees F., and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F.  at any time.  Soil between the depths of about 4 to 12 inches usually is dry all of the time from sometime in April or May until November or early December and usually is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.  Textures throughout are silt loam or silty clay loam with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser and usually the clay content is about 27 to 35 percent.  After the surface few inches have been disturbed the soils are weakly to violently effervescent and the amount of lime increases somewhat with depth.\nThe A horizon is gray to light gray in 10YR or 5Y hue and chroma is less than 2.  It has about 1 to 5 percent organic matter but the moist value is 4 or more in some or all parts.\nThe C horizon is variable but usually has one unit higher value or stronger chroma than the A horizon.  It is light gray to white, 7/2, 8/2, 8/1 in 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y hue."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Docas soils are stratified and lack a paralithic contact.  Kettleman soils have a Torric moisture regime.  Linne and Nacimiento soils have a mollic epipedon and dry value of 5 or less and moist value of 3 or 2."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shedd soils are moderately sloping to very steep and are on hills at elevations of 200 to 2,500 feet.  The soils formed in residuum weathered from calcareous soft shale.  The climate is semiarid to dry subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 20 inches.  Average January temperature is about 46 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 74 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 58 degrees to 60 degrees F.  The freeze-free season is about 250 days."

Diablo are clay soils with slickensides.  Gazos and San Benito soils have mollic epipedons that are not calcareous in some or all parts.  Newville soils have brown argillic horizons."
