  "OVERVIEW": "The Springbar series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived mainly from welded tuff. Springbar soils are on spits and longshore bars of relict lake shores. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
