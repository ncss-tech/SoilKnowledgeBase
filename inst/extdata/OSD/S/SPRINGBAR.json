    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Springbar soils are on spits and longshore bars of relict lake shores. These soils formed from mixed alluvium derived mainly from welded tuff. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 1,590 to 1,770 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
