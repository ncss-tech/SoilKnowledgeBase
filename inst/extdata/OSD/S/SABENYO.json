  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 70 inches. An estimated 1/4 to 1/2 of the clay fraction is carbonates. The 10- to 40-inch particle size control section ranges from loam to clay loam, averaging 18 to 30 percent silicate clay. The control section ranges from 40 to 80 percent by weight of calcium carbonate equivalent with 15 to 34 percent in the form of cemented concretions.\nThe Ap and A horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loam or clay loam. It contains 30 to 70 percent by weight of calcium carbonate equivalent.\nThe Bk and Ck horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 6. The Bk horizon is loam or clay loam and the BCk horizon is loam, sandy loam, or clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Similar soils are the Atco, Colibro, Conalb, McAllen, and Saspamco series. Atco and Saspamco soils are in the coarse-loamy family. Colibro soils are moist for longer periods. Conalb soils have an irregular distribution of organic matter due to stratification. McAllen soils, as well as Colibro and Saspamco soils, have less than 40 percent calcium carbonate in their control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sabenyo soils are on stream terraces and footslopes in narrow valleys. They mainly occur on beveled slopes between broad level old terraces and lower terraces or flood plains. Slope gradients are 1 to 5 percent. The soil formed in loamy sediments derived from soils formed from limestone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 20 to 30 inches, mean annual temperature from 70 degrees to 72 degrees F., and mean annual Thornthwaite P-E indices from about 26 to 38."
