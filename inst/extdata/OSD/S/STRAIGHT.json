The soils are usually moist but\nare dry in the control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days\nduring the summer and early fall.  Depth to a paralithic contact\nand solum thickness is 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments in the control section range from 35 to 75 percent, ranging from 25 to\n50 percent gravel, 10 to 25 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.  Hue is 5YR or 2.5YR.  The solum ranges from loam to clay loam and averages 10 to 27 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  This horizon\nhas moderate fine to medium granular or very fine subangular\nblocky structure.  It has 10 to 30 percent cobbles and 25 to 75 percent gravel.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR moist, 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR\ndry, value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and\ndry.  It is loam or clay loam with 35 to 75 percent rock\nfragments and 18 to 30 percent clay.  It has weak or moderate granular and subangular blocky structure.  In some pedons most of\nthe rock fragments are partially weathered.  It is very gravelly\nloam or clay loam or very cobbly clay loam."
