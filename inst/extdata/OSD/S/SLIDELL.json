  "OVERVIEW": "The Slidell series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, clayey sediments.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on base slopes of ridges on hills.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 in).  Mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).",
