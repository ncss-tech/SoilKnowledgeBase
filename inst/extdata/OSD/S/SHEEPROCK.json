  "OVERVIEW": "The Sheeprock series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that were formed in deep alluvial coarse sand and fine gravel.  These soils are on rolling hills and scarp faces or terraces.  Slopes range from 10 to 30 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 47 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches.",

Alderdale have a lithic contact within 20 to 40 inches. Burbank soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 52 to 56 degrees and are non calcareous in the upper part. Denio and Doowak soils have soil temperature of 50 to 52 degrees. In addition, Denio soils are non-effervescent and Doowak soils are non-effervescent in the top 20 inches. Crunkvar, Skaha, and Ulymeyer soils are non-effervescent throughout. Wrango soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 53 to 59 degrees F."

They formed in deep alluvial coarse sand and fine gravel from granitic and acid igneous parent material.  The climate is dry subhumid.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 to 48 degrees F., mean summer temperature is about 64 to 66 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches.  Average frost-free period is 100 to 110 days."

Ushar soils have B horizons with more than 18 percent clay, lack coarse fragments, and have calcic horizons.  Cokel soils have sandy loam over very gravelly sand or sand in the control section and have calcic horizons."
