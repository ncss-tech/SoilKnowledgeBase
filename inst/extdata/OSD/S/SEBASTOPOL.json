Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nDiagnostic horizons and features are as follows:\n1.  Ochric epipedon - 0 to 8 inches (Ap1, Ap2); ranges from 7 to 12 inches thick.  Clay content by field estimates is 20 percent.\n2.  Argillilc horizon - 12 to 62 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4); ranges from 37 to 62 inches thick.  B.S.  is assumed to be less than 35 percent.  The textural control section is 12 to 32 inches or the top 20 inches of the argillic horizon.  Clay content by field estimates of the textural control section is 35 to 50 percent.\n3.  The soil temperature is 56 F to 58 degrees F - assumed from similar soils.\n4.  Soil moisture regime--the moisture control section (6 to 18 inches) is dry in all parts from June 15th through October 15th.  It is moist in all parts from December 15th through April and assumed to be moist in some part more than 90 consecutive days when the soil temperature is greater than 46 degrees F.\nThe soil temperature is always above 41 degrees F.\nMonth:           J F M A M  J  J A S O  N  D\nMoisture         M M M M MD MD D D D MD MD M\nM   = Moist all parts\nMD  = Moist some parts\nD   = Dry all parts\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
