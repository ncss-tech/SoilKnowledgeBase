It is strongly acid or medium acid.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 2 to 4. Faces of prisms have chroma of 2 or less. The Bg horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam. Clay films in all or part of the horizon are very few to many and are more than 1 mm thick. The Btx horizon is medium acid to neutral in the upper part and neutral in the lower part.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon that has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 1 to 4, and is mottled. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is silt loam or silty clay loam.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Brinkerton, Calvert, Croton, Doylestown, Ginat, Robertsville, and Thorndale series in the same family and the Frenchtown, Sebring, Trumbull, and Venango series. Brinkertown soils are strongly acid or medium acid in the lower part of the solum, and do not have free carbonates in the C horizon. Calvert, Croton, and Doylestown soils all lack carbonates in the C horizon and all have shale or rock within a few inches of the lower boundary of the fragipan. In addition, Calvert soils have a small content of mica and serpentine fragments. Ginat and Robertsville soils typically have thicker sola and have reaction lower than medium acid in Btx horizons. Thorndale soils have slightly acid or medium acid C horizons of material weathered from bedrock and have part of the argillic horizon above the fragipan rather than in the fragipan. Frenchtown and Venango soils are in the fine-loamy family. In addition, Venango soils have more than 40 percent of the mass of some horizons above the fragipan with chromas of 3 or more. Sebring soils lack a fragipan. Trumbull soils are in the fine family and lack a fragipan."

The moderately well drained Pierpont soils and somewhat poorly drained Platea soils are in a toposequence with Sheffield soils. Pierpont soils are on more sloping or higher landscape positions. Platea soils are on slightly higher landscape positions."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: An estimated CEC activity class was added at the NSSC request. No further work was done in 2/2006. Sheffield was not recorrelated in the update of Ashtabula County, OH in 2001. This OSD is an orphan since Sheffield was not recorrelated in the update of Ashtabula County, OH. Sheffield remains an active series since it is used in 3 other counties in OH and PA. The last true update of the series was 1/86.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nochric epipedon - from the surface to a depth of about 8 inches (Ap horizon); albic horizon from a depth of about 8 to 18 inches (Eg horizon);\nargillic horizon - from a depth of about 22 to 41 inches (Btx1, Btx2 horizons); fragipan from a depth of about 22 to 41 inches (Btx1, Btx2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available for 6 pedons in Ashtabula County: AB-53, AB-S10, AB-37 (typical pedon), AB-52, AB-75, and AB-97.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
