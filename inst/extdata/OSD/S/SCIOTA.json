All of these soils are from outside of Region R.  Aylmer, Poppleton and Redby soils are in areas of lower precipitation and are substantially drier in the soil moisture control section during the growing season.  Clearriver soils have B/E horizons.  Hiwood and Lino soils are more acid in the control section.  Meehan soils have more than 50 percent medium sand and coarser in the series control section.  Rushlake soils have free carbonates above 40 inches.  Winterfield soils have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with increasing depth."

Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 36 inches; mean annual air temperature ranges 42 to 46 degrees F; and the mean frost-free season ranges from 120 to 150 days.

Wainola, Junius, Flackville, Pinconning and Coveytown soils are also associated.  Wainola soils are on similar landscapes but have spodic development.  The poorly and somewhat poorly drained Junius soils are on similar landscapes in mesic areas. Flackville and Pinconning soils are on similar landscapes but have clayey substrata within a 20 to 40 inch depth.  Coveytown soils occur near the toe of glacial lake beach ridges where sands are underlain by loamy deposits."
