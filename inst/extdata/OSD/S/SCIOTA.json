Redoximorphic features consisting of concentrations of Fe/Mn accumulation, and Fe depletions occur within 40 inches of the mineral soil surface.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Rock fragments are typically absent, but may range up to 2 percent by volume in the lower subsoil and substratum. Unless limed, reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the surface layer, slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the subsoil, and neutral to moderately alkaline in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. It has faint to prominent redox concentrations and depletions.  Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is weak or very weak subangular blocky or is single grain.  Consistence is very friable or loose.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It has faint to prominent redox concentrations and/or depletions.  Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand in the fine earth fraction.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Aylmer, Clearriver, Hiwood, Lino, Meehan, Poppleton, Redby, Rushlake and Winterfield series in the same family.  All of these soils are from outside of Region R.  Aylmer, Poppleton and Redby soils are in areas of lower precipitation and are substantially drier in the soil moisture control section during the growing season.  Clearriver soils have B/E horizons.  Hiwood and Lino soils are more acid in the control section.  Meehan soils have more than 50 percent medium sand and coarser in the series control section.  Rushlake soils have free carbonates above 40 inches.  Winterfield soils have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with increasing depth."

Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 36 inches; mean annual air temperature ranges 42 to 46 degrees F; and the mean frost-free season ranges from 120 to 150 days.  Elevation ranges from 200 to 600 feet above sea level."

Wainola, Junius, Flackville, Pinconning and Coveytown soils are also associated.  Wainola soils are on similar landscapes but have spodic development.  The poorly and somewhat poorly drained Junius soils are on similar landscapes in mesic areas. Flackville and Pinconning soils are on similar landscapes but have clayey substrata within a 20 to 40 inch depth.  Coveytown soils occur near the toe of glacial lake beach ridges where sands are underlain by loamy deposits."
