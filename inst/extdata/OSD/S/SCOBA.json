  "OVERVIEW": "The Scoba series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils which are moderately deep to sandy outwash.  They formed mostly in loamy alluvium and in the underlying stratified sandy outwash on outwash plains, glacial drainageways, stream terraces, glacial lake basins, and outwash areas on moraines.  Permeability is moderate in the loamy mantle and rapid or very rapid in the sandy outwash.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual  precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the loamy mantle and depth to sandy outwash range from 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control averages 8 to 17 percent clay and 50 percent or more fine sand or coarser.  Volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the loamy mantle but is typically less than 15 percent. Volume of gravel ranges from 3 to 45 percent as a weighted average in the sandy outwash, but ranges from 0 to 60 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the loamy mantle and from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy outwash.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the substratum.  Redox accumulations are within a depth of 40 inches.  These are due to periods of near-saturation and reduction caused by restricted internal drainage associated with contrasting porosity at the sandy outwash contact.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. Value dry is 6 or more.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nScoba soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has colors and textures like the E horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 4 or 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nThe 2C horizon has color like the 2Bt horizon above. It is typically stratified sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs but some pedons have thin subhorizons of loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs."

Closely related are the Anigon, Antigo, Brill, Halder, Oesterle, Sconsin, and Scott Lake series.  None of the competing soils have a zone of near-saturation with redox features within the soil.  In addition, Alban soils have stratified loamy and sandy lacustrine deposits within 40 inches.  Arland soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Amery, Kennan, and Marathon soils do not average more than 85 percent sand in the fine-earth fraction within a depth of 40 inches. Langlade soils are 40 to 60 inches thick to sandy outwash with more than 85 percent sand in the fine earth fraction.  Anigon and Brill soils are fine-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal and Anigon soils do not have redox features.  Antigo and Sconsin soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and Antigo soils do not have redox features. Halder and Oesterle soils have saturation and redox depletions in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon and Halder soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal."
