  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the loamy mantle and depth to sandy outwash range from 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control averages 8 to 17 percent clay and 50 percent or more fine sand or coarser.  Volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the loamy mantle but is typically less than 15 percent. Volume of gravel ranges from 3 to 45 percent as a weighted average in the sandy outwash, but ranges from 0 to 60 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the loamy mantle and from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy outwash.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the substratum.  Redox accumulations are within a depth of 40 inches.  These are due to periods of near-saturation and reduction caused by restricted internal drainage associated with contrasting porosity at the sandy outwash contact.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. Value dry is 6 or more.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nScoba soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has colors and textures like the E horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 4 or 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nThe 2C horizon has color like the 2Bt horizon above. It is typically stratified sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs but some pedons have thin subhorizons of loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alban, Amery, Arland, Kennan, Langlade, Marathon, Mcginn, Rosholt, and Santiago series.  Closely related are the Anigon, Antigo, Brill, Halder, Oesterle, Sconsin, and Scott Lake series.  None of the competing soils have a zone of near-saturation with redox features within the soil.  In addition, Alban soils have stratified loamy and sandy lacustrine deposits within 40 inches.  Arland soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Amery, Kennan, and Marathon soils do not average more than 85 percent sand in the fine-earth fraction within a depth of 40 inches. Langlade soils are 40 to 60 inches thick to sandy outwash with more than 85 percent sand in the fine earth fraction.  Anigon and Brill soils are fine-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal and Anigon soils do not have redox features.  Antigo and Sconsin soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and Antigo soils do not have redox features. Halder and Oesterle soils have saturation and redox depletions in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon and Halder soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Scoba soils are on outwash plains, glacial drainageways, stream terraces, glacial lake basins, and outwash areas on moraines.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. These soils formed mostly in loamy alluvium 20 to 40 inches thick and in the underlying stratified sandy outwash.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 120 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 800 to 1950 feet."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Minocqua, Oesterle and Rosholt soils.  The well drained Rosholt soils are in landscape positions similar to those of Scoba soils where there is no zone of near-saturation. The somewhat poorly drained Oesterle soils, and the poorly drained Minocqua soils form a drainage sequence in lower landscape positions where there is an apparent seasonal high water table."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Surface runoff is slow or moderate.  Permeability is moderate in the loamy mantle and rapid or very rapid in the sandy outwash.  These soils have redox features above the sandy outwash contact at a depth of 1.5 to 3.5 feet. It also has an apparent water table below 40 inches from March through June. The apparent water table within 40 inches has a duration of less than one month in normal years."
