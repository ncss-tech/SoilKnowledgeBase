    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sanwell soils are on relict alluvial flats and beach plains.  These soils formed in coarse lacustrine sediments, underlain by variable stratified sediments.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 2,300 to 2,700 feet.  The climate is arid, winters are cool and summers are hot and dry.  Distribution of precipitation is relatively even with slight peaks in January and August.  The average annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches; average annual temperature is 63 to 70 degrees F., and the frost-free season is about 210 days."
