  "OVERVIEW": "The Sanwell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in coarse lacustrine sediments.  Sanwell soils are on relict alluvial flats and beach plains. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.",
