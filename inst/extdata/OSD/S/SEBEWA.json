  "STATES": "IN,MI,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sebewa series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in loamy outwash and the underlying gravelly and sandy outwash on outwash plains, valley trains, and stream terraces on terrace landscapes. They are moderately deep to the gravelly and sandy outwash. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).",
