  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sebewa soils are on outwash plains, valley trains, and stream terraces on terrace landscapes. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Sebewa soils formed in loamy outwash and the underlying gravelly and sandy outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 11.1 degrees C (47 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation is 177 to 466 meters (580 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Boyer, Brady, Fox, Ionia, Kane, Matherton, and Oshtemo soils. The well drained Fox, the moderately well drained Ionia, and the somewhat poorly drained Matherton soils are in a drainage sequence with Sebewa soils in forested areas. The somewhat poorly drained Kane soils are also in a drainage sequence with Sebewa soils in areas of grassland. The well drained Boyer and Oshtemo soils and the somewhat poorly drained Brady soils are associated coarser-textured soils on outwash plains."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained or very poorly drained. Depth to a seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface from September to May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the loamy materials and high or very high in the underlying gravelly and sandy materials. Permeability is moderate in the loamy materials and rapid or very rapid in the underlying gravelly and sandy materials."
