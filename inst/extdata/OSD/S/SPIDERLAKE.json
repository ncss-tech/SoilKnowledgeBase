  "OVERVIEW": "The Spiderlake series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are moderately deep to stratified sandy outwash. These soils formed in silty and loamy alluvium or eolian deposits underlain by stratified sandy outwash.  They occur on outwash plains, outwash terraces, glacial lake plains, and in outwash areas within moraines. Permeability is moderate in the silty and loamy mantle and rapid or very rapid in the sandy outwash. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and depth to stratified sandy outwash ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 12 to 35 inches.  The silty mantle has more than 30 percent very fine sand. The sandy outwash has more than 85 percent sand. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 35 percent in the loamy subsoil.  Volume of gravel in the sandy outwash ranges from 3 to 45 percent as a weighted average, but ranges from 0 to 60 percent in individual strata. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon. Stones are on the surface in some areas and a stony phase is recognized. Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum, but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum. Redoximorphic accumulations are below the spodic horizon and within 40 inches. Saturation occurs within 40 inches for 1 month or more per year in most years.\nSome pedons have an O horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR,.value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. The O horizon is a mat of partially decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or 2. Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nSpiderlake soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizon or both). Horizonation has a wide range depending on the thickness of the silty mantle and the degree to which eluviation has occurred. Therefore, there can be E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons, singly or in combination, with or without Bt or 2Bt horizons.\nThe E part of the E/B or B/E horizons has colors and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a Bt horizon with colors and texture like the Bt part described above.  Spiderlake soils have less than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon.\nThe 2E part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizons has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs. The 2Bt part has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs. These horizons have more than 50 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe 2Bt horizon has colors and texture like the 2Bt part described above.  The combined thickness of the 2E/B, 2B/E, and 2Bt horizons is 5 inches or more.\nThe 3BC horizon (or 3Bt horizon when present) has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is stratified sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs."
