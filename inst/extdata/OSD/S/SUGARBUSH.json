  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free carbonates ranges from 15 to 40 inches.  The rock fragment content is less than 15 percent in the loamy mantle and ranges from 10 to 35 percent in the underlying sediments.  The rock fragments and sand grains are of 0 to 10 percent dark colored igneous and metamorphic in origin, 30 to 50 percent sedimentary, and the remainder light colored igneous.  The soil moisture control section is not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral. Some pedons have Ap horizons with value of 6 when dry and are loamy sand or loamy coarse sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or sand.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have thin BE horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.  It has 60 to 75 percent fine sand and coarser, 30 to 50 percent coarse sand and coarser.\nSome pedons have a 2B horizon.  Hue is 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma is 2 to 4.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, coarse sand or their gravelly analogues.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is sand, coarse sand or their gravelly analogues.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Balmlake soils have less than 60 percent by volume fine sand or coarser in the argillic horizon.  Bergkeller and Millward soils are moderately acid to neutral in the lower part of the series control section.  Bootlake soils have less than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.  Cunard soils have bedrock below the argillic horizon and within 40 inches.  Emmet, Flak, Heyder, Milaca, and Omena soils do not have sand and gravel below the argillic horizon and within 40 inches.  Nadeau soils have more than 35 percent gravel in the material below the argillic horizon.  Sanburn and Oconto soils do not have free carbonates within 40 inches."
