    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stinkcreek soils are on stream terraces and flood plains. They formed in mixed alluvium.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 4,400 to 5,100 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches, the mean annual air temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cachecan, Lewnot, and Windernot soils.  Cachecan soils are on stream terraces near Stinkcreek soils.  Cachecan soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a coarse-loamy particle-size class.  Lewnot soils are on terraces slightly above Stinkcreek soils.  Lewnot soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section and a seasonal high water table deeper than 24 inches.  Windernot soils are on high terraces above Stinkcreek soils.  Windernot soils are moderately well drained and have a sandy-skeletal particle-size class."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; very high surface runoff; moderately slow permeability (moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity) in the upper part and very rapid permeability (very high saturated hydraulic conductivity) in the lower part.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between the soil surface and 1.5 feet (very shallow and shallow free water occurrence classes) between February and June.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding between February and May."
