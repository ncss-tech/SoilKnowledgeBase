  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Stone soils are on footslopes on outwash terraces, outwash plains, and abandoned stream terraces of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in till or lacustrine material, poorly sorted outwash of high calcium carbonate content, and local drift occasionally mixed with the underlying residuum from limestone. Rock fragments are mainly limestone, crystalline, and shale. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 787 to 1067 mm (31 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F)."

The well drained Leoni soils are on adjacent kames and eskers. The well drained Scioto soils are on adjacent outwash terraces, kames, and eskers."

The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent water table ranges from 15 to 30 cm (0.5 to 1 foot) between December and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. The rarely flooded phase is subject to flooding from late fall to spring. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part and moderately high or high in the lower part. Permeability is moderately slow in the upper part and moderate or moderately rapid in the lower part."
