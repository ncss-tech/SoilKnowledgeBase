  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Sweek soils have cracks 5 mm or more that open and close once each year and remain open for 90 to 120 consecutive days (July through September).  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to weathered sediments of the John Day Formation is 40 to over 60 inches.  Depth to secondary carbonates is 20 to 30 inches.  The red hue found throughout the profile is derived from the red geologic member of the John Day Formation.  The particle-size control section averages 60 to 75 percent clay.  Soil reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline in the surface horizon and slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline in the subsoil.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 6 moist and dry.  It is silty clay with 40 to 55 percent clay.  It has 0 to 30 percent stones, 0 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe BA, Bss1, and Bss2 horizons have hues of 5YR, 2.5YR, or 10R, values of 3 or 4 moist and dry, and chromas of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  Soil structure is angular blocky or very coarse and coarse prismatic parting to angular blocky.  Slickensides are common or many and distinct or prominent.  It is clay with 60 to 75 percent clay.\nThe Bssk horizon has colors similar to the BA, Bss1, and Bss2 horizons.  Secondary carbonates occur as filaments or as soft masses.  Slickensides are few or common.  It is clay with 55 to 70 percent clay.  It has 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 0 to 15 percent gravel."

Agerdelly soils have carbonates at a depth of 30 to 44 inches and have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y.  Beirman soils have carbonates at a depth of 10 to 20 inches.  Day soils have open cracks for 120 to 150 consecutive days."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevations are 2,200 to 4,600 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 120 days."

Cupper soils are on fans and are in the ashy over loamy family.  Drybed soils have an aridic moisture regime, are fine-loamy, and occur at lower elevations.  Hack soils are on fans and are fine-loamy.  Haystack soils have an aridic moisture regime, are loamy-skeletal, and occur at lower elevations.  Patron soils vitrandic properties in the surface layers and are on north-facing slopes.  Wylie soils are shallow to a paralithic contact and are found on sideslopes near exposures of Badlands."
