  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 60 to 65 degrees F.  The soil between depths of about 5 and 15 inches usually is dry all of the time from late April or May until November or early December and is moist in some or part of the moisture control section all the rest of the year.  Rock fragments less than 3 inches in diameter make up about 1 to 15 percent of the soil profile.  Coarse and very coarse sand make up 12 to 22 percent of the profile.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown to dark brown (10YR 5/2, 4/2, 5/3, 4/3; 2.5Y 5/2). It is sandy loam or loam.  This horizon is massive in some or all of the parts or it has weak granular or subangular blocky structure in some or all parts.  This horizon has in all parts less than 1 percent organic matter.  It is neutral to medium acid.  The lower boundary is clear or gradual.\nThe Bt1 horizon is brown or dark brown (10YR 5/3, 4/3). In some pedons the lower part of this horizon is dark brown, brown, or light brown (7.5YR 4/4, 5/4 or 6/4). It is heavy loam or sandy clay loam and has 18 to 27 percent clay.  The absolute clay increase from the A horizon to the Bt2 horizon is 3 to 8 percent.  The Bt2 horizon has weak to moderate angular or subangular blocky structure.  It is neutral or slightly acid."

Arbuckle, Borden, Esparto, Fallbrook, Montpellier, Ramona, Snelling, Wasioja and Wyman soils lack a paralithic contact within a depth of 40 inches.  Blasingame soils have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR in all parts of the argillic horizon.  Bressa soils have less than 10 percent coarse and very coarse sand, and have 30 to 35 percent clay.  Comparison to Tivy soils explained in remarks."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in material weathered from granite, quartz diorite, gabbrodiorite and metamorphic basic volcanic rocks.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 25 inches.  The average January temperature is 48 to 53 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 75 to 79 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 59 to 65 degrees F.   The frost free season is 200 to 300 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Study shows that the Tivy soils of the Eastern Fresno Area, California, are essentially the same as the Sesame soils in soil properties.  Parent material of the Tivy soils were presumed to be higher in basic mineral rock source.  Tivy soils seem to have only a few percent fewer coarse and very coarse sand grains than average Sesame soils.  Possibly the Tivy soils could be correlated to the Sesame series.  The Tivy series will not be established unless better differentiae are developed.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
