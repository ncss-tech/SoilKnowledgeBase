Depth to visible secondary calcium carbonate is 15 to 36 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 68 to 72 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is sandy clay loam or loam.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 32 percent.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chrome of 3 to 6.  Texture is sandy clay loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.  Visible secondary calcium carbonate in the form of films and threads, masses and concretions of calcium carbonate comprise 2 to 10 percent by volume in the Btk and C horizons.\nThe BCk horizon, where present, is brownish, yellowish, or reddish fine sandy loam or loam.  In some pedons it is stratified and contains 0 to 15 percent by volume of siliceous and limestone pebbles."

All these soils except for Cuero soils have mean annual soil temperatures less than 67 degrees F.  In addition, Altus soils have grayish and brownish redoximorphic features in the lower argillic horizon.  Cuero soils have a mollic epipedon less than 26 inches thick.  Texroy soils are dry in the moisture control section for longer periods.  Tipton soils have less than 20 percent medium and coarse sand in the argillic horizon."

Slopes are mostly less than 1 percent, but range up to 2 percent.  The soil formed in calcareous, reddish, stratified loamy alluvium.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 42 inches.  Frost free days range from 260 to 290 days and elevation ranges from 150 to 500 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 44 to 70."
