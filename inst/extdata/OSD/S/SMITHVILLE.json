Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is sandy clay loam or loam.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 32 percent.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chrome of 3 to 6.  Texture is sandy clay loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.  Visible secondary calcium carbonate in the form of films and threads, masses and concretions of calcium carbonate comprise 2 to 10 percent by volume in the Btk and C horizons.\nThe BCk horizon, where present, is brownish, yellowish, or reddish fine sandy loam or loam.  In some pedons it is stratified and contains 0 to 15 percent by volume of siliceous and limestone pebbles."
