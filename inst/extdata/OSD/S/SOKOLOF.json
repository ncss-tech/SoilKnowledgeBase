  "OVERVIEW": "The Sokolof series consists of very deep, well drained organic soils formed in extremely gravelly beach deposits.  Sokolof soils are on uplifted beach terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 100 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the upper horizons (Oe and Oa1 horizons), which are comprised primarily of decomposing forest litter.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 70 to 90 percent in the lower horizons where the organic material fills or partially fills the interstices between rock fragments.  Rock fragments are primarily gravel size with some cobble.  The soil does not freeze in most years due to maritime influence. Reaction is less than 4.5 (0.01M CaCl2) throughout the control section.\nThe organic material has hue ranging from 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma from 0 to 2. Thin mineral horizons, up to 1 inch thick, are present in the control section of some pedons."

Elevation ranges from sea level to 100 feet."

Laboratory data for another pedon of the Sokolof series is available at the National Soil Survey Lab.\nThe Sokolof series includes the concept of the tentative Tebenkof series.  Tebenkof series should be dropped."
