  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the upper horizons (Oe and Oa1 horizons), which are comprised primarily of decomposing forest litter.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 70 to 90 percent in the lower horizons where the organic material fills or partially fills the interstices between rock fragments.  Rock fragments are primarily gravel size with some cobble.  The soil does not freeze in most years due to maritime influence. Reaction is less than 4.5 (0.01M CaCl2) throughout the control section.\nThe organic material has hue ranging from 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma from 0 to 2. Thin mineral horizons, up to 1 inch thick, are present in the control section of some pedons."

The climate is humid maritime with mean annual precipitation about 100 inches and mean annual air temperature of about 41 degrees F. Slope gradient ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from sea level to 100 feet."

Laboratory data for another pedon of the Sokolof series is available at the National Soil Survey Lab.\nThe Sokolof series includes the concept of the tentative Tebenkof series.  Tebenkof series should be dropped.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
