These soils formed in alluvium from sandstone, siltstone, and shale. The mean annual temperature is 57 to 65 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 80 to 84 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches. The frost-free period is 190 to 195 days."

Last revised by state 3/72.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.\nWhen the competing series section was updated in September 2001, questions were raised about the description and/or the classification of this series. It was suggested that this soil should classify in the suborder of Gypsids. A field study of the type location is recommended to resolve the questions.\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 12/2015. The last revision to the series was 6/2005.
