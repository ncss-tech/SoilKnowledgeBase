  "OVERVIEW": "The St. George series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium from sandstone, siltstone, and shale.  These soils are on river flood plains and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 9 inches.",

Last revised by state 3/72.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.\nWhen the competing series section was updated in September 2001, questions were raised about the description and/or the classification of this series. It was suggested that this soil should classify in the suborder of Gypsids. A field study of the type location is recommended to resolve the questions.\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 12/2015. The last revision to the series was 6/2005.
