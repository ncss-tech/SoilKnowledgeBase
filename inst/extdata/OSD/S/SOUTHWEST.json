  "OVERVIEW": "The Southwest series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in recent alluvium over glaciofluvial deposits or glaciolacustrine deposits in depressions on till plains, moraines, and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
