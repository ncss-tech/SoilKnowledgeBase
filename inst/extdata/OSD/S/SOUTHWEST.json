    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Southwest soils are in depressions on moraines, till plains, and outwash plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Southwest soils formed in 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 inches) of recent alluvium overlying glaciofluvial deposits or glaciolacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 787 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 12.8 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation is 177 to 466 meters (580 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level."

The poorly drained Brookston soils are in depressions on till plains. The somewhat poorly drained Crosier soils are on swells on till plains. The moderately well drained Miami, Morley, and Williamstown soils, and the well drained Riddles soils are on backslopes on swells and knolls surrounding depressions."

Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface for some time in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate in the recent alluvium and moderately slow in the buried soil."
