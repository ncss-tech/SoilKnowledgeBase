  "OVERVIEW": "The Sodaspring series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Sodaspring soils are on fan skirts and fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 100 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
