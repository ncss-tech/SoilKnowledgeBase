  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The San Isabel soils typically are noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches but depth to uniformly calcareous material normally ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to the sandy-skeletal IIC horizon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 85 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above depth of 40 inches and are mostly less than 3 inches in diameter.  The soils above depth of 40 inches range from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of\n4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.YR value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically very gravelly sandy loam but clay averages 8 to 18 percent and sand 32 to 82 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR."

Beaverell, Uracca, and Zillman soils are calcareous above depth of 40 inches and have subhorizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation.  Curecanti and Simmont soils halic horizons with more than 18 percent clay and lack sandy-skeletal IIC horizons"

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in alluvial parent materials or glacial outwash derived from a variety of rocks.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 12 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer The mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 62 degrees F."
