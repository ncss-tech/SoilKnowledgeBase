  "OVERVIEW": "The Sunup series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to hard bedrock.  These soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from calcareous shale and sandstone.  Sunup soils are on hillslopes and ridges.  Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
