Accumulation of visible secondary calcium sulfate is not continuous in these soils and ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  The soils are mildly or moderately alkaline.  Few shale chips occur in some pedons.  The control section has 35 to 60 percent clay, 10 to 50 percent silt, and 10 to 50 percent sand.  Hue is 5Y through 10YR, value is 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma is 1 through 3."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sayles soils are on nearly level to sloping sideslopes of hills or ridges at elevations of 3,800 to 5,200 feet.  Slopes typically range from 0 to about 10 percent.  These soils formed in thick, noncalcareous, gypsiferous materials weathered from dark gray, gypsiferous shale.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 7 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual temperature is 45 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 69 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 110 to 140 days."
