The mean summer soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F and the mean winter soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. The difference between the mean summer and winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F. These soils are usually moist and are dry 0 to 30 consecutive days in the summer; udic soil moisture regime. Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. The solum has andic soil properties with 35 to 85 percent rock fragments by volume. The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.30 to 0.70 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus on-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 5 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, 15-bar water retention of 25 to 50 percent for air-dried samples and acid oxalate iron of 1.0 to 2.5 percent. It has 2 to 8 cmol/kg of aluminum. The particle-size control section has 10 to 25 percent field estimated clay and 10 to 30 percent sand. It is strongly or very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3. This horizon has granular, angular blocky, or subangular blocky structure. It has 20 to 40 percent organic matter.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist, and 4 or 6 dry. It is medial loam or medial silt loam and is extremely gravelly, extremely cobbly, or extremely channery. This horizon has angular blocky or subangular blocky structure. It has 7 to 20 percent organic matter."

They formed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone or conglomerate. The soils are in a mild marine climate and have cool, moist summers and cool, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 170 inches. The average January temperature is about 36 degrees F.; the average July temperature is about 57 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 41 to 45 degrees F.
