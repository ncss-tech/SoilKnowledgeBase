The Appanoose, Chariton, and Putnam soils average more than 48 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon.  Belinda soils have thicker E horizons.  Brooklyn and Cisne soils contain more sand in the lower B and C horizons.  In addition, Brooklyn soils are stratified in the lower part of the sola and Cisne soils formed in glacial till.  Cowden, Denny, and Rubio soils have less average clay content in the particle size control section.  Holcomb soils are in areas with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Wagner soils are stratified silt loam, loam, and sandy loam in the lower part of the sola.  Verboort soils have more sand in the solum.  Beckwith soils have thinner mollic surfaces or lighter surface colors.  Edina and Sperry soils have mollic epipedons.  Gifford and Kilwinning soils lack albic horizons.  Kniffin, Mexico, and Pershing soils lack an abrupt textural change between the A and B horizons."
