  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The average annual soil temperature ranges from 49 to 53 degrees F.  Depth to weakly cemented lahar ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The soil is 10 to 25 percent volcanic ash and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Soil reaction ranges from neutral to very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma from 1 to 3 moist and dry.\nThe C and Cqm horizons have value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 0 to 2 moist and dry.  They are 15 to 35 percent pebbles and 5 to 25 percent volcanic ash."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Speelyai soils occupy dissected lahar terraces at elevations of 400 to 600 feet.  They formed in aerially deposited volcanic ash and lahar of sand, gravel, and volcanic ash overlying weakly cemented very gravelly lahar.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The climate is marine and is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 55 to 70 inches, which falls mostly as rainfall during the winter.  The average annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 200 to 240 days."

Sara, Seaquest, and Viola have an argillic horizon.  In addition, Sara and Seaquest soils are fine.  Solo soils are more than 20 inches deep to cemented lahar.  Greenwater soils are deep sand."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",

Native vegetation consists of Douglas-fir, western hemlock, bigleaf maple, and red alder with an understory of western brackenfern, cascade Oregon-grape, salal, western hazel, and trailing blackberry."
