Siliceous and limestone pebbles comprise 0 to 15 percent of any horizon.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Moist values and chromas are less than 3.5, the horizon is less than 10 inches thick.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has a hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  Structure is compound weak or moderate coarse prismatic and weak or moderate fine or medium subangular blocky and granular.\nThe Bk horizons have a hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 4 through 8.  They are loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  The C1ca horizon contains 5 to 20 percent visible secondary carbonates in the form of soft bodies, films, threads, and concretions."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Berda, Berthoud, Karnes, McAllen, Mansic, Midessa, Mobeetie, Ruella, Sabenyo, Seawillow, Spurlock, Veal, and Weymouth series.  Berda, Mansic, Midessa, and Veal soils are dry in the moisture control section for longer periods.  In addition, Berda soils, as well as Ruella soils, lack calcic horizons within 40 inches depth, Mansic soils have a mollic epipedon, and Veal soils, as well as Karnes and Seawillow soils, have carbonatic mineralogy.  Berthoud and Spurlock soils have mean annual soil temperatures of less than 59 degrees F.  Karnes and Mobeetie soils have less than 18 percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section.  McAllen and Sabenyo soils have mean soil temperatures higher than 72 degrees F.  Weymouth soils are less than 40 inches thick over clayey shale."

Slope gradients range from 1 to 15 percent, but are mostly 1 to 8 percent.  The soil formed mainly in calcareous loamy colluvial and old alluvial sediments.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices are 32 to 50 and average annual precipitation ranges from about 21 to 34 inches.  At the type location, the average annual temperature is about 66 degrees F."
