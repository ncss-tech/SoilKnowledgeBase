  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 34 to 72 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Depth to carbonates range from 36 to 72 inches. Depth to the top of the fragipan ranges from 12 to 18 inches. Rock fragments range from 10 to 35 percent in the surface layer and subsurface layers, and from 20 to 60 percent in the fragipan and the substratum. Redoximorphic features consisting of concentrations of iron oxide, iron or clay depletions, and reduced matrices or ped faces occur within 20 inches of the soil surface.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from silt loam through fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through slightly acid. Unplowed areas have an A horizon 2 to 6 inches thick with hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. Some unplowed areas may have a thin O horizon.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Some pedons have a Bw horizon of similar thickness and color hues, but with value of 4, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction in the Eg or Bw horizons ranges from sandy loam through silt loam. Structure is weak platy through weak or moderate subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable through firm. Reaction is extremely acid through slightly acid. In some pedons the Eg is below a Bw.\nThe Bx horizons has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 4, with dominant chroma above 2 in some part within 30 inches of the soil surface. Texture in the fine-earth fraction ranges from sandy loam through silt loam with more than 45 percent sand if hues are 7.5YR or redder. Structure is moderate or strong very coarse prismatic. Prism interiors are massive, or part to weak platy structure. Consistence is firm or very firm, and brittle. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through neutral.\nThe C horizon has range in color and texture similar to the fragipan. Structure is weak or moderate, medium or thick platy or the horizon is massive. Consistence is firm or very firm. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through moderately alkaline. (It is in question whether these horizons are actually Cd. They are left as originally designated at this time.)"

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Morris series is currently the only soil in the same family. Morris soils have less than 45 percent sand in the particle-size control section. The Rexford series was in the same family, but have not been classified to the 8th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Rexford soils have stratified materials within the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Scriba soils are in glacial till plains and slightly concave areas between drumlins. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in glacial till dominated by red and gray sandstone, with less and variable components of limestone and shale. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 45 inches; mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 49 degrees F.; and the frost free period ranges from 120 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 250 to 900 feet above sea-level."
