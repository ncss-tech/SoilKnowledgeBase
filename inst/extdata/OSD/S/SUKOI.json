  "OVERVIEW": "The Sukoi series consists of very shallow, poorly drained soils formed in volcanic ash overlying compact volcanic ash on mountain slopes and lava plains. Slopes range from 0 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is in excess of 60 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: MAST is 38 to 42 degrees F. Thickness of the solum and depth to the paralithic ash ranges from 5 to 10 inches. Phosphorous retention throughout is greater than 90 percent. Bulk density above the paralithic contact ranges from 0.30 to 0.60 grams/cc. Acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus 1/2 iron ranges from 4 to 11 throughout the profile. Moist 15 bar water ranges from 32 to 80 percent. Reaction increases with depth, ranging from extremely acid to slightly acid. Coarse fragment content in the control section ranges from 0 to 5 percent gravel.\nAn Oi horizon is present in some pedons. Combined thickness of the O horizons ranges from 4 to 8 inches. The E horizon has hue from 5YR to 10YR, value from 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is commonly silt loam but ranges to include fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bh horizon has hue from 2.5YR to 10YR, value moist of 2 or 2.5 and chroma moist of 0 or 1. Texture is commonly silt loam but ranges to include fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam. The coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 5 percent gravel.\nThe Bhs or Bs horizon has hue from 5YR to 10YR, value moist from 2 to 3 and chroma moist from 2 to 4. Texture is commonly silt loam but ranges to include fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loam. The coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 5 percent gravel. Mottles are commonly present, but are often masked by the high accumulation of organic matter.\nA buried Oa horizon commonly overlies the Cd horizon.\nThe Cd horizons are composed of strata of ash deposits which vary in texture. Hue ranges from 2.5YR to 10YR, value moist from 3 to 5, and chroma moist from 2 to 6. The coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 60 percent gravel size pumice. Mottles are commonly present. Consistence is very firm or extremely firm with bulk density greater than 1.80 g/cm3."
