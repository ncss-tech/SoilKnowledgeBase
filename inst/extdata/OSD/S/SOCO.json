Ashe, Cardigan, Ditney, Lordstown, Steinsburg, Wakeman, and Yalesville soils have lithic contact within depths of 20 to 40 inches. Brookfield soils are very deep and formed in micaceous till. Buladean and Stecoah soils have paralithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Charlton soils are very deep and formed in glacial till derived mainly from schist, gneiss, or granite. Chestnut soils formed in residuum weathered from high-grade metamorphic rocks and contain fragments of those rocks. Delaware soils are very deep and formed in postglacial alluvium, mainly from areas of sandstone, shale, and siltstone. Dutchess and St. Albans soils are very deep and contain coarse fragments of sedimentary rocks such as sandstone and shale. Edneyville soils are very deep and formed in residuum weathered from high-grade metamorphic rocks and contain fragments of those rocks. Foresthills (T) and Greenbelt (T) soils are very deep and have mantles of humanly transported materials. Gallimore soils are very deep and formed in loamy over sandy outwash on outwash plains. Newport soils have C horizons of dense glacial till. Riverhead soils have a lithologic discontinuity in the upper 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Soco soils are on gently sloping to very steep ridges and side slopes of the Blue Ridge (MLRA 130). Elevation ranges from 1500 to 4800 feet. Slope is commonly between 30 and 70 percent but ranges from 2 to 95 percent. Soco soils formed in residuum that is affected by soil creep in the upper part, and is weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks such as metasandstone or metagraywacke, occasionally interbedded with phyllite or slate. Occasionally they form from residuum weathered from quartzite with a high content of feldspar.  Mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 41 inches near the type location. Mean annual rainfall ranges up to about 75 inches on this soil in Jackson County, North Carolina."

All these soils are on ridges and side slopes except for Brookshire, Citico, Lonon, Maymead, Northcove, Santeetlah, and Spivey soils, which are in coves. Citico soils are fine-loamy and Northcove and Spivey soils are very deep and are loamy-skeletal. Brasstown, Harmiller, Junaluska, Lonon, Shinbone, and Tsali soils have argillic horizons. Brookshire, Cheoah, Jeffrey, Santeetlah, and Spivey soils have umbric epipedons or ochric epipedons with value 3 or less at least 7 inches thick. Cataska and Sylco soils are loamy-skeletal. Marbleyard soils are loamy-skeletal and McCamy soils are fine loamy. Both have a siliceous mineralogy and have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches below the soil surface. Unicoi soils are 7 to 20 inches to a lithic contact."

    "content": "REMARKS: The Soco series was formerly included with the Sylco series. However, Soco soils are not skeletal. The 2/99 revision updated the classification to the 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. This soil is placed in the active CEC activity class based on comparison with associated soils such as Stecoah.\nThis series has the following diagnostic horizons and features:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 6 inches. (Oi and A horizons)\nCambic horizon - the zone from a depth of 6 to 26 inches. (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)\nParalithic contact - the occurrence of weathered bedrock at a depth of 37 inches\n(the upper boundary of the Cr horizon).\nMLRA = 130 SIR = NC0180\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
