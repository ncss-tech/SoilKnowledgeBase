  "OVERVIEW": "The Spinney series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Spinney soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches (483 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F. (4.3 degrees C.).",
