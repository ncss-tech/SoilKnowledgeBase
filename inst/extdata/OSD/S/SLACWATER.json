The 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 inches) particle-size control section averages from 18 to 27 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 2 to 7 and chroma of 1 to 6. It is dominantly silt loam and silty clay loam, but includes strata of silt, loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy fine sand in some pedons."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (0.1417 to 1.417 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate. Flooding is frequent and long to very long duration. Commonly the ground water is at the surface or within 0.46 meter (1.5 feet) of the surface during the late winter and spring or after a flooding event. Some areas of this soil have occasional brief to long periods of ponding, occurring during part or all of the same periods."
