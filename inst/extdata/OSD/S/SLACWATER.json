  "OVERVIEW": "The Slacwater series consists of deep, poorly drained soils formed in calcareous, stratified silty alluvium on flood plains. These soils have moderate permeability. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 864 millimeters (34 inches).",

Commonly the ground water is at the surface or within 0.46 meter (1.5 feet) of the surface during the late winter and spring or after a flooding event. Some areas of this soil have occasional brief to long periods of ponding, occurring during part or all of the same periods."
