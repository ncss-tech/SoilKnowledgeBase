  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness commonly is about 36 inches but ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Free carbonates are absent to depths of 60 inches or more.  The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Typically, it is loam but the range includes clay loam, silty clay loam or silt loam.  It ranges from neutral to strongly acid.   The Bw horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR or 2.5Y 4/2) or grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) or has chroma of 3 if mottles with chroma of 2 or less are common, or if faces of peds are 2 chroma or less.  Few fine faint mottles of 10YR or 2.5Y hue with value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 or 3 are present in the Bw horizon.   The BC horizon has common or many fine and medium distinct mottles of 10YR or 7.5Y hue with value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 6.  The B horizon ranges from medium acid to very strongly acid.   The C horizon commonly is stratified and ranges in texture from silty clay loam to coarse sand.  It is neutral or slightly acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Medway soils.  Similar soils are the Amana, Ambraw, Spillville and Turlin.  Medway soils range from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the solum, and typically are calcareous in the C horizon.  Amana soils have a fine-silty control section. Ambraw soils are poorly drained and have lower chroma in the B horizon.  Spillville and Turlin soils have mollic epipedons more than 24 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Shaffton soils formed in loamy, noncalcareous, alluvial deposits.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 47 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 32 to 36 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ambraw, Elvira, Finchford, and Wapsie soils.  Ambraw soils are slightly lower in elevation or are in swales.  Elvira soils are poorly drained and occupy level or slightly depressional areas.  Finchford soils are coarse textured and excessively drained.  They are on nearly level stream terraces and adjacent truncated escarpments.  Wapsie soils are well drained and are on slightly higher convex slopes."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Stratification and irregular decrease in organic matter required for Fluvaquentic Hapludolls are not readily evident in the horizons described and sampled.  However, since the soils are on flood plains and are frequently flooded, this seems to be the best placement.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 13 inches (Ap and A horizon)  Cambic horizon - the zone from a depth of 13 to 39 inches ( Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, and BC horizons)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
