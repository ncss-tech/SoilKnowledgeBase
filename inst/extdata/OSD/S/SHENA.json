The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick and extends into the Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt1 horizon has 10YR hue, values of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay averaging between 35 and 45 percent clay.  A few siltstone fragments ranging from 1 to 5 mm in size are scattered throughout.\nThe Bt2 horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay.  Siltstone fragments range from 2 to 15 mm in size and 15 to 35 percent by volume.  The fragments are coated with organic stains.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The siltstone has strata of different hardness.  Some strata contain free carbonate."
