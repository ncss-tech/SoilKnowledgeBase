(Akz (part), Bkyz, Byzg and Cyzg horizons)\nGypsic horizon:  The zone from 12 to 90 cm.  (Bkyz, Byzg, Cyzg horizons)\nParalithic contact:  The contact with weathered shale at 90 cm.  (Cr horizon)\nRedoximorphic concentrations:  In the zone from 0 to 90 cm. (Akyz, Akz, Bkyz, Byzg and Cyzg horizons)\nRedoximorphic depletions:  In the zone from 0 to 35 cm. (Akz, Bkyz horizons)\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by samples 97P0108 and 97P0107, National Soil Survey Lab.\nTaxonomic Version:  Eleventh Edition, 2010\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This series was previously identified as the Libbings series.  The Saseep series occurs downslope from seeping irrigation canals, and the soil moisture control section is directly affected by seasonal irrigation.  It is likely that the gypsic horizon is gradually being destroyed by lateral fresh water flow from these canals.  Unexpectedly low EC values may be related to this lateral fresh water flow.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
