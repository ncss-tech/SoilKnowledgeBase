  "OVERVIEW": "The Sanluis series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapid saturated hydraulic conductivity (rapidly permeable) soils that formed in eolian beach sands. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils occur on foredunes on barrier islands. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1245 mm (49 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (68 70 degrees F).",
