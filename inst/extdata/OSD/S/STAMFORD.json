  "OVERVIEW": "The Stamford series consists of moderately deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous clayey alluvium over residuum derived from shale and siltstone. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on hillslopes and pediments on dissected plains. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 533.4 mm (21 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.2 degrees C (63 degrees F).",
