  "OVERVIEW": "The San Sebastian series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on dissected uplands.  They formed in limestone residuum.  Slopes range from 20 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 85 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 29 to 32 inches.  These soils are calcareous throughout.  Fine to medium gravel is present throughout the profile.  These soils have slightly sticky and plastic A horizons and sticky and plastic Bk and C horizons.  Base saturation (by sum of cations) is more than 60 percent at 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon.  CEC is more than 24 meq/100 grams of clay in the major part of the argillic horizon.  Coarse fragments exceeds 35 percent, by volume, throughout the major part of the control section.\nThe A horizons have colors in hues of 7.5YR and 10YR, values of 3 and 4, and chromas of 2, 3 and 4.\nThe Bk horizons range in hues of 7.5YR to 10YR, values of 4 to 5, and chromas of 4 to 8.  Texture of the soil is gravelly clay throughout.  Structure ranges from weak fine to medium subangular blocky."

The Juncal and Machete soils lack the coarse fragments in their profiles and are not calcareous.  The Tanama soils have hard rock within 20 inches of the surface.  The Rio Arriba soils have horizons with COLE values greater than 0.09 and crack when dry."
