  "OVERVIEW": "The Shafter series consists of shallow to a petrocalcic horizon, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone and dolostone with some loess and volcanic ash.  Shafter soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",

The superactive cation exchange activity class was assigned based on soil property data and lab data for adjacent SSL pedons.  The Calcic subgroup recognizes the Bk horizon as a calcic horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A and part of the Bk horizons).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 8 to 36 cm (Bk horizon).\nPetrocalcic horizon - The zone from 36 to 76 cm (2Bkm horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from the soil surface to 36 cm (A and Bk horizons)."
