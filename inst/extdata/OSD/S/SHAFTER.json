  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision of December 2002 updates the taxonomic class from Loamy, mixed, mesic, shallow Typic Petrocalcids.  The superactive cation exchange activity class was assigned based on soil property data and lab data for adjacent SSL pedons.  The Calcic subgroup recognizes the Bk horizon as a calcic horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A and part of the Bk horizons).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 8 to 36 cm (Bk horizon).\nPetrocalcic horizon - The zone from 36 to 76 cm (2Bkm horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from the soil surface to 36 cm (A and Bk horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Previous authors and editors include: HDP-DWW-GJS.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
