  "REVDATE": "12/2009",
  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Shirk series consists of moderately deep; well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from non-calcareous shale. Shirk soils are on hills on sedimentary plains. Slopes range from 10 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 305 millimeters (about 12 inches); the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees Celsius (about 45 degrees Fahrenheit).",
