  "OVERVIEW": "The Spelvin series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in eolian over alluvium. These soils are on interdunes on paleo-terraces in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 74 centimeters (29 inches) and mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C. (56 degrees F.)",
