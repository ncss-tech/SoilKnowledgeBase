  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum commonly is 24 to 45 inches. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 through 4. It is typically sand or loamy sand, but loamy coarse sand and coarse sand are within the range.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 through 8. It is sand or coarse sand but loamy sand or loamy coarse sand are within the range and, when present, generally occur in the upper part of the Bw horizon. Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown in the lower part of the B horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 4 through 8. It generally is coarse sand but sand is within the range. Some pedons have as much as 25 gravel less than 7 mm in diameter at depths below 4 feet."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Soils in similar families are the Canalou, Crevasse, Hodge, Malden, and Sarpy series. Canalou soils contain more silt and slightly more clay. Crevasse soils are subject to frequent flooding and lack hues redder than 10YR in the control section. Hodge soils are mesic and contain more fine sand. Malden soils contain more fine sand and have mixed mineralogy. Sarpy soils have mixed mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Scotco soils formed in sandy alluvial sediments. They are nearly level or gently undulating and slopes typically are 1 to 6 percent but range from 0 to 15 percent. These soils occupy broad, old natural levees. Many areas have a dune-like topography. The mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 65 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 52 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Broseley, Canalou, Diehlstadt, Malden and Sikeston soils. The Diehlstadt and Sikeston soils occur on nearly level or in depressional drainageways and have chroma of 2 or less through the control section. The Broseley soils have loamy argillic horizons and occur on similar landscapes."
