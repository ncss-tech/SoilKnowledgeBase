  "OVERVIEW": "The Simas series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and colluvium from tuffaceous sediments.  Simas soils are on hills and have slopes of 0 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The soils are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for at least half the time (cumulative) during the period the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F, and dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for more than 80 consecutive days during the summer; aridic soil moisture regime.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 60 or more inches.  Total rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to soft powdery secondary lime is 10 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam, with 20 to 40 percent clay, 0 to 20 percent stones, 0 to 30 percent cobbles and 0 to 20 percent gravel.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 through 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  The 2Btk horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.   It is clay, gravelly clay or cobbly clay.  It has 50 to 60 percent clay, 0 to 30 percent cobbles and 0 to 25 percent gravel. It is slightly or moderately alkaline.   The 2Btk horizon is slightly to strongly effervescent.\nThe 2Bk horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.

These soils formed in loess and colluvium in the upper part and old unconsolidated moderately fine and fine textured tuffaceous sediments in the lower part.  The climate is semiarid continental with a mean annual precipitation of 9 to 12 inches but can range to 14 inches when on south-facing slopes.  The mean summer temperature is 60 to 66 degrees F.  The mean winter temperature is 31 to 36 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 160 days."

Lithgow soils have an ochric epipedon and have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Ruckles soils are clayey-skeletal have a lithic contact at 10 to 20 inches and are associated with basalt rimrock.  Searles soils have a medium or moderately fine textured control section.  Tub soils have a mollic epipedon over 20 inches thick.   Willowdale soils are on flood plains and are medium textured."
