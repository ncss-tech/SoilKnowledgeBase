    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 36 to 91 centimeters. Depth to bedrock is more than 152 centimeters. Rock fragment content averages from 35 to 60 percent in the particle-size control section but individual horizons range from 5 to 50 percent in the surface and subsurface horizons, and in the upper part of the subsoil, and  from 35 to 75 percent in the lower part of the subsoil and in the substratum. Rock fragments are mostly gravel, with some cobbles and a few stones. Stones cover up to 3 percent of the surface in some areas. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the solum and from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum. The loamy cap ranges from 25 to 43 centimeters in thickness.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 or 2. The Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4. The E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 1 or 2.  They are very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3. The Bh horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value and chroma of 2 to 3. The Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6.  The B horizon within a depth of 25 centimeters from the mineral soil surface ranges from fine sandy loam to coarse sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction and from 25 to 43 centimeters it ranges from fine sandy loam to coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. It ranges from loamy sand to coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction below 43 centimeters. Consistence is very friable or friable in the upper part of the B horizon, but some pedons have discontinuous cementation. The lower part of the B horizon ranges from loose to friable.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 8. It ranges from loamy sand to coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. Consistence is loose or very friable.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 6. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction, but some pedons have stratification of these textures or strata of gravel and cobbles with sand in the interstices."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sheepscot soils are on outwash plains, terraces, kames, and deltas. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits derived mainly from slate, phyllite, and other dark colored metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, and to a lesser extent from granite, gneiss, schist and other light colored igneous rocks. The climate is humid and cool temperate. The mean annual temperature ranges from 1 to 8 degrees C and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 86 to 122 centimeters. The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 2 to 610 meters above mean sea level."
