  "OVERVIEW": "The Spickard series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash overlying glacial drift and colluvium.  Spickard soils are found on slopes of 0 to 60 percent on debris aprons, debris cones, and valley walls of glaciated mountain landscapes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,900 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
