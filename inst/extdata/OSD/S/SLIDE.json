  "OVERVIEW": "The Slide series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in  alluvium dominantly from limestone.  Slide soils are on fan terraces and  have slopes of 1 to 45 percent.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  The  average annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the average annual  air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
