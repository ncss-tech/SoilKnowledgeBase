Few to common mica flakes are in many pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or loamy sand.\nThe E horizon and Ap horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, chroma 2 through 8.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or loamy sand.\nThe upper Bt1 and Bt2 have hue of 2.5YR value of 4 or 5, chroma of 4 through 8.  Texture is clay, clay loam or sandy clay.  Some pedons have thin Bt1 horizons that have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 6 through 8.  Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Bt3, Bt4 and Bt5 have similar colors and, in addition, have hue of 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, chroma of 6 through 8 with brown, gray, and olive mottles, or it is mottled with gray, red, and brown.  Texture is clay, clay loam or sandy clay.  Some pedons have a heavy sandy clay loam texture in the lower Bt horizon.  Secondary eluviation is present in the less clayey textures.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon ranges from 35 to 55 percent clay."

Series in similar families include the Boswell, Esto, Faceville, Greenville, Kirvin, Luverne, Maben, McQueen, Neshoba, Sacul, Sweatman, Tiak, and Williamsville.  Caroline soils have browner B horizons and stratified lower horizons.  Tuberville soils have red or dark red lower Bt horizons that are not mottles.  Boswell soils have more plastic clays, higher shrink-swell and higher percentage base saturation.  Esto, Faceville, and Greenville soils have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Esto soils are not as red and Greenville soils have dark red Bt horizons.  Kirvin, Luverne, Maben, and Sweatman soils have sola less than 60 inches thick.  McQueen soils have less clayey lower Bt horizons and lack evidence of secondary eluviation.  Neshoba soils have dark red Bt horizons.  Sacul soils have less clayey lower Bt horizons and grayish mottles in the upper Bt horizon.  Tiak soils have grayish mottles in the upper Bt horizon.  Williamsville soils have lower Bt horizons that are less clayey."
