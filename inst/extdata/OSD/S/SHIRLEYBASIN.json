  "OVERVIEW": "The Shirleybasin series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on broad pediment surfaces.  They formed in a thin veneer of alluvium over residuum derived dominantly from fine-grained conglomerate and tuffaceous mudstone.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 41 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  Thickness of the solum is 16 to 35 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  A layer of secondary carbonates occurs at depth of 30 to 60 inches.  The control section has 0 to 15 percent rock fragments.   The control section averages more than 35 percent clay, while some individual subhorizons may have less than 35 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam, sandy clay loam and clay loam.  Reaction is neutral and mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is clay, clay loam, sandy clay, or sandy clay loam.  The horizon is dominantly 35 to 40 percent clay but ranges from 25 to 45 percent clay in some subhorizons.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline but dominantly neutral or mildly alkaline.\nWhere a Bt3 is present, hue is 10YR and 2.5Y, value is 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma is 3 through 6.  It is clay, sandy clay, sandy clay loam, and clay loam.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline but dominantly mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y with 5YR or 7.5YR in some lower layers.  Value is 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist.  Chroma is 2 through 6.  Texture is dominantly sandy loam to sandy clay but also includes loamy sand.  It is dominantly 10 to 25 percent clay.  This horizon commonly has 0 to 15 percent fine pebbles but may range from 15 to 50 percent fine pebbles in some thin layers.  Structure may range from strong coarse prismatic to massive depending upon the degree of weathering in this highly variable thinly interbedded material. Reaction is dominantly neutral to moderately alkaline with some strongly and very strongly alkaline lower layers."

Elevation is 7,000 to 7,400 feet.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  The frost-free season is about 85 to 110 days depending upon aspect and air drainage."
