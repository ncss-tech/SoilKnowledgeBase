  "OVERVIEW": "The Sandview series consist of very deep, well drained soils formed in a thin mantle of silty material and residuum weathered from limestone.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and moderately slow in the lower part.  These nearly level to moderately steep soils are on upland ridges, side slopes, and toe slopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 46 inches.",
