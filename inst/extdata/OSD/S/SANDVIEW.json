Fragments are limestone, siltstone, chert, or shale.  The soil ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the upper part of the solum and from strongly acid to mildly alkaline in the lower part of the solum and substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4, but the Ap to a depth of 7 inches after mixing has value moist of 4 or more.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium, granular or subangular blocky.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons are mottled in shades of brown in the lower part.  It is a silt loam or silty clay loam.
