  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum is greater than 60 inches. Depth to the fragic layer ranges from 18 to 36 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. The soil is moderately acid to very strongly acid except the surface layer is less acid where limed. Content of pebbles is typically from 0 to 10 percent throughout, but ranges as high as 30 percent in individual subhorizons. The silt content is more than 20 percent in the particle-size control section.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 4. Texture is loam or silt loam.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 or 6. Texture is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles of 2 chroma or less occur within a depth of 30 inches from the surface. Texture is dominantly loam or clay loam, but includes silt loam.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles of chroma 2 or less accompanied by higher chroma mottles range from few to many. Texture is dominantly loam or clay loam, but includes silt loam. Some pedons have evidence of a discontinuity at the contact between the Bt and the Btx horizons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the  Atlee and Eylau soils in the same family and the Ardilla, Cedarbluff, Hendon, Shack and Tasso soils in closely related families. Ardilla soils have less than 20 percent silt. Atlee soils formed in coastal plain sediments on uplands. Cedarbluff soils are somewhat poorly drained and have plinthite in the Bt horizon. Eylau soils formed in coastal plain sediments on uplands and have tongues or interfingering of an E horizon in the lower part of the Bt horizon. Hendon, Shack and Tasso soils do not have gray mottles within 30 inches of the surface. Hendon soils formed in a loamy mantle and the underlying residuum of sandstone and siltstone, and they are mesic. Shack and Tasso soils both contain chert fragments and are underlain by cherty residuum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Swafford soils are on low stream terraces, toe slopes, and foot slopes. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in loamy alluvium or a mixture of colluvium and alluvium. The mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 53 inches near the type location."

The moderately well drained Hamblen and well drained Sullivan soils are on adjacent floodplains and do not have argillic horizons. The well drained Sequatchie and moderately well drained Whitwell soils also occur on low stream terraces, but do not have fragic properties."
