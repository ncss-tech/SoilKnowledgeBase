Seasonal water table is between 90 and 150 cm during the late winter or spring.  Saturated at depths of 75 to 100 cm during the spring in most years.\nMean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.\nValue:  5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.\nChroma:  1 through 3 dry, 2 through 4 moist.\nDepth to strongly cemented duripan: 38 to 50 cm.\nReaction: Strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline, decreasing with increasing depth.\nMineralogy:  Mixed but has influence from volcanic ash and other pyroclastic materials.\nSalt and sodium: These soils are moderately or strongly salt and sodium affected in their upper profile, and slightly affected in their lower profile.\nOther features: Strata of unconformable gravelly sand and sandy loam are common at any depth below the continuous silica-cemented layer.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content:  Averages 20 to 30 percent.\nSand fraction: Less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser particles.\nA2 and Bw horizons\nTexture:  Silt loam or silty clay loam, when averaged.\nC horizons\nVariable amount of mica are common in some pedons.\nFaint or distinct yellowish brown mottles are common in the lower part of the profile."

These soils formed in loess capping alluvium or lake sediments derived from mixed rocks influenced by volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 1,220 to 1,525 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."
