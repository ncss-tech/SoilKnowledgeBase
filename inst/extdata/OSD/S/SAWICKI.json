  "OVERVIEW": "The Sawicki series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium or colluvium derived from hard fine grained igneous rock, gneiss, schist and sandstone.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, drainageways, escarpments, hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.",
