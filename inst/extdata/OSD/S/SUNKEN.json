Sunken soil mapunit areas are experiencing tidal salt marsh ecosystem conversion as the marsh is slowly migrating to these low-lying upland forested areas.  Sunken soils provide essential plant and animal habitat, water quality benefits, and coastal protection from storms and sea level rise.\nNatural Vegetation--Typically consist of stunted loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), saltmeadow cordgrass (Spartina patens), saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), marsh-elder (Iva frutescens), poison ivy (Rhus radicans), and groundsel-tree (Baccharis halimifolia)."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nSunken soils were previously mapped as Tidal Marsh and Swamp miscellaneous areas and with the Elkton and Othello soil series as inclusions in the low phase map units. These soils may become extremely acid if drained. Sunken soils are classified as Alfisols due to elevated base saturation (35 percent or greater) resulting from saturation with base-rich saline water (sum of base saturation analysis conducted at the University of Maryland in 1988 on samples averaged 63 percent).\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Thirteenth Edition):\nAquic conditions--the zone from 0 to 200 centimeters is continuously saturated (endosaturation)\nFibric soil materials--the zone from 0 and 5 centimeters has a fiber content after rubbing that is three-fourths, by volume\nSapric soil materials--the zone from 5 to 10 centimeters has a fiber content after rubbing that is less than one-sixth, by volume\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 46 centimeters (Oi, Oa, Ag, Eg horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 46 to 165 centimeters (Btg1 and 2Btg2 horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity--97 to 200 centimeters\nParticle size control section--46 to 96 centimeters (Btg1 horizon)"
