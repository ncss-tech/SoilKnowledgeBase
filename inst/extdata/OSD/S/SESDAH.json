    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sesdah soils are on mountains. They formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from glassy tuff-breccia. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 4,690 to 7,160 feet. The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 26 inches, most of which comes as snow. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

Hartner soils are less than 10 inches to bedrock and do not have a mollic epipedon or an argillic horizon. Lyonman soils have bedrock within 20 to 40 inches. Welltomas soils have lithic material within 7 to 14 inches."
