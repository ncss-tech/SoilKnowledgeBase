  "OVERVIEW": "The Sesdah series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from glassy tuff-breccia. Sesdah soils are on mountains. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
