Siliceous or ironstone pebbles range from none to few throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has colors in hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, chroma 2 to 4.  The E horizon has value or chroma 1 to 2 units greater than the A horizons.  Texture of the A and E horizons is fine sand or loamy fine sand.  The reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bt1 horizon has colors with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, chroma of 4 to 8 with or without grayish or reddish mottles.  Lower Bt horizons are mottled in shades of yellow, brown, red, and gray or they have gray matrix with reddish, yellowish, or brownish mottles.  Wetness mottles with chroma of 2 or less are at a depth of 10 to 30 inches. The texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid."

The soils formed in sandy clay loams and sandy loams mainly of Lower Cretaceous age.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 34 inches; the mean annual temperature ranges from 63 to 68 degrees F.; and the Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 44 to 54. Frost free period is 230 to 240 days and elevation ranges from 400 to 1100 feet."
