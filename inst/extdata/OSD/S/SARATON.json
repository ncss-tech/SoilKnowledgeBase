  "STATES": "CO,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Saraton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium, over marl at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Saraton soils are on mesas, benches, and terraces and have slopes of 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to marl ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Calcium carbonate content in this marl is over 50 percent.  The control section is typically very gravelly loam or light clay loam, but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent by volume in a major part of the control section and are mainly basalt.  Gravel, cobbles, and stones are also cemented in the marl in varying amounts.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 58 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 78 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 1OYR or 7.5YR."

The mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 70 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 150 days."
