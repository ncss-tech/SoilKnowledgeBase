They are on hill slopes and mountainsides with slopes of 10 to 50 percent but range from 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is 68 to 76 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 6 to 13 inches. Most precipitation occurs as intense rain during afternoon convectional thunderstorms from June to October. The frost-free period is 240 to 280 days and the elevation is 1,800 to 3,500 feet, ranging up to 4,500 feet."
