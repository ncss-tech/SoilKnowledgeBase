They are on hill slopes and mountainsides with slopes of 10 to 50 percent but range from 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is 68 to 76 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 6 to 13 inches. Most precipitation occurs as intense rain during afternoon convectional thunderstorms from June to October.
