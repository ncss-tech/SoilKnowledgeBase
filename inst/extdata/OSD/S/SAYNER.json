  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 12 to 36 inches. Total volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent in the particle-size and series control section.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the solum and 15 to 35 percent in the substratum. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum and from strongly acid to slightly acid below the spodic horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR or it is neutral in hue. Value is 2 to 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.  It is loamy sand or sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loamy sand or sand.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is typically loamy sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, or coarse sand, but in some pedons it is the gravelly analogs.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR and value and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, coarse sand or the gravelly analogs.  BC horizons with spodic colors have pH greater than 5.9 or have organic carbon content less than 0.6 percent.\nThe C horizon has colors like the BC horizon.  It is more than 90 percent sand.  Stratification is common. Individual strata are sand or coarse sand or the gravelly, very gravelly or extremely gravelly analogs.  Some pedons have thin strata of gravel."

Duel and Ishpeming soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  East Lake and Hartwick soils have free carbonates within 40 inches. Karlin soils have a mantle of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy fine sand in the upper part of the series control section and have less than 15 percent rock fragments.  Kiva soils have  a 10 to 20 inch loamy mantle and have free carbonates within 40 inches. Rousseau soils have more than 50 percent fine sand and no rock fragments in the series control section. Rubicon and Vilas soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments throughout the series control section.  Sultz (T) soils have stratified loamy, or loamy and sandy, strata in the lower part of the series control section and average less than 90 percent sand there."

Slope gradients range from 0 to 60 percent.  Slopes are complex in many places.  Sayner soils formed in stratified or unsorted sandy and gravelly outwash.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature range from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 90 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 680 to 1950 feet."
