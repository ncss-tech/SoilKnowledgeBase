  "OVERVIEW": "The Selway series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in material derived from granite and gneiss.  These soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
