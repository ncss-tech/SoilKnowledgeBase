  "BYREV": "Rev. RWG/WDL/JPM",
  "REVDATE": "11/2002",
  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The St. Nicholas series consists of shallow to schist, poorly drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum.  These soils occur on gently sloping to very steep backslopes of hills, mountains, and valleysides.  Slopes range from 5 to 100 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is in excess of 120 inches and the mean annual temperature is 40 degrees F.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are: a spodic horizon from 2 to 14 inches;  weighted average of more than 35 percent coarse fragments from 0 to 14 inches;  histic epipedon from 7 inches to 0, mottling throughout the spodic horizon;  a cryic temperature regime is assumed;  assumed less than 6 percent organic carbon in the upper 4 inches of the spodic horizon.  The spodic horizon is identified based on field morphology alone.  The St. Nicholas series is proposed as a benchmark soil series.  The St. Nicholas series formerly classified as thixotropic-skeletal."
