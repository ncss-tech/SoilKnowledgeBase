    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  St. Nicholas soils occur on gently sloping to very steep hillslopes and valleysides, and are underlain by noncalcareous bedrock.  The climate is humid maritime with mean annual precipitation in excess of 120 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F and the mean summer air temperature is about 50 degrees F. The slope gradient ranges from 5 to 100 percent.  Elevations range from sea level to 2400 feet."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  St. Nicholas soils are used for watershed protection, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  The overstory vegetation consists of Alaska yellow-cedar, western hemlock, mountain hemlock, and Sitka spruce.  The understory vegetation is mainly blueberry species, deer cabbage, and false hellebore."

    "section": "REMARKS",

The spodic horizon is identified based on field morphology alone.  The St. Nicholas series is proposed as a benchmark soil series.
