  "OVERVIEW": "The Skagit series consists of very deep, drained and protected soils that are naturally poorly drained and subject  to flooding.  They formed in recent alluvium and volcanic ash on floodplains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The  average annual precipitation is about 32 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees.",
