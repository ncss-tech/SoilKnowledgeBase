  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Salhouse soils are on stable dunes on beach ridges and sand sheets on lakebeds. These soils formed in eolian material derived from volcanic ash over lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. Elevations range from 1,280 to 1,375 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

Morehouse soils are not calcareous, have sodium adsorption ratios less than 13, and occur on adjacent dunes. Thornlake soils have cambic horizons and are on adjacent lakebeds that are not mantled by recent eolian material."
