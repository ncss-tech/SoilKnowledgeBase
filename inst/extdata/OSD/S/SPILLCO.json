  "OVERVIEW": "The Spillco series consists of very deep, moderately well or somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soil formed in alluvium on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C (46 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 66 centimeters (26 inches).",
