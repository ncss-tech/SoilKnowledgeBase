  "OVERVIEW": "The Sitkum series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granitic rocks.  Sitkum soils are on mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 30 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.  The particle-size control section averages 12 to 18 percent clay and 15 percent or more sand that is coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry. It is sandy loam, loam, or gravelly sandy loam with 12 to 18 percent clay.  It has 0 to 20 percent gravel.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid."

Steinmetz soils are associated with Sitkum soils on less steeply sloping, more stable positions. Buckshot and Stinger soils have a udic moisture regime and are on adjacent north slopes.  Lettia soils are fine-loamy and on less steeply sloping, more stable hill slopes. Sharpshooter soils are fine-loamy and derived from mica schists. Zing soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Beal soils are moderately well drained.  Beal and Zing soils are on foot slopes and in concave areas on side slopes."
