The soil has properties and occurs on appropriate landforms to support the concept of human-transported materials.  The use of the Anthroportic subgroup is not currently permitted in the xeric soil moisture regime, but will be explored for future consideration for correlation.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nUser Site ID: S2015CA037001\nLab Pedon Number: 15N0539\nClassified using the Twelfth Edition Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2014)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
