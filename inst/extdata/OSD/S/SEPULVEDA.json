  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sepulveda series are well drained soils that formed in human-transported material (HTM) found on alluvial fan remnants that originate from sedimentary sources. Sepulveda soils are on cut/fill and localized raised land in areas that have been graded. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C.",

The soil has properties and occurs on appropriate landforms to support the concept of human-transported materials.  The use of the Anthroportic subgroup is not currently permitted in the xeric soil moisture regime, but will be explored for future consideration for correlation.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nUser Site ID: S2015CA037001\nLab Pedon Number: 15N0539\nClassified using the Twelfth Edition Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2014)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
