  "OVERVIEW": "The Snowlin series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from basalt and other basic igneous rocks and pumice or ash.  Snowlin soils are in mountainous terrain and have slopes of 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Thickness of the solum is from 30 to 70 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 15 to 35 percent rock fragments and 27 to 35 percent clay.  Stone lines are common in some pedons in areas with slopes greater than 10 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 through 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry in the upper part and value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry in the lower part.  It has 15 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  It has a moist bulk density of 0.85 to 0.95 g/cubic centimeter.  It is strongly to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.
