The soil are usually moist but are dry 30 to 60 consecutive days during the summer.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more. Thickness of the solum is from 30 to 70 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 15 to 35 percent rock fragments and 27 to 35 percent clay.  Stone lines are common in some pedons in areas with slopes greater than 10 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 through 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry in the upper part and value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry in the lower part.  It has 15 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  It has a moist bulk density of 0.85 to 0.95 g/cubic centimeter.  It is strongly to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is gravelly or cobbly clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay, 0 to 25 percent cobbles and 0 to 20 percent gravel."

The soils formed in colluvium weathered basalt and other basic igneous rocks and mixed with ash and pumice in the upper part.  The climate is humid with cold wet winters and cool dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 70 inches; mean annual temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F; the mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F; and the mean July temperature is about 55 degrees F.  The frost free period is less than 100 days."
