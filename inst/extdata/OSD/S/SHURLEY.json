  "OVERVIEW": "The Shurley series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from gneiss, schist, and granite rock.  These soils are on hills, mountains, and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
