  "OVERVIEW": "The Sanyon series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from vitric tuff.  Sanyon soils are on hills.  Slopes are 20 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
