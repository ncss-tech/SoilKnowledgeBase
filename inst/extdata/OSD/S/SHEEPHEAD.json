  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a paralithic contact is 6 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature above bedrock is about 58 degrees F. and the soil temperature is above 47 degrees F. after mid-February or is not below 47 degrees F.  at any time.  Soil below a depth of 8 inches is usually moist in some or all parts from about December 1 until late May and is continuously dry the rest of the time.  The base saturation is 65 to 75 percent.  Cobbles make up to 20 percent and gravel makes up an additional 5 to 25 percent of the rock fragments in the soil profile.  The profile is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe A horizon is brown, dark brown, grayish brown or dark gray (10YR 5/3, 5/2, 4/3, 4/2, 4/1). Moist color is very dark brown, very dark grayish brown, or dark brown (10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3).\nSome pedons have a C horizon of soil material above the paralithic contact.  It is grayish brown, brown, yellowish brown, pale brown or light yellowish brown (10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/6, 6/3, 6/4) and is slightly acid or medium acid."

Crafton soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Crouch soils lack a lithic contact within 40 inches of the surface.  Friant soils have a mean annual soil temperature warmer than 59 degrees F.  and have a lithic contact within a depth of 20 inches.  Tollhouse soils have base saturation of more than 75 percent."

The soils formed in material weathered from granitic rocks.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 50 inches of which some is snow.  The mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F.; the average January temperature is about 44 degrees F.; and the average July temperature is about 70 degrees F.  The frost free period is 150 to 225 days."
