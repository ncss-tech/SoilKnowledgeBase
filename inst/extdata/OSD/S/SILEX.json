  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Silex series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived mostly from limestone and sandstone.  Silex soils are on mountain slopes, mesas, and structural benches.  Slopes range from 10 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
