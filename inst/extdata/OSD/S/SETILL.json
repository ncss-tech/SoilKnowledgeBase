  "OVERVIEW": "The Setill series consists of moderately deep to densic material, well drained soils formed in compact glacial till from sedimentary and volcanic rock with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  These soils are on backslopes and footslopes of mountains and foothills.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
