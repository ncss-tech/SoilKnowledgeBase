The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths at 8 to 24 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.00 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent rock fragments and 20 to 35 percent clay.  Depth to densic material is 25 to 35 inches.\nThe A horizon has values of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.  It has 5 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe BA horizon has values of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 3 dry or moist.  It is gravelly ashy loam or very gravelly ashy loam.  It has 15 to 35 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has values of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  It is very gravelly loam or very gravelly clay loam.  It has 30 to 40 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.

These soils formed in glacial till from sedimentary and volcanic rock with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent.  Climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 23 to 28 degrees F.; The average July temperature ranges from 63 to 68 degrees F.; and the average annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.; and the frost free season ranges from 100 to 130 days."

Santop soils are on shoulders and upper backslopes, have a frigid temperature regime and are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.  Nicmar soils are on backslopes and footslopes, have a frigid temperature regime and lack a mollic epipedon."
