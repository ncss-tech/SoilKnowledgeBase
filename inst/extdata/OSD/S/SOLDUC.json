The soil moisture control section is dry for 30 to 45 consecutive days; udic moisture regime. The solum thickness and depth to sandy-skeletal material is 20 to 40 inches. The solum has andic soil properties with moist bulk density of 0.50 to 0.90 g/cc, phosphate retention of 85 to 100, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron of 2 to 4 percent and 15 bar water of 15 to 30 percent on air-dried samples. Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent. It is very strongly or strongly acid throughout the profile. The lower part (thinnest part) of the particle-size control section lacks andic soil properties.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4. It has 10 to 20 percent organic matter. It has 4 to 8 cmol/kg of aluminum.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6. It is very gravelly medial sandy loam, extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, or very gravelly medial loam. It has 5 to 15 percent organic matter, dropping to less than 7 percent below a depth of 15 inches from the mineral soil surface. It has 2 to 3 cmol/kg of aluminum.\nSome pedons have a BC or 2CB horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 6. It is very gravelly medial sandy loam or extremely gravelly loamy sand.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 6 moist. It is extremely gravelly loamy sand, extremely cobbly loamy sand, extremely gravelly sand, or extremely cobbly sand."

Necanicum soils are on mountain, very deep and lack the contrasting sandy-skeletal substratum. Klone soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to sandy-skeletal substratum. Mudcreek soils are moderately deep to dense till. Southshore soils are deep to cemented till. Grismar soils are on mountains."

The soils are in a mild marine climate and have cool, moist summers and cool, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 80 to 125 inches. The average January temperature is about 38 degrees F.; the average July temperature is about 61 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 45 to 49 degrees F. The frost free season is 140 to 220 days."
