  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the dense glacial till (densic contact) is 25 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 49 to 51 degrees F. The soil is usually moist but is dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The particle size control section is 15 to 30 percent rock fragments that are mostly pebbles but some are cobbles.  Apparent clay in the particle-size control section is less than 18 percent.  Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are at depths greater than 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry.  This horizon is mottles in some pedons.  It is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe BC horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist.  It is strongly acid or moderately acid."

Cathcart, Cathlamet, Chelan, Chuckanut, Giles, Nevat, Pastik, Ponto, and Sulsavar soils lack a paralithic contact within 40 inches.  Nati soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact with sandstone.  Sehome soils are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sadie soils are on hills at elevations of 200 to 1,400 feet.  They formed in ablation till over dense very compact glacial till.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  These soils are in a mild marine climate and have cool, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 55 to 75 inches.  The average January temperature is about 37 degrees F.; the average July temperature is about 60 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.  The frost free season is 160 to 190 days.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 210 to 250 days."

Bellingham and Tealwhit soils have an aquic moisture regime and a fine control section with less than 15 percent coarse fragments.  Palix soils have an umbric epipedon and more than 35 percent soft rock fragments in the control section.  Lyre soils are deep and loamy-skeletal.  Semiahmoo soils are Histosols."
