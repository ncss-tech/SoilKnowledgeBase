  "OVERVIEW": "The Sadie series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in ablation till over dense, very compact glacial till.  These soils are on hills and have slopes from 0 to 35 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 65 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The soil is usually moist but is dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The particle size control section is 15 to 30 percent rock fragments that are mostly pebbles but some are cobbles.  Apparent clay in the particle-size control section is less than 18 percent.  Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are at depths greater than 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry.  This horizon is mottles in some pedons.  It is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe BC horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist.  It is strongly acid or moderately acid."
