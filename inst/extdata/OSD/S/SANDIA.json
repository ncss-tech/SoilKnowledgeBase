Kutler soils are in the 17 to 20 inch rainfall zone.\nLabre soils: are very deep\nPerma soils: have carbonates accumulated in the C horizons. Perma soils have 40 to 80 percent gravel in the 10- to 40-inch section.\nPeso soils: have Bk horizons with 6 to 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches; have carbonates accumulated in the C horizons and formed in parent material derived from limestone\nRenegade soils: have paralithic contact between 40 to 60 inches.\nSlimbutte soils: are calcareous at a shallow depth and fragmental below 40 inches.\nSubwell soils: have a discontinuity at 10 to 20 inches, secondary carbonate accumulation and are non-skeletal above the discontinuity.\nTowave soils: do not have a cambic horizon.\nVeatch soils: derived from sedimentary parent material and are deep.\nVigilante soils: deep\nWalstead soils: have calcic horizons\nWanagan soils: calcareous at shallow depths and contain a lithologic discontinuity at 12 to 20 inches.\nWimper soils: have calcic horizons and deep"
