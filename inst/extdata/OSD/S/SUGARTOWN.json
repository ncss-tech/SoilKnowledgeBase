    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  The combined thickness of A, E, BE, and Bt horizons is less than 30 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A, E, BE, Bt, and Btg horizons and from extremely acid to slightly acid in the 2Cg horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has a hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y in some pedons.  Grayish, reddish or yellowish mottles range from few to many in the Bt horizon.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 60 percent.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles are in shades of red or brown.  Some pedons have mottled gray, brown, and red Btg horizons.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay.\nThe 2C, 2Cg, and BCg horizons, where present, are in shades of red, brown, and yellow and have the same texture as the Btg horizon."

Brantley soils lack gray mottles in the B horizon, have hue that ranges to 2.5YR in the Bt horizon and the solum is less than 60 inches thick.  Canton Bend, Cowton, Gundy, Maben, Magnet, Mecklenburg, Meth, and Spray soils have hue redder than 7.5YR.  In addition, Canton Bend, Gundy, Magnet, Mecklenburg, and Spray soils are underlain by bedrock or saprolite.  Capshaw and Hampshire soils have solums less than 60 inches thick and are underlain by hard limestone at depths less than 60 inches.  Enon and Zion soils have solums less than 60 inches thick and are underlain by hard bedrock within 60 inches.  Skyuka soils lack gray mottles in the B horizon and have hue that ranges to 5YR in the Bt horizon.  Zuber soils have sandy A and AB horizons and have limestone fragments throughout."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sugartown soils are on convex side slopes and ridge tops on Coastal Plains.  Slope gradients range from 1 to 12 percent.  These soils formed in stratified clayey and loamy, early to mid Pleistocene alluvium.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 68 degrees F. and average rainfall averages 45 to 59 inches."

Beauregard and Kolin soils are on concave side slopes and have fine-silty control sections.  Blevins soils are on positions similar to Sugartown soils and have fine-silty control sections.  Gore soils are on gently sloping to strongly sloping positions on escapements adjacent to floodplains and drainageways.  Gore soils have hue of 2.5YR and 5YR in upper argillic horizons."
