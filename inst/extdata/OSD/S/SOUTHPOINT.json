  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Southpoint soils were formerly included with areas of water.  They are distinguished by being permanently covered by estuarine waters that support limited submersed aquatic vegetation.  These soils would classify in the proposed Thapto-histic subgroup.  The original proposed series name was spelled South Point.  Refer to Subaqueous Soil Survey of Sinepuxent Bay, Maryland; G.P. Demas, J.H. Brown, and M.C. Rabenhorst; July 1998.\nDiagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon (oxidized)--the zone from 0 to 2 inches (0 to 5 centimeters) (Ag horizon)\nPeraquic feature--the zone from 0 to 60 inches (0 to 150 centimeters) is permanently saturated\nSulfidic feature--The zone from 4 to 36 inches (10 to 91 centimeters) contains sulfidic materials (verified by moist incubation)\nThapto-histic feature--the zone from 36 to 60 inches (91 to 152 centimeters) (3Oeb and 3Oab horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nThis pedon was sampled as S97MD047-001 and later entered into NASIS as 1997MD047111.  Radiocarbon analysis of a wood sample from the buried organic layer at a depth of 36 inches yielded a date of 1400 years B.P.\nData Map Unit ID: 679314\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
