  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the human transported materials ranges from 100 to 200 cm or more. The content of coarse fragments averages more than 35 percent (by weight) throughout the particle size control section, of which more than 10 percent are anthropogenic artifacts. Soil textures typically include sandy loam to silt loam, although some pedons contain horizons with soil textures of loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or coarse sand. Artifactual, very artifactual or extremely artifactual modifiers are common.  Lithological discontinuities are common features in many pedons.  Reaction classes range from extremely acid to moderately alkaline. Hue ranges from 5YR to 5Y throughout.  The soil is typically saturated for a portion of the year with in a depth of 150 centimeters and may or may not have redoximorphic features.\nThe ^A, ^Au or ^ACu horizons have value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Structure is massive, subangular blocky or granular. Consistence is very friable or friable; some pedons are firm or very firm due to compaction.\nThe ^C or ^Cu, horizons have value of 2 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 8. Structure is typically massive; sandy subhorizons may be single grain. Consistence is friable to very firm. Sandy subhorizons may be loose.\nSome pedons have a ^Cg or ^Cgu horizon below 100 centimeters with value of 4 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Structure is massive and consistence is friable."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Secaucus soils are on nearly level to gently sloping artificially created landforms, often adjacent to areas of wetlands and waterbodies.  These soils formed in human transported material consisting of construction debris intermingled and mixed with natural soil materials which was used to fill wet areas. The construction debris material commonly originates from the demolition of buildings and roads. The dominant coarse fragments in the construction debris are concrete, asphalt, bricks, coal ash, coal slag and steel with some natural rocks sparsely intermingled. The human transported natural soil material is dominantly from locally excavated upland materials such as alluvium, till, outwash, or coastal plain sediments. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1021 to 1325 millimeters. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 17 degrees Celsius."

Canarsie, Centralpark, and Greenbelt soils average less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section. Greatkills soils have refuse within the control section. Laguardia soils are found nearby on higher portions the artificial landscape."

The potential for surface runoff is low to medium in forested and brushy areas; high to very high in areas of turf where compaction is a problem. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in areas where the soil has not been compacted and moderately low in areas of compaction."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of these soils are used for recreation, wildlife habitat, or industrial and urban development. Common plants include turfgrass, mugwort, common reed, gray birch, popular, stag horn sumac, goldenrod, blackberry, Japanese knotweed.  Recreational use is unlikely in areas where the surface is unsmoothed, or where the surface fragments have not been removed or covered."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Secaucus soils often exhibit an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth however this is a result of anthropogenic filling (deposition) not alluvial deposition; excluding them from the concept of Fluvents. Proposed revisions to soil taxonomy in ICOMANTH Circular Letter 7 developed for anthropogenic soils will help to clarify this difference.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - 0 to 15 centimeters (^Au horizon).\n2. Loamy-skeletal - rock fragments average (by volume) 35 percent or more in the particle size control section (25 to 100 centimeters).\n3. Oxyaquic subgroup - saturation below 100 centimeters.\n4. In coal slag horizons, the carbon content is from these materials and should not have a mucky modifier. Carbon contents are not related to organic material deposition.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Full characterization data on pedon 2010NJ017008. Pedon analyzed by the NSSL, Lincoln, NE, 2010. The typical pedon is no. 2010NJ017002. Support pedons used to develop this series include 2011NY085001, 2010NJ017013 and 2010NJ017014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
