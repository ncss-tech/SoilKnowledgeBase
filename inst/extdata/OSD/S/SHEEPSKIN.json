    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Most areas of the Sheepskin series were mapped as the Tindahay series in the Fort Hall Area Soil Survey, 1977.  The Sheepskin Soils are being differentiated by having a coarse-loamy particle-size control section.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 12 inches (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons)\nTorrifluventic subgroup - Sheepskin soils occur within an area with an aridic moisture regime that is bordering on xeric.  The soil is assumed to have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth based on stratification of texture and soil color within the profile.\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the Ap2 horizon, the Bw1, Bw2, and C1 horizons, and part of the C2 horizon)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
