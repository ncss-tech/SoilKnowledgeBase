  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to continuous horizons of carbonate accumulation ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 10 to 25 inches.  Depth to the paralithic contact and bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The weighted average organic carbon content of the surface 15 inches is about 0.4 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 51 degrees F.  The rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent angular pebbles throughout.  EC is less than 4 mmhos throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture is sandy clay loam with clay ranging from 20 to 35 percent and sand from 45 to 75 percent of which more than 35 percent is fine sand or coarser.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon, when present, has the combined properties of the Bt and Bk horizons.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam with 10 to 25 percent clay.  This horizon contains about 4 to 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  A C horizon is present in some pedons.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline."

All these soils except Bacobi, Grazane, Kiki, and Neiber are very deep.   Bacobi and Grazane soils have average annual soil temperature of more than 51 degrees F. Kiki soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Neiber soils have less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Saddle soils are on gently sloping to rolling pediments, hill toeslopes, footslopes, and ridges.  These soils formed in residuum and slopewash alluvium derived primarily from sandstone interbedded with sandy shale and siltstone.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,000 to 6,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and ranges from 5 to 9 inches of which about half falls as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from about 41 to 45 degrees F.  The estimated frost-free season ranges from 110 to 135 days depending upon aspect, elevation, and air drainage."

Oceanet soils are undeveloped and shallow or very shallow.  They occur on ridge and hill backslopes and crests.  Wallson soils are coarse-loamy and deep.  They occur intermixed with the Saddle soils."
