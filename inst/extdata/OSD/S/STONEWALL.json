  "OVERVIEW": "The Stonewall series consists of very deep, well drained soils on slightly convex fan piedmont remnants. These soils formed in mixed alluvium derived mainly from volcanic tuffs and related rocks.  Slopes are 8 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.",
