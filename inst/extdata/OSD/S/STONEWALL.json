    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stonewall soils are on slightly convex erosional fan remnants of the fan piedmont.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, mainly volcanic tuffs and related rocks.  Slopes are 8 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,345 to 1,590 meters.  The climate is cool and semiarid with cool moist winters; summers are hot and dry with occasional convection storms.  The mean annual precipitation is 130 to 200 mm and the mean annual soil temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C.  The frost-free season is 120 to 170 days."
