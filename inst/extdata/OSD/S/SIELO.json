    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to soft bedrock ranges from 6 to 70 inches.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 35 percent in the control section and are mainly thin and flat and less than 6 inches in length.  These soils are usually moist in some parts of the soil between depths of 4 to 12 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 36 to 42 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at depth of 20 inches is about 53 to 57 degrees F.  The E and upper Bt horizons are mainly calcareous and the BC and C horizons are slightly calcareous to violently calcareous.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 4 to 6.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 6 to 8.  It ranges from clay loam and gravelly clay loam to clay and gravelly clay with about 35 to 45 percent clay."

Series in similar families are the Bead, Chubbs, Cluff, Hatch, Lubrecht, Maukey, Mikesell, McVickers, Soldier, Swapps and Wetterhorn series.  Hatch soils have an E horizon 2 to 4 inches thick that does not tongue into the Bt horizon.  Cluff soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments.  Swapps soils have a Bt horizon with less than 35 percent clay and lack an E horizon.  Chubbs, Mikesell, and McVickers soils lack albic horizons that tongue into the argillic horizon and have dominantly montmorillonitic clay.  Lubrecht and Maukey soils are dominated by mixed mineralogy.  Soldier, Bead, Wetterhorn and Cluff soils are dominated by montmorillonitic clay."

Slope gradients are 2 to 12 percent.  The soils formed in shale or soft limestone.  The mean average annual precipitation is 20 to 25 inches and the freeze-free period ranges from 60 to 65 days.  The mean annual temperature is 36 to 42 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 53 to 57 degrees F."
