    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to rippable reddish sandstone and reddish sandy shale rock ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  Depth to hard rock ranges from 20 to more than 60 inches.  Most of the soil has soft fragments of decalcified reddish quartzose limestone and calcareous sandstone and shale throughout. Channers and gravel range from 5 to 15 percent in the A horizon, from 10 to 25 percent in the Bw/Bt horizon, and from 5 to more than 50 percent in the C horizon where present.  The soil is very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw/Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.\nSome pedons have a C horizon with colors and textures similar to the Bw horizon.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction also includes clay, and sandy clay."
