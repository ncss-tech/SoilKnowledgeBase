  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of soil development is 40 to more than 80 inches. Loess thickness is greater than 80 inches. The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay. The ratio of coarse silt to fine silt is 1.5 or greater. The series control section averages less than 7 percent sand coarser than very fine. Carbonates are below a depth of 60 inches in some pedons.\nThe Ap or A horizon has value of 3 to 5 (5 or 7 dry) and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is silt loam or silt. Clay content is 8 to 22 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 to 6 (6 to 8 dry) and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silt loam or silt. Clay content is 8 to 22 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid. The E horizon is incorporated into the Ap horizon in some pedons.\nSome pedons have an EB or a BE horizon.\nThe Bt and BC horizons have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, and 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture typically is silt loam but is silty clay loam in some thin subhorizons. Clay content averages 18 to 27 percent but ranges to 30 percent in thin subhorizons in some pedons. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe lower part of the control section (C) has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is silt loam or silt. Clay content is 10 to 24 percent. Reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline."

Baraboo, Dubuque, La Farge and Palsgrove  soils are moderately deep or deep to a lithic or paralithic contact. Bertrand, Fayette, Martinsburg, Pepin, Seaton, and Yellowriver soils are in areas that have a mean annual soil temperature less than 56 degrees F. Blackhammer, Camden, Flagg, Greenridge, Jackson, Lambeau, Middletown, Piscasaw, Ridgway, Rush, Russell, St. Charles and Thebes soils have 2B horizons with more than 7 percent fine sand or coarser.  Dodge, Navlys and Sylvan soils contain carbonates above a depth of 60 inches. Hackers soils have hues of 2.5YR or 5YR dominant in the solum and throughout the substratum. Jemerson soils contain more sand in all parts of the series control section. Menfro, Palermo, Rozetta and Ruma soils average more than 27 percent clay in all parts of the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Stookey soils are on gently  sloping to very steep convex slopes on the bluffs along the Mississippi River Valley. Slope ranges from 2 to 70 percent. These soils formed in thick coarse loess. Mean annual temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 36 to 44 inches, frost-free period is 180 to 210 days, and elevation is 350 to 800 feet above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Drury, Hamburg, and Menfro soils. The well drained Drury soils are on footslopes below the Stookey soils. The somewhat excessively drained Hamburg soils formed in calcareous loess and are typically nearer to the bluff escarpment. The well drained Menfro soils are in a fine-silty family and are on summits and shoulders above the Stookey soils."

At that time the Stookey soils were included with the Seaton series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 6 inches (A and E horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from approximately 6 to 53 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons).\nUdic moisture regime.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data for several pedons in Illinois are on file at the NRCS/USDA state office in Champaign, Illinois.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
