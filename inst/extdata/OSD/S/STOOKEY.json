The series control section averages less than 7 percent sand coarser than very fine. Carbonates are below a depth of 60 inches in some pedons.\nThe Ap or A horizon has value of 3 to 5 (5 or 7 dry) and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is silt loam or silt. Clay content is 8 to 22 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 to 6 (6 to 8 dry) and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silt loam or silt. Clay content is 8 to 22 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid. The E horizon is incorporated into the Ap horizon in some pedons.\nSome pedons have an EB or a BE horizon.\nThe Bt and BC horizons have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, and 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture typically is silt loam but is silty clay loam in some thin subhorizons. Clay content averages 18 to 27 percent but ranges to 30 percent in thin subhorizons in some pedons. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe lower part of the control section (C) has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is silt loam or silt. Clay content is 10 to 24 percent. Reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline."

Blackhammer, Camden, Flagg, Greenridge, Jackson, Lambeau, Middletown, Piscasaw, Ridgway, Rush, Russell, St. Charles and Thebes soils have 2B horizons with more than 7 percent fine sand or coarser.  Dodge, Navlys and Sylvan soils contain carbonates above a depth of 60 inches. Hackers soils have hues of 2.5YR or 5YR dominant in the solum and throughout the substratum. Jemerson soils contain more sand in all parts of the series control section.
