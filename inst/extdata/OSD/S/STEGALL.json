  "OVERVIEW": "The Stegall series consist of soils that are moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon.  They are well drained and moderately slowly permeable above a very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon.  These soils formed in loamy eolian sediments over a layer of indurated caliche which is underlain by loamy calcareous material derived from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age.  They are on broad, smooth, nearly level to very gently sloping plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 457 mm (18 in) and the mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
