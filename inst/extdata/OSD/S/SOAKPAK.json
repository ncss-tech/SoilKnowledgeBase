  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum ranges from 10 to 15 inches in thickness. Coarse fragments are rounded and make up 10 to 35 percent of the soil mass in the upper part of the profile, and 35 to 60 percent below the 10 inch depth. The soil temperature is always below 0 degrees C at a depth of 20 inches but ice crystals are usually absent because of low moisture. A few frost scars may occur on the surface. Colors in the B horizon have hues of 7.5YR or 10YR, a value of 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. The texture of the B horizon ranges from gravelly sandy loam to gravelly silt loam. The C horizon has colors in hues of 10YR to 5Y, values of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. The texture of the C horizon ranges from very gravelly sandy loam to very gravelly loam."

The Anaktuvuk soils are formed in very gravelly and sandy gray alluvium on nearly level floodplains. The Kollutuk soils are mottled and have a patterned surface. The Umiat soils are gleyed and mottled silt loams with thick 0 horizons."
