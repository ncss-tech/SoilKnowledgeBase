  "OVERVIEW": "The Sherdahl series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on risers and treads of stream terraces in river valleys of the Central Kansas Sandstone Hills in MLRA 74. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 750 millimeters (30 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F)",

These could be caused by irrigation. The majority of these areas are irrigated and treated like well drained soils instead of moderately well drained soils. It was decided to call them well drained because of that.\nUsually the buried paleosol is similar to a Muir soil, but sometimes it is similar to a Detroit soil.\nKeys to soil Taxonomy: Eleventh edition, 2010\nThis soil was set up to take the place of the Eudora series that was mapped in the terrace position of the Republican River, in north central Kansas."
