    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nThe diagnostic horizons and characteristics recognized in this soil are:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 29 centimeters (0 to 12 inches) (Ap and A horizons)\nSecondary Carbonates: 104 to 200 centimeters (42 to 80 inches) (2Bkb1, 2Bkb2, 2Bkb3 and 2Bkb4 horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity: At the upper boundary of the 2Ab horizon; 84 centimeters (34 inches)\nThere has been discussion of whether these soils are well drained or moderately well drained, because redoximorphic concentrations can be found within 100 centimeters. These could be caused by irrigation. The majority of these areas are irrigated and treated like well drained soils instead of moderately well drained soils. It was decided to call them well drained because of that.\nUsually the buried paleosol is similar to a Muir soil, but sometimes it is similar to a Detroit soil.\nKeys to soil Taxonomy: Eleventh edition, 2010\nThis soil was set up to take the place of the Eudora series that was mapped in the terrace position of the Republican River, in north central Kansas.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nData for typical pedon is from Kansas State University Laboratory; pedon 09KS1571047. Addition laboratory data- National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE pedon number S09KS157002 and Kansas State University Laboratory, Manhattan, Kansas; pedon 10KS029504, 10KS157001.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
