  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and the depth to bedrock are 20 to 40 inches.  Granite boulders, stones and cobbles are prevalent and occupy from 3 to l5 percent of the land surface.  The gravel content by volume of the A horizon and Bt horizon ranges from 0 to l0 percent and the gravel content of the 2Bt and 2BC horizons ranges from 5 to 30 percent. Approximately 60 percent of the coarse fragments smaller than 3 inches in diameter is less than l/4 inch in size.\nThe A horizon has hue of l0YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The E horizon has hue of l0YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  The texture of the A and E horizons is silt loam or loam and commonly is very bouldery or very stony on the surface. Reaction is slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of l0YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam, and is strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe 2Bt and 2BC horizons have hue of l0YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, loam or their gravelly analogues.  Reaction is very strongly acid or extremely acid.\nA 2Cr horizon is present in some places with 5YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 3 to 8 and chroma of 4 or 5.  It is compact and hard with coarse platy strata."

Pigeonroost soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. The rest of these soils except Quakertown and Whiteford have solum thickness or depth to bedrock or both that are greater than 40 inches. Quakertown soils have formed in residuum weathered from fine grained sandstone, sandy siltstone, and thin bedded argillite.  Whiteford soils have coarse fragments of black or nearly black, very hard slate in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Syenite soils are strongly sloping to steep soils on mountain sides.  Slopes range from 8 to 35 percent.  The soils formed in residuum from granite and possibly a thin loess deposit.  Boulders and stones are characteristics of the series.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 55 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Irondale, Delassus and Loughboro soils.  Irondale soils formed in very stony residuum from felsite rock and occur on foot slopes at higher elevations.  Delassus soils have fragipans and formed in loess and the underlying residuum from granite.  Loughboro soils are deep, poorly drained upland soils. Delassus and Loughboro soils occur on smooth to undulating ridges and divides."
