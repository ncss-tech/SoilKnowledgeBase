  "OVERVIEW": "The Southridge series consists of well drained soils that formed in a mantle of loess and in the thick clayey pedisediment or residuum from dolomite on summits or upper side slopes of dissected uplands.  These soils have moderate permeability in the upper part and slow permeability in the lower part.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to free carbonates ranges from 60 to 100 inches or more.  Thickness of loess is typically 20 to 36 inches but ranges from 15 to 40 inches.  Depth to dolomite bedrock is typically 60 to 90 inches but may range to 120 inches or more.  The content of chert and dolomite fragments is 5 to 25 percent in the 2Bt horizon.  Fragments are dominantly cherty.\nThe Ap horizon and in uncultivated areas the A and E horizons, where mixed to a depth of 7 inches, have value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or more dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A and E horizons typically are silt loam but they are silt in a few pedons.  It typically is slightly acid or medium acid but the Ap horizon in some pedons is neutral.\nThe B horizon in the loess has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4 chroma.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam averaging 18 to 30 percent clay.  It is very strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe 2B horizon typically has 5YR hue but the range includes 2.5YR and 7.5YR.  It has value and chroma range of 4 through 6.  It averages 55 to 80 percent clay and exceeds by 25 percent (absolute) the average clay content of the B horizon in the loess.  It is firm or very firm.  It is very strongly acid through medium acid."

Baylis soils lack contrasting textures and have more coarse fragments in the lower part of the solum.  Fayette soils lack contrasting textures.  NewGlarus soils have bedrock within depths of 40 inches.  Palsgrove soils formed in thicker loess and have bedrock within depths of 60 inches.  Rollingstone and Wildale soils formed in a thinner loess mantle.  Seaton soils lack contrasting textures.  Valton soils have a thin dark colored surface layer."
