    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to bedrock ranges from 15 to 20 inches.  Depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 6 to 10 inches.  The particle-size control section ranges from 10 to 18 percent clay and 35 to 75 percent rock fragments which are mostly cobbles.\nAverage annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The soil moisture regime is Aridic bordering on Xeric.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Rock fragment content is 35 to 60 percent of which 20 to 35 percent are cobbles and 15 to 30 percent are pebbles.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 5 to 15 percent and reaction is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Rock fragment content is 35 to 65 percent of which 20 to 35 percent are cobbles and 15 to 30 percent are pebbles.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 5 to 15 percent and reaction is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline.  The base of this horizon is less than 10 inches and is not deep enough to met the criteria for a cambic horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is very cobbly loam or extremely cobbly loam.   Rock fragment content is 35 to 75 percent of which 25 to 65 percent are cobbles and 10 to 30 percent are pebbles.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 20 to 40 percent and is disseminated, in soft masses and in coatings on rock fragments."

Samor soils have a thin calcium carbonate cemented pan above the bedrock.  Saxby soils have a cambic horizon.  Tarnach soils are 18 to 27 percent clay and are dominated by pebbles in the particle-size control section."
