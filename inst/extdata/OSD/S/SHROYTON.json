The mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The solum contains 50 to 80 percent volcanic glass and glass-coated aggregates, phosphate retention is 40 to 70 percent, acid oxalate aluminum plus one half the iron is 0.40 to 0.80 percent and 15-bar water content on dried and undried samples is 5 to 12 percent.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  Reaction is neutral throughout.\nThe Oi horizon is 1 to 3 inches thick except where disturbed.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It contains 0 to 10 percent gravel and 25 to 40 percent sand-size pumice (0.5-2.0 millimeters).  Base saturation is assumed to be 50 to 80 percent.  Organic matter content is 1 to 4 percent.  Field estimated clay content is 2 to 6 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3, 4 or 6 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It is gravelly ashy sandy loam or gravelly ashy coarse sandy loam.  It contains 15 to 30 percent gravels and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Total rock fragment content is 15 to 35 percent.  It contains 30 to 60 percent sand-size pumice (0.5-2.0 millimeters).  Field estimated clay content is 5 to 10 percent.\nA gravelly ashy loamy sand or ashy sandy loam C horizon may be present in some pedons."
