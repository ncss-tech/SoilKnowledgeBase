  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Symerton soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping till plains or glacial lake plains of Wisconsinan Age. They formed in loamy outwash and in the underlying till or lacustrine sediments. They have as much as 61 cm (24 inches) of loess or other silty material on the surface of many pedons. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 8 to 12 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from about 740 to 1020 mm (29 to 40 inches), frost-free period ranges from 160 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 155 to 311 meters (510 to 1020 feet) above sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Andres, Elliott, and Lisbon soils are slightly lower on the landscape than Symerton soils. The poorly drained Ashkum soils are on low-lying parts of the landscape and in upland drainageways and contain more clay in the particle-size control section. Varna soils are nearby on similar slopes, but have more clay in the control section."

A perched seasonal high water table is at a depth of 61 to 107 cm (2 to 3.5 feet) at some time between February and April in most years. The potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) in the loess and loamy outwash, and moderately high or moderately low (0.42 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the till or lacustrine sediments. Permeability is moderate in the loess and loamy outwash, and moderately slow or slow in the till or lacustrine sediments."
