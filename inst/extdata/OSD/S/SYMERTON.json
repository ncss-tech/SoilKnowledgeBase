  "STATES": "IL,IN,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Symerton series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in a thin mantle of loess, loamy outwash, and in the underlying till or lacustrine sediments. They are on till plains or former glacial lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",

The somewhat poorly drained Andres, Elliott, and Lisbon soils are slightly lower on the landscape than Symerton soils. The poorly drained Ashkum soils are on low-lying parts of the landscape and in upland drainageways and contain more clay in the particle-size control section. Varna soils are nearby on similar slopes, but have more clay in the control section."

A perched seasonal high water table is at a depth of 61 to 107 cm (2 to 3.5 feet) at some time between February and April in most years. The potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) in the loess and loamy outwash, and moderately high or moderately low (0.42 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the till or lacustrine sediments.
