  "OVERVIEW": "The Samba series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in old alluvium and pedisediments.  These level to depressional soils are in upland valleys along the north escarpment of the Boston Mountains; MLRA 117.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.",

Texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1; or hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2, Redoximorphic accumulations are in shades brown or red.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1; or hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2, Redoximorphic accumulations are in shades brown or red.  Texture of the fine earth is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay.  Some pedons are stratified clay, silty clay, and gravel.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 25 percent."

Summit soils are better drained and have a mollic epipedon."
