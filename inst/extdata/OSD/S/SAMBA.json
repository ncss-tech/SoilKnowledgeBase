Reaction is slightly acid or moderately acid in the A horizon and ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the B and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1; or hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2, Redoximorphic accumulations are in shades brown or red.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1; or hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2, Redoximorphic accumulations are in shades brown or red.  Texture of the fine earth is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay.  Some pedons are stratified clay, silty clay, and gravel.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 25 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include Cherokee, Johnsburg and Summit series.  Cherokee soils do not have an umbric epipedon and have an abrupt texture change between the ochric epipedon and underly ing argillic horizon.  Johnsburg soils have fragipans.  Summit soils are better drained and have a mollic epipedon."
