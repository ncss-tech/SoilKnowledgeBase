  "REVDATE": "06/2005",
  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Skelridge series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and/or residuum derived from sedimentary rock. Skelridge soils are on backslopes and shoulders of hills. Slopes range from 10 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
