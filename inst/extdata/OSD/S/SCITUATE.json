  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The loamy mantle is 18 through 34 inches (46 through 90 centimeters) thick and corresponds closely the depth to the dense substratum. Rock fragments are dominantly granite and gneiss. Gravel content ranges from 5 through 25 percent by volume in the solum and from 10 through 35 percent in the 2Cd horizon. Cobbles range from 0 through 15 percent throughout. The surface horizon has 0 through 20 percent stones and the B and 2C horizons have 0 through 10 percent stones. Boulders range from 0 through 5 percent throughout. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid in the surface horizon and from very strongly acid through moderately acid in the subsoil and substratum.\nSome pedons have an O horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. In cultivated areas the Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 4. Dry value of the Ap horizon is 6 or more. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons have an incipient E horizon immediately below the A horizon.\nThe upper part of the Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 6. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe lower part of the Bw horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value and chroma of 4 through 6. Redox features are few through many and are distinct or prominent. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have a thin BC horizon that ranges from loamy sand through sandy loam. Color range is the same as the lower part of the Bw horizon but the range includes value of 7 in some pedons.\nThe 2Cd horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. Redox features are common or many, medium and coarse, and are distinct or prominent. Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons have subhorizons of sandy loam or fine sandy loam below a depth of 40 inches. Consistence is firm or very firm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Amostown, Bernardston, Broadbrook, Horseneck, Nantucket, Paxton, and Wethersfield series. Amostown soils formed in lacustrine sediments that are silt or very fine sand the lower solum and substratum. Bernardston and Broadbrook soils have sola with more than 65 percent silt plus very fine sand. Horseneck soils are formed in glaciofluvial deposits. Paxton soils are well drained and have loamy substrata. Nantucket soils have a lithologic discontinuity and have loamy substrata. Wethersfield soils have 5YR or redder hue in the B and C horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Scituate soils are nearly level through moderately steep and are on glaciated uplands. Slope ranges from 0 through 25 percent. The soils are on nearly level to gently sloping tops of broad ridges and drumlins, and on gently sloping to moderately steep foot slopes and toe slopes. They formed in eolian influenced Wisconsin age loamy till underlain by dense sandy lodgement till. The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 through 50 degrees F. (7 through 10 degrees C.) The mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 through 45 inches (1016 through 1143 millimeters). The frost free season ranges from 100 through 120 days."

Deerfield, Hinckley, Merrimac, Scarboro, Sudbury, Walpole, and Wareham soils are on nearby glacial outwash plains, kames, deltas, and eskers. Hollis, Paxton, and Woodbridge soils are on nearby loamy glacial till uplands."
