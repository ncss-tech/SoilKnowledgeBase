  "OVERVIEW": "The Sandoval series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium from sandstone and shale and residuum derived from shale.  Sandoval soils are on ridges, hills, and escarpments.  Slopes range from 1 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
