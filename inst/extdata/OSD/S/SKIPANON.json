The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F. The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures is 5 to 9 degrees F under canopy cover. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches.  Andic soil properties, when present, do not extend below 14 inches.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches and in some areas more than 60 inches.  Rock fragments are angular and subangular in shape and are derived from colluvial origin.  It is extremely to very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is medial silt loam with 18 to 25 percent field estimated clay. It has 15 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent paragravel. It has a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 1.0 g/cubic centimeter, and acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 3.0 percent.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Condorbridge, Grassyknob, Horseprairie, Reedsport, and Svensen series. Condorbridge soils are greater than 60 inches deep, do not have Oi horizons, and rock fragments, when present, are rounded or subrounded and derived from alluvial origin.  Grassyknob and Reedsport soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Horseprairie soils are more than 60 inches deep to bedrock and have an umbric epipedon 20 to 40 inches thick. Svensen soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section, more than 15 percent particles greater than 0.1 mm diameter, and do not have pararock fragments in the lower part of the cambic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Skipanon soils are on old massive landslide areas of coastal hills and mountains at elevations of 40 to 1,500 feet.  Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent.  The soil formed in old mass movement deposits derived from igneous and sedimentary rock overlying sedimentary rock.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers.  Low clouds and fog during the summer reduce evapotranspiration and moderate temperatures. The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 110 inches. The mean annual temperature is 44 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 110 to 210 days."

Ecola soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock and fine-silty family. Templeton soils are in the fine-silty family. Necanicum soils are medial-skeletal. These soils are on ridgetops and side slopes of hills and mountains."

If accepted, medial modifiers would be used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not always meeting andic soil properties.\nDepth to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
