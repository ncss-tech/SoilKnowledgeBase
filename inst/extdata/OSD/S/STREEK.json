  "OVERVIEW": "The Streek series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in a thin mantle of mixed alluvium over silty and clayey alluvium. They are on hillslopes, mountain slopes, summits, alluvial fans and fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
