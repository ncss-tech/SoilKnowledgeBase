  "OVERVIEW": "The Streek series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in a thin mantle of mixed alluvium over silty and clayey alluvium. They are on hillslopes, mountain slopes, summits, alluvial fans and fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Cleymor soils have a 20 to more than 60 inch thick mollic epipedon and are formed from volcaniclastic materials. Laplatta soils have a 24 to 40 inch thick mollic epipedon. Mondey soils have secondary carbonates at 31 inches and are formed in materials weathered from sandstone.  Shar soils are moderately deep to bedrock and are formed in alluvium and loess over basalt.  Top soils do not have slickensides.  Wickiser soils have a mollic epipedon 25 to 35 inches thick."
