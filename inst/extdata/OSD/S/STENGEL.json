  "REVDATE": "04/2009",
  "STATES": "WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Stengel series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in a mantle of sandy outwash or lacustrine deposits and in clayey lacustrine deposits and underlain by sandy outwash or sandy lacustrine deposits on glacial lake plains. Permeability is rapid in the sandy mantle, slow or very slow in the clayey deposits, and rapid in the underlying sandy outwash.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the sandy mantle, from extremely acid to slightly alkaline in the clayey deposits and from very strongly acid to neutral in the outwash.  Content of gravel ranges from 0 to 12 percent in the sandy mantle and from 0 to 1 percent in the clayey lacustrine deposits and 0 to 5 percent in the sandy substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have an Ap horizon 6 to 9 inches thick, with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loamy sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is sand or loamy sand.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  Clay content ranges from 60 to 80 percent.  Thin subhorizons with less than 60 percent clay occur in some pedons. Redox features with chroma of 2 or less are always in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.\nSome pedons have 2Btg horizons which have hue and value like the 2Bt, but have chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 8.  It is sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand."
