  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches or more. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Gravel and cobbles range from 0 to 35 percent in the A, Ap, and Bw horizons and from 0 to 80 percent in the C horizon. Some pedons contain few to common flakes of mica. Reaction ranges from slightly acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6. In some pedons, the upper Bw horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 2 through 4. It is loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, or  clay loam in the fine-earth fraction and is often stratified."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bellevue, Boonesboro, and Rossburg series. Bellevue soils have gray Fe depletions in the Bw horizon and are developed in stratified alluvium derived from clayey till and clayey lacustrine soils. Bellevue soils also have lower mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature. Boonesboro soils have a lithic contact within depths of 20 to 40 inches. Rossburg soils formed in alluvium from glacial drift and have glacial erratic rock fragments throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Speedwell soils are on flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. They formed in alluvium derived from limestones, sandstones, siltstones, phyllites, shales, gneiss, granites, schists, and basalts of Precambrian and Cambrian ages. In Virginia, Speedwell soils are on flood plains along Cripple Creek, the Middle and South Forks of the Holston River, and the New River. Speedwell soils are also on flood plains of the portions of the Maury and Shenandoah Rivers that drain areas underlain by rocks of the above lithologies and ages.  Climate is temperate and humid. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 53 to 56 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 45 inches."

Austinville, Chester, Glenelg, Groseclose, Myersville, and Shottower soils have argillic horizons and are on uplands. Catoctin, Chiswell, and Sylvatus soils contain more rock fragments in the control section, have bedrock within 40 inches, and are on uplands. Vesuvius soils contain less clay and are on similar landscapes."
