The mean summer soil temperature is 60 to 62 degrees F.\nThe Al horizon has hue of lOYR, 2.5Y, or 5Y and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 dry, and 4 to 7 moist. It is predominantly cobbly or gravelly clay loam, or very cobbly clay loam, but ranges to include thin layers of cobbly loam, cobbly silty silty clay loam, stony clay loam, very stony silty clay loam, or silty clay loam.  It typically has 15 to 25 percent gravel and 5 to 25 percent cobbles and channers but averages 20 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section."
