  "OVERVIEW": "The Sunsetcrater series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in coarse tephra deposited over clayey tephra derived from volcanic rock. Sunsetcrater soils are on cinder cones and lava fields. Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches (457 millimeters) and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F. (6.7 degrees Celcius)",
