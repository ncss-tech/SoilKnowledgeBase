  "OVERVIEW": "The Southside series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy and/or gravelly alluvial sediments of Pleistocene age. These very gently sloping to moderately steep soils occur on risers of stream terraces on plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 20 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 16.1 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in).",
