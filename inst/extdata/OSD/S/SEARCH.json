  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to paralithic contact typically ranges from 20 to 30 inches, but can be as deep as 40 inches in some areas. Solum thickness ranges from 9 to 13 inches. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the surface horizons and from 10 to 35 percent in the subsoil and substratum. Soft shale channers range from 0 to 15 percent throughout the profile. The channers will slake down in overnight shaking in calgon solution. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 40 to 70 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 0 to 2. It is very fine sandy loam, silt loam or loam. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe B part of the B/A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. The A part of the B/A horizon has colors similar to the A horizon. Textures of the B/A horizon are the same as for the A horizon. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. They are the very gravelly analogs of very fine sandy loam or silt loam. Thin subhorizons, less than 6 inches thick, of gravelly very fine sandy loam or gravelly silt loam are allowed. It is moderately alkaline."
