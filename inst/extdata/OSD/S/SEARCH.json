  "OVERVIEW": "The Search series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy glacial till overlying calcareous, soft shale bedrock on ground and end moraines. Permeability is moderately slow. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to paralithic contact typically ranges from 20 to 30 inches, but can be as deep as 40 inches in some areas. Solum thickness ranges from 9 to 13 inches. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the surface horizons and from 10 to 35 percent in the subsoil and substratum. Soft shale channers range from 0 to 15 percent throughout the profile. The channers will slake down in overnight shaking in calgon solution. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 40 to 70 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 0 to 2. It is very fine sandy loam, silt loam or loam. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe B part of the B/A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. The A part of the B/A horizon has colors similar to the A horizon. Textures of the B/A horizon are the same as for the A horizon. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. They are the very gravelly analogs of very fine sandy loam or silt loam. Thin subhorizons, less than 6 inches thick, of gravelly very fine sandy loam or gravelly silt loam are allowed. It is moderately alkaline."
