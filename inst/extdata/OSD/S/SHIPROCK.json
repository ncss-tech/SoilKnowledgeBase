Brinkerhoff soils have a layer containing gypsum within 40 inches. Chacoan soils are moderately deep over sandstone. Enos soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Delp soils have argillic horizons composed of lamellae in some part. Glotrain soils have 10YR hue. Granshaw soils have stratified sand and gravel horizons in the lower part of the profile.  Mayqueen soils have sandy textures within 20 inches of the surface.  Wallson soils have temperatures less than 52 degrees F.  Woolsey soils have a calcareous solum.  Additionally, Enos and Wallson soils receive most of their precipitation in the spring and Delp, Glotrain, Granshaw, and Woolsey soils receive most of their precipitation in the winter."

Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 4800 to 6,800 feet. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 5 to 10 inches. The frost free period is 130 to 160 days."
