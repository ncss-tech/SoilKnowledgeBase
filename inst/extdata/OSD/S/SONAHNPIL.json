  "OVERVIEW": "The Sonahnpil series consists of very deep, well drained soils on flood plains and alluvial fans. These soils formed in alluvium derived from basic volcanic lava. Slope is 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual rainfall is about 4,699 millimeters (185 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 27 degrees C. (81 degrees F.).",
