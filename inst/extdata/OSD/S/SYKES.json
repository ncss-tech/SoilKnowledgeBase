This soil is slightly acid to strongly acid except the layer just above bedrock ranges to mildly alkaline.  Gravel and angular fragments of chert range from none to about 15 percent in each horizon.  Depth to the 2Bt horizon ranges from 24 to 48 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Pedons with value of 3 are less than 7 inches thick or have chroma of 4.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 or 6.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8.

The upper part is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam and the lower part is clay or silty clay.\nThe 2C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 to 6.  Mottles are in shades of brown, red, and gray and some pedons  are an evenly mottled pattern without a dominant matrix color.  Texture is clay or silty clay."

Atwood and Lexington soils have 2Bt horizons that are loamy instead of clayey.  Armour soils do not have a clayey 2Bt horizon within 48 inches.  Crider soils are on uplands, typically have redder colors and are mesic.  Dellrose soils are on hillsides and are fine-loamy.  Harpeth soils are on uplands and high stream terraces have redder colors and do not have slowly to very slowly permeable subsoils within 36 inches.  Hicks soils are on upland ridgetops and have soft bedrock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Stiversville soils are on uplands, are fine-loamy, and have soft bedrock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches."
