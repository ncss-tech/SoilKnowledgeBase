  "OVERVIEW": "The Skeel series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy outwash and the underlying loamy lacustrine deposits on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
