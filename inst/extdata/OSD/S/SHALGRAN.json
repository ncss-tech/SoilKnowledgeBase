    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shalgran soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rock.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 8,000 to 9,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 55 inches, mean annual temperature is 36 to 39 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
