  "OVERVIEW": "The Splawn series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on hills and lava plateaus.  They formed in material weathered dominantly from basalt.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.  and mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches.",
