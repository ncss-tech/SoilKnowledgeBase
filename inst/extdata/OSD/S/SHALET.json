  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to shale bedrock ranges from 4 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 54 to 59 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 72 to 78 degrees F.  The soils are dry in the moisture control section 75 to 90 percent of the time that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is more than 41 degrees F.  Few to common fine crystals of gypsum (0.05 to 2.0 mm diameter) occur in some pedons.  Pebble content ranges from 0 to 20 percent in the particle-size control section and in many areas a desert pavement of pebble covers up to 20 percent of the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR and chroma of 4 to 6.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5YR, value of 3 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It ranges from clay loam, loam or sandy clay loam and contains shale fragments in some pedons."

Birdsley soils are very strongly alkaline and have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium.  Celeton, Goldyke, Oceanet, Persayo, Roic and Slatery soils have hue yellower than 10YR.  All these soils except Roic lack gypsum.  Roic soils contain less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent, commonly sideslopes into drainageways range from 5 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in residuum from shale.  Mean annual air temperature is 51 to 58 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 76 to 69 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 5 to 13 inches.  The freeze-free period ranges from 165 to 175 days."
