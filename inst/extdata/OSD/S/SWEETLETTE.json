  "STATUS": "Tentative Series",
  "BYREV": "DPG/DJP/CBR",
  "REVDATE": "05/2020",
  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sweetlette series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum weathered from sandstone and shale.  These soils are on cuestas, escarpments, hillslopes, and structural benches. Slopes are 1 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 205 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.",
