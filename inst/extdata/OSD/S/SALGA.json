Distinct calcic horizons are at\ndepths of 22 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon is dark brown to very dark grayish brown in\nhue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.\nIt is clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt1 horizon has the same range in color as the A\nhorizon.  The Bt2 horizon is reddish brown or brown in hue\nor 5YR or 7.5YR, value or 4 or 5 and chroma of 4.  It is\nclay loam or clay.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 45\npercent.  The Bt horizon contains 6 to 14 percent more clay\nthan the A horizon.\nThe Btk horizon is reddish yellow or yellowish red in hue of\n5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 6.  It contains\n40 to 70 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the upper\npart and 20 to 40 percent in the lower part."

LaCasa soils have sola thinner than 60\ninches.  Nuvalde soils lack an argillic horizon.  Olton\nsoils are dry for longer periods of time.

Apparently, these soils\ndeveloped an argillic horizon under an earlier climatic age\nand have since been recalcified.  They were formerly\nincluded in the Nuvalde series.  Diagnostic horizons and\nfeatures recognized in this pedon are:  Mollic epipedon - 0\nto 16 inches, Argillic horizon - 6 to 84 inches, Calcic\nhorizon - 25 to 84 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
