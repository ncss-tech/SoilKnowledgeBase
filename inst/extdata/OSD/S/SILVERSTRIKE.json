  "OVERVIEW": "The Silverstrike series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone and siltstone.  Silverstrike soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
