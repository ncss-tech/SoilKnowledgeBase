Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2. Texture is sandy loam, loamy sand, or sand. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2.5 or 3, and chroma of 3. Texture is sandy loam, loamy sand, or sand. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is loamy sand or sand, but the Bs1 horizon ranges to sandy loam. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon, or 2Bw horizon in some pedons, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is loamy sand or sand or their gravelly analogs. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a Bx, E/Bx, B/Ex, Bt, or 2Bt horizon just above the densic contact with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 4. Texture is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand. These horizons are either less than 6 inches thick combined, or the clay increase is less than 3 percent absolute from adjacent horizons, or the structure and consistency is not consolidated enough to be root restrictive. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly to slightly acid.\nThe 2BCd horizon has hue of 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 3 or 4.

The moderately well drained Stanberry (T) soils are on similar landscape positions, and the somewhat poorly drained Parkfalls (T) and poorly drained Wozny soils are in depressions and drainageways. These soils have a loamy mantle over the dense sandy till. The moderately well drained Annalake and Cublake soils are on associated small glacial lake plains. The well drained Keweenaw soils are on more sloping landscape positions where the till is not densic. The excessively drained Rubicon, Sayner, and Vilas soils; the somewhat excessively Lindquist and Pence soils; and the well drained Padus soils are on associated outwash plains."
