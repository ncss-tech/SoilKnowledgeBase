  "OVERVIEW": "The Sarilda series consists of moderately deep well drained soils that formed in loess on basalt or rhyolite plains.  Slopes are 1 to 6 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",
