  "OVERVIEW": "The Secondset series consist of moderately deep, well drained moderately permeable soils that formed in mixed materials from eolian deposits, limestone, sandstone, basalt, and quartzite.  These soils are on high plateaus or mesa tops and flat mountain tops and have slopes of 0 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 810 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 2 degrees C.",

Karlan and Lespate soils have consistent k horizons.  Winevada soils have moisture control sections that are dry for longer cumulative periods following the summer solstice.  Hackwood and Taterheap soils are very deep.  Idmon soils lack bedrock above a depth of 100 cm.  Strickland soils have evidence of clay movement."
