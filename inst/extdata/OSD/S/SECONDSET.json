Rock fragments range from 0 to 30 percent with pebbles dominant.  The solum is moderately acid through neutral.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The moisture control section is moist in some or all parts in the period between the winter and summer solstice when the soil is not frozen and is moist in some parts of the moisture control section following the summer solstice for 60 to 90 cumulative days.\nThe O horizon is not present in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.

Adel, Bullbasin, Bullrey, Duff,  Gallatin, Lamphier, Leavittville, Mundos, Osmund, Pavohroo, and Rhone soils lack bedrock above depths of 40 inches.  Karlan and Lespate soils have consistent k horizons.  Winevada soils have moisture control sections that are dry for longer cumulative periods following the summer solstice.  Hackwood and Taterheap soils are very deep.  Idmon soils lack bedrock above a depth of 40 inches.  Strickland soils have evidence of clay movement."
