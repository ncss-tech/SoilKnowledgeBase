  "REVDATE": "12/2008",
  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Stozuni series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian material and alluvium and slope alluvium derived from sandstone. Stozuni soils are on mesas, cuestas, and hills. Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
