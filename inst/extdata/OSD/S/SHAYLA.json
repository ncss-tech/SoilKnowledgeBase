  "OVERVIEW": "The Shayla series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuffs, siltstone or welded tuffs.  Shayla soils are on rock core areas of hills and fan piedmont remnant side slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
