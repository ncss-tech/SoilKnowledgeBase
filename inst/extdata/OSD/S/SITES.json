    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sites soils occur on summits and backslopes of mountain slopes with slope gradients of 2 to 75 percent at elevations of 500 to 1200 meters. They formed in material weathered from metabasic and metasedimentary rocks. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 890 mm to 1825 mm, of which 1 to 10 percent occurs as snow. Mean annual air temperature is 10 to 14 degrees C, average January temperature about 4 degrees C, and average July temperature about 22 degrees C. The frost-free season is about 185 to 265 days."

Mariposa soils have a lithic contact with metasedimentary rock at a depth of 50 to 100 cm. Boomer, Holland, Horseshoe, Jocal and Musick soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section. Horseshoe soils occur on lahars and Tertiary-age terrace remnants. Jocal and Mariposa, like Sites, occur on metasedimentary rocks. Holland and Musick formed from intrusive igneous rocks."
