  "OVERVIEW": "The Sudbury series consists of very deep, moderately well and somewhat poorly drained soils on outwash plains. They are nearly level through strongly sloping soils in slight depressions and on terraces and foot slopes in areas of outwash or glaciofluvial deposits. Slope ranges from 0 through 15 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the upper solum and high or very high in the lower solum and substratum. Mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F. (9 degrees C.) and the mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches (1092 millimeters).",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to stratified sand and gravel range from 18 through 36 inches (46 through 91 centimeters). Depth to redoximorphic features ranges from 12 through 24 inches (30 through 60 centimeters) and must include redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less. Rock fragment content of individual horizons of the solum ranges from 0 through 30 percent by volume. The fragments are primarily fine gravel but include some medium gravel, coarse gravel and cobbles. Rock fragment content of the C horizon ranges from 0 through 75 percent, and consists of 0 through 65 percent gravel and 0 through 25 percent cobbles and stones. The fragments are mainly granite or gneiss with less than 25 percent dark, fine-grained shale, slate, or phyllite. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through slightly acid in the solum, unless limed, and from very strongly acid through slightly acid in the substratum.\nSome pedons have an O horizon.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 0 through 4. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is granular or subangular blocky.\nSome pedons have an E horizon that has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. The E horizon has the same texture range as the A horizon. Structure is granular or subangular blocky.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 8. The upper part of the B horizon is fine sandy loam or sandy loam and the lower part ranges from sandy loam through coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is granular or subangular blocky or the horizon is massive.  The structure may be single grain in the lower part in some pedons.\nThe 2CB horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 8. Texture ranges from loamy sand through coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 8. It consists of stratified sand, gravel, and cobbles and ranges from loamy fine sand through coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.\nThe Deerfield, Merrimac, Ninigret, Tisbury, and Walpole series are in related families. Deerfield soils have loamy fine sand or coarser textures below a depth of 10 inches (25 centimeters). Merrimac soils are somewhat excessively drained. Ninigret soils are coarse loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal. Tisbury soils are silt loam or very fine sandy loam in the upper part of the B horizon. Walpole soils are poorly drained."

Slope ranges from 0 through 15 percent. The soils formed in water sorted sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial materials derived mainly from granite, gneiss, and schist. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 through 55 inches (762 through 1397 millimeters) and mean annual temperature ranges from 45 through 50 degrees F. (7 through 10 degrees C.). Mean growing season ranges from 120 through 240 days."

Agawam, Hinckley, Merrimac, and Windsor soils do not have redox depletions within 24 inches (60 centimeters) of the surface. In addition, the Hinckley and Windsor soils have loamy sand or coarser textures in the B horizon. Deerfield soils have loamy fine sand or coarser textures below a depth of 10 inches (25 centimeters).
