  "OVERVIEW": "The Squashan series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated tectonically uplifted fluvial and beach deposits derived from mixed sources. Squashan soils are on mountains and hills and have slopes of 9 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2030 millimeters (80 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from older, weakly consolidated tectonically uplifted fluvial and beach deposits derived from mixed sources. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1520 to 2290 millimeters (60 to 90 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is 240 to 325 days."
