  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Squashan soils occur on ridges and mountain slopes and sideslopes of hills. Slopes are 9 to 50 percent. Elevations are 6 to 593 meters (20 to 1950 feet). The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from older, weakly consolidated tectonically uplifted fluvial and beach deposits derived from mixed sources. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1520 to 2290 millimeters (60 to 90 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is 240 to 325 days."
