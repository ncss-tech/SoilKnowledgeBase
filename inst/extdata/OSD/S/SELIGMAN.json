  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Seligman soils are on plateaus and mesas with elevations between 5,800 and 6,300 feet.  They formed in slope alluvium from basaltic, pumiceous, and siliceous tuff, volcanic breccia, rhyodacite, dacite, and rhyolite.  The slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent.  The climate is semiarid with precipitation of 14 to 18 inches and occurs as thunderstorms in July, August, and September and as rain and snow in the winter.  Mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.  Average January temperature is about 37 degrees F., and average July temperature is about 74 degrees F.  Frost-free season ranges from 120 to 180 days."
