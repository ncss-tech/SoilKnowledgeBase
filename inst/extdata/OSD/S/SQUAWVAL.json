Hoopgobel soils have mean annual soil temperature of 4 to 6 degrees C and have subhorizons of the argillic horizon with identifiable secondary carbonates and 5 to 20 percent paragravel of tuff.  Senchert soils have mean annual temperatures of 3 to 4 degrees C and mean summer soil temperatures of 7 to 8 degrees C.  Stubbs soils are effervescent within 90 cm.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Squawval soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on summit and shoulder positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks with surficial additions of loess.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,955 to 2,780 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 460 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 70 days."
