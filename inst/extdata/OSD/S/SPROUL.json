  "OVERVIEW": "The Sproul series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed from tuff and other igneous materials. Sproul soils are on divides and tablelands of igneous hills and mountains and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",

The underlying bedrock is weakly to strongly cemented tuff, ash or other igneous materials having the hardness and consistency of chalk, but more gritty and lacking carbonates.  They are in a semiarid continental climate with annual precipitation of 14 to 25 inches. Mean annual soil temperatures range from 59 to 65 degrees F."
