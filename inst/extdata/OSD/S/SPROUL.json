Elevations range from 5,000 to 6,200 feet.  The underlying bedrock is weakly to strongly cemented tuff, ash or other igneous materials having the hardness and consistency of chalk, but more gritty and lacking carbonates.  They are in a semiarid continental climate with annual precipitation of 14 to 25 inches. Mean annual soil temperatures range from 59 to 65 degrees F."
