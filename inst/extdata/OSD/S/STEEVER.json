Klickitat and Skoly soils have a hue of 7.5YR or 5YR.  Milbury soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Nordby  soils are extremely gravelly sand or loamy sand below a depth of 20 to  32 inches and are very strongly acid or extremely acid below the A  horizon.  Spivey soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle- size control section."

The soils formed in colluvial landslide material from basalt,  andesite and conglomerate.  Slopes are 2 to 65 percent.  Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and wet.  The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 85 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F.  Mean July temperature is about 66 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  The  frost-free season is 100 to 160 days."
