  "OVERVIEW": "The Schott series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from volcanic mudflow breccia.  Schott soils are on ridge tops and side slopes on Cascade mountains.  Slopes range from 3 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 71 inches, (1803 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F, (12 degrees C).",
