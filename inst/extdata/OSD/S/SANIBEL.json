  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Clewiston series.  Clewiston soils are underlain with limestone at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Similar soils in other families are Anclote, Basinger, Placid, Pompano, and Sellers.  None of these soils have a histic epipedon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sanibel soils occur on broad flats, in depressed areas and in poorly defined drainageways.  Gradients are less than 2 percent.  These soils have formed in thick beds of sands beneath a thin mantle of organic materials under the influence of a high water table.  Near the type location annual precipitation averages about 63 inches and mean annual temperature is about 75 degrees F."

Dania and Lauderhill soils lack a sandy C horizon and are of organic origin.  Okeelanta soils are organic soils.  Immokalee soils are in a slightly elevated position and have a Bh horizon.  Margate soils have a solum thickness of 20 to 40 inches.  Holopaw soils do not have a histic epipedon."
