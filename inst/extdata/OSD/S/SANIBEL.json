These soils have formed in thick beds of sands beneath a thin mantle of organic materials under the influence of a high water table.  Near the type location annual precipitation averages about 63 inches and mean annual temperature is about 75 degrees F."

Dania and Lauderhill soils lack a sandy C horizon and are of organic origin.  Okeelanta soils are organic soils.  Immokalee soils are in a slightly elevated position and have a Bh horizon.  Margate soils have a solum thickness of 20 to 40 inches.  Holopaw soils do not have a histic epipedon."
