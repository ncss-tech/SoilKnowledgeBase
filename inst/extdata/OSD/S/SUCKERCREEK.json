  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges form 7 to 24 inches.  Typically, free carbonates are at the surface and occur in all parts between depths of 10 to 20 inches.  Fragments of snail shells are dispersed in some horizons.  The textural family control section averages from 8 to 18 percent clay.  Volume of gravel makes up 0 to 15 percent throughout. The reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 3.  It is loam, silt loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have a muck surface layer up to 6 inches thick.\nA Bg horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is typically stratified with textures of sand, fine sand, coarse sand, very fine sand,  loamy sand, silt loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

These soils formed in loamy alluvium overlying sandy alluvium.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 32 inches.  Frost free period ranges from 120 to 165 days.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 850 to 1200 feet."

The Crowfork, Estherville, Hawick, and Sparta soils are on nearby terraces above the floodplain.  Angus, Koronis, and Lester soils are on nearby glacial till areas.  Klossner, Medo, and Muskego soils are in abandoned meander channels or nearly level areas with organic deposits 16 to 51 inches thick."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained and very poorly drained. Runoff is negligible.  Permeability is moderate in the upper loamy alluvium and moderately rapid in the lower part.  Flooding is occasionally to frequent and very brief to long duration.  The main period of flooding is March to June, but flooding can occur following any period of high runoff.  Suckercreek soils have an apparent seasonal high water table from .5 to 1.5 feet from November to June on the poorly drained phase and +1.0 to .5 on the very poorly drained phase in most years."
