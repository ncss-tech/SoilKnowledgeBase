  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Carbonates do not occur above depths of 80 inches. The series control section does not have rock fragments. Fine sand is 50 percent or more of the sand size fraction in the series control section and below. Medium and coarser sand commonly make up less than 25 percent of the sand fraction, and less than 15 percent of it is retained on the No. 40 sieve. The soil moisture control section is dry for 20 to 35 consecutive days during the 120 days following the summer solstice.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is fine sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or loamy sand. It is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nSome pedons have an AB or BA horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value and chroma of 3 to 5. It is strongly acid or moderately acid. It is fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 2 to 6. It is typically fine sand, but it has thin strata of sand in some pedons. It is moderately acid to neutral."

Claire, Corliss, Grayling, Mahtomedi, Menahga, and Nymore soils have less than 50 percent fine sand in the series control section. Feldtman (T), Omega, Pelkie, and Shawano soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder in the series control section. Friendship soils are mottled in the lower part of the series control section. Plainbo soils have lithic contact beginning at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Serden soils are neutral or slightly alkaline in the series control section. Champlain and Sunday soils have substantially wetter soil moisture control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils typically are on undulating to rolling \"old\" dune-shaped topography on outwash plains and valley trains. Slopes are short and irregular with gradients of 0 to 25 percent. The Sartell soil formed in deeply leached, gravel free, fine sands that are mostly eolian in origin but some are glaciofluvial in origin. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 33 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 90 to 150 days. Elevation ranges from 670 to 1600 feet above sea level."
