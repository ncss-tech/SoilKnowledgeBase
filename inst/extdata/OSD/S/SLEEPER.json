    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 63 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 6 and 18 inches is dry in all parts from June 1 to October 31 and is moist in all parts from January 1 to April 30.  Slickensides commonly occur but are not present in all pedons.  Base saturation is assumed to be >75 percent throughout the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 4/2, 5/2; 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2 or 6/3.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/2; 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.  Dark colored surface layers, high in organic matter, are not thick enough to qualify for a mollic epipedon.  Texture is loam or clay loam and is 15 to 30 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon is 7.5YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2; 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, or 6/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 3/4; 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4 or 5/3. Texture is clay loam or clay and is 30 to 55 percent clay.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay. Reaction is medium acid to slightly alkaline."
