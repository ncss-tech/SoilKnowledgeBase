The soil between the depths of 6 and 18 inches is dry in all parts from June 1 to October 31 and is moist in all parts from January 1 to April 30.  Slickensides commonly occur but are not present in all pedons.  Base saturation is assumed to be >75 percent throughout the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 4/2, 5/2; 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2 or 6/3.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/2; 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.  Dark colored surface layers, high in organic matter, are not thick enough to qualify for a mollic epipedon.  Texture is loam or clay loam and is 15 to 30 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon is 7.5YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2; 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, or 6/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 3/4; 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4 or 5/3. Texture is clay loam or clay and is 30 to 55 percent clay.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay.
