The soils are usually dry and are dry in all parts between a depth of 8 inches and the lithic contact more than 100 days within the four-month period following the summer solstice and are moist in the winter.  Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  It has 5 to 20 percent rock fragments.  The solum has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick.  It has 5 to 18 percent clay and 40 to 75 percent sand.  Base saturation is 80 to 100 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam, sandy loam, gravelly loam or gravelly sandy loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a cambic B horizon that is slightly or noneffervescent and may contain up to 10 percent durinodes."

Godde soils are moderately acid to neutral and have a mean annual soil temperature of 57 degrees F.  Iron Mountain, Kuhl, and Yakus soils have xeric moisture regime.  Soaplake soils have a cambic horizon.  Ladycomb soils are 4 to 10 inches to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Slopes are 0 to 40 percent.  The soils formed in residual material weathered from tuff, diatomite and other volcanic rocks mixed with ash.  The climate is semiarid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 14 inches.  The mean January temperature is 28 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 67 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 46 to 55 degrees F.   The frost-free period is 70 to 160 days."
