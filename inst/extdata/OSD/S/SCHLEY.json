  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum commonly is 40 to 60 inches thick but ranges to more than 60 inches in some pedons.  Depth to carbonates typically is greater than 60 inches.  The loamy sediments are 32 to 48 inches thick.  In most pedons a stone line is at the contact of materials 1 and 2.  Content of stones and pebbles is 2 to 8 percent in the Bt horizon and 2 to 5 percent in the 2Bt and 2C horizons.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or silt loam with fine to coarse sand content of 20 to 35 percent.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 with few or no mottles or chroma of 3 with common or many grayish mottles.  Some very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) colors are in the range if the rubbed colors are higher than 3.5 value.  The range in texture is the same as in the Ap horizon.  The BE and Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 8 as matrix and mottle colors.  One and commonly more horizons have chroma of 3 or more in at least half the matrix.\nThe BE and Bt horizon typically is loam, sandy loam, or silty clay loam but includes silt loam.  The content of clay ranges from about 15 to 28 percent.  The 2Bt horizon typically is mottled with colors of 7.5YR and 2.5Y hue, but 10YR hue is in the range.\nThe 2Bt and 2C horizons commonly are loam, but clay loam and sandy clay loam are in the range.  A sandy substratum phase is recognized."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Beardstown, Cantril, Conover, Dundas, Manheim, Metamora, Monitor, Riceville, Romulus, and Skyberg series in the same family and the Floyd series.  Beardstown soils lack 2B horizons in their sola.  Cantril soils have clay content of 28 to 35 percent in the B horizon.  Conover and Metamora soils have thinner, less acid sola.  Dundas soils formed in nonstratified glacial till and have a thinner sola.  Manheim soils have a high content of black shale materials and contain more clay.  Monitor soils are less acid.  Riceville and Skyberg soils lack the textural stratification in the upper sola and are higher in clay.  Romulus soils have 28 to 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon and are less acid.  Floyd soils have thicker, darker surface layers and lack E horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Schley soils formed in medium and moderately coarse textured, stratified materials with one or more pebble bands and in the underlying pre-Wisconsin glacial till.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 30 to 34 inches."

The moderately well drained Bassett, Kenyon, Cresco, Cresken, and Lourdes soils and the well drained Ostrander soils are on the adjacent higher part of the till plain.  Schley soils lie downslope from the Bassett, Cresco, Cresken, and Kenyon soils, which formed in glacial till, and upslope from the Clyde soils, which formed from local alluvium.  The Schley soils form a partial biosequence with the Floyd soils."
