    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shawave soils are on fan remnants, fan skirts, and mountain valley fans.  These soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rock with a small component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. Elevations are 1,220 to 1,770 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 9 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 110 to 130 days."
