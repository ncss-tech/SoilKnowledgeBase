  "OVERVIEW": "The Shawave series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Shawave soils are on fan remnants, fan skirts, and mountain valley fans.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
