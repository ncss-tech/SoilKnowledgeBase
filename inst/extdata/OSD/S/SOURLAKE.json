  "OVERVIEW": "The Sourlake series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loamy alluvial deposits of Holocene age.  These soils are meandering channels of creeks and streams.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent but mainly less than 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1422 mm (56 in).",

The Mantachie series is associated with the Southern Coastal Plain MLRA.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in). (A, Bw, Bg1 horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 10 cm (0 to 4 in). (A horizon)\nAquic conditions: 0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 in)\nAdditional Comments: The mineralogy is assumed based on similar soils.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Particle-size analysis and pH tests were performed at the project office on 5 pedons. KSSL data on S12TX1992414. This pedon is a taxadjunct to the series since this pedon has less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
