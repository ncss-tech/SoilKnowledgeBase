  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Manco and Mantachie series. The Manco series is in MLRA 133B, at a higher elevation and in a shorter period frost free days. The Mantachie series is associated with the Southern Coastal Plain MLRA.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in). (A, Bw, Bg1 horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 10 cm (0 to 4 in). (A horizon)\nAquic conditions: 0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 in)\nAdditional Comments: The mineralogy is assumed based on similar soils.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Particle-size analysis and pH tests were performed at the project office on 5 pedons. KSSL data on S12TX1992414. This pedon is a taxadjunct to the series since this pedon has less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
