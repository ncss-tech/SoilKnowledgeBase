    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other soils in the same family.  Closely related soils are the Cohoctah, Gilford, Shoals, Sloan, and Warners series.  Cohoctah and Gilford soils are coarse-loamy, and in addition, Gilford does not have an irregular decrease of organic matter with depth.  Shoals soils do not have a mollic epipedon.  Sloan soils are fine-loamy.  Warners soils have marl within the control section."
