  "OVERVIEW": "The Stecum series consists of moderately deep to fractured, micaceous granite and gneiss, well drained soils that formed in materials derived from micaceous granite and gneiss bedrock.  These soils are on foothills of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
