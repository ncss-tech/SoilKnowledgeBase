These soils formed in materials weathered from micaceous granite and gneiss bedrock.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 19 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."
