  "OVERVIEW": "The Sturges series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils formed in loess or loess and the underlying pedisediment. These soils are on upland ridges of hills and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is 54 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 36 inches.",
