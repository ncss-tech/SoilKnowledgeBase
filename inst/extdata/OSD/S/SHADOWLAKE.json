  "OVERVIEW": "The Shadowlake series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in tephra over or mixed with till from volcanic rocks. Shadowlake soils are on ground moraines and glacial-valley walls in the Southern Cascade mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 83 inches (2108 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F (5 degrees C).",
