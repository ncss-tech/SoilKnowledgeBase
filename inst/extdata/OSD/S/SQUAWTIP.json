  "OVERVIEW": "The Squawtip series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Squawtip soils are on sideslopes of mountains and hills.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
