  "OVERVIEW": "The Snakepit series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sands and alluvium derived from basalt and welded tuff. Snakepit soils are on depressions of plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
