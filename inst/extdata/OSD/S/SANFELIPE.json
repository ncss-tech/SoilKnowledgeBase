  "OVERVIEW": "The Sanfelipe series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone and calcareous siltstones and sandstones on outwash fans and fan terraces. Permeability is moderate in the upper part and rapid in the lower part. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
