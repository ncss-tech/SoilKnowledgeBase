The soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from limestone and calcareous siltstones and sandstones. The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring and dry in summer. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 37 to 42 degrees F. The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
