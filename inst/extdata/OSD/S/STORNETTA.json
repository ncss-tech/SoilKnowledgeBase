  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Soil depth is greater than 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature ranges from 6 to 9 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 6 and 18 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to June 1.  It is dry in some or all parts from July 1 to October 1 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 25 percent clay.  Organic carbon decreases irregularly with increasing depth.  Reaction is slightly alkaline through slightly acid.\nThe Ap horizon is 2.5Y 6/4; 10YR 5/3 or 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3 or 4/3.  Redox depletions are 2.5Y 6/2, or 2.5Y 5/2 moist; redox concentrations are 10YR 5/6 or 5/8, or 10YR 5/6 moist.  Redox features occur between the depths of 2 and 10 inches.  It is loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon is 2.5Y 6/4 or 10YR 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2 or 3/3.  It is stratified fine sandy loam, silt loam and loam.  Clay content ranges from 10 to 27 percent."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Stornetta soils occur on floodplains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 10 to 100 feet.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches.  Mean January temperature is 48 degrees F., mean July temperature is 57 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 250 to 330 days."

Cabrillo soils have mottles between 30 and 50 inches, and have thick umbric epipedons.  Crispin soils lack mottling, and are moderately deep to a cemented pan.  Flumeville soils have mottles between 10 and 30 inches, have a clayey particle-size class, an argillic horizon and a mollic epipedon.  Mallopass soils have mottles between 50 and 70 inches, and have thick mollic epipedons.  Windyhollow soils have mottles between 30 and 50 inches, and have mollic epipedons."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; the soil is saturated with water in the upper 6 inches for extended periods following episodes of heavy rain from December through April.  The saturated zone exists above a dense layer caused by grazing.  The soils are frequently flooded for brief periods from December through April.  Surface runoff under bare soil conditions is ponded through slow; permeability is moderate."
