These soils were previously mapped with the Colby series because they were thought to be fine-silty.\nADDITIONAL DATA: National Soil Survey Laboratory Data available for pedons S88NE-057-007, S88NE-057-001 and S90NE-057-021.\nOTHER DATA:\nT:\nK:\nWEG:\nWEI:\nModified format by LRM in 6/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
