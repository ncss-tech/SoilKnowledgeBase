    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to till ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 16 inches and corresponds to the thickness of the A horizon.  Depth to carbonate typically corresponds to the depth to the till.  The C horizon above the till, where it occurs, is calcareous in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is loamy fine sand or loamy sand, but is sandy loam or fine sand in some pedons.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  It has few or common, faint to distinct redox features and oxide stains.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand or fine sand.  It has common or many redox features.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have an AC horizon up to 10 inches thick with similar properties.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or fine sand.  Redox features range from common to many, fine to coarse, and faint to prominent.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk and 2C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They typically are loam or clay loam, but are silt loam or silty clay loam containing thin lenses of coarser textures in some pedons.  Few to many, fine or medium accumulations of carbonate are in the upper part.  Redox features are distinct or prominent.  Common fine nests of gypsum are in the lower part in some pedons.  They are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
