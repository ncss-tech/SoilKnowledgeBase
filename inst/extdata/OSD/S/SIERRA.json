  "OVERVIEW": "The Sierra series consists of deep to very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from intrusive igneous rocks. Sierra soils are on foothills and have slopes of 0 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 860 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C.",
