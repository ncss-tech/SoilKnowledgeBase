Coombs and Thompsonflat soils do not have a root-restrictive layer in the series control section and formed in mixed alluvium. Millvilla, Flanly and Verjeles have root-restrictive bedrock contacts within 100 cm. Craigsaddle soils are 100 to 150 cm to a densic contact. Motherlode soils are 100 to 150 centimeters to a lithic contact with metavolcanic rock. Wardsferry soils are 100 to 150 cm to a paralithic contact with metasedimentary rock. Yellowlark soils formed in mixed alluvium and are 100 to 150 centimeters to a duripan."
