These soils formed in residuum weathered from white tuff strata of the Duff, Pruett and Devil Graveyard Formations.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches, with most occurring from July through September.  Mean annual air temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F.  Frost free period is 210 to 250 days, and elevation is 3,500 to 5,000 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Borunda, Gemelo, Holguin, and Reduff soils.  Borunda soils are moderately deep to weathered tuff bedrock, have calcic and gypsic horizons, and are in the fine-loamy family.  Borunda soils are on adjacent erosional slopes and pediments.  Gemelo soils are very deep, have cambic horizons, and are in the coarse-loamy family.  They are on lower alluvial fan aprons.  Holguin soils are underlain by cemented conglomerate bedrock and occur on ridge caps higher in the landscape.  Reduff soils are underlain by red tuff bedrock and are on similar landform positions."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (A and Bk horizons)  The soil may meet all requirements for a mollic epipedon, except some part of the epipedon is moist for less than 90 days cumulative in normal years during times when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F.\nLithic contact - the boundary at 8 inches (R/Bk horizon)\nUstic feature - the soil has an aridic moisture regime that borders on the ustic regime\nEntisol feature - The absence of diagnostic subsurface horizons\nSuperactive cation exchange activity class - CEC to percent clay ratio is 0.60 or greater.  This is assumed from the abundant zeolitic minerals in the Duff and Pruett Tuffs, and from laboratory data from similar soils in Presidio County, Texas.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nSeries does not have a consistent mappable cambic horizon as determined by field soil scientist.
