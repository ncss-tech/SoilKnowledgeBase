  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The upper 7 to 10 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  Base saturation (by sum) is estimated to be 35 to 50 percent.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 70 percent rock fragments and 8 to 15 percent clay.  Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral throughout.  The umbric epipedon is 7 to 10 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has values of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe 2C horizon has values of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is very channery loam, extremely channery loam, or very channery sandy loam.  It has 40 to 70 percent channers and 0 to 10 percent flagstones."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Shermount soils are on shoulders and ridges of mountains usually with southerly aspects.  Elevation ranges from 5,000 to 6,200 feet.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from sedimentary rock that consists of interbedded sandstone and shale with a mixture of ash on the surface.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 35 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 18 to 22 degrees F, average July temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F, and the average annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 70 to 90 days."
