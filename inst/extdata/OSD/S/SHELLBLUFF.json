From Jackson go about 0.5 mile south on State Highway 5; go southwest on county road for about 2.2 miles to Seaboard Coastline Railroad and entrance to Cowden Plantation; continue of farm road for about 4.5 miles taking two consecutive left forks to Bent Lake; proceed east for about 500 feet; take farm road north for about 1650 feet; go north on another farm road for about 75 feet. Site is in a cleared area about 35 feet south of center of road."

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to more than 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. The soil is very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the profile. In most pedons, flakes of mica range from none to common in the upper part of the profile, and from few to common in the lower part.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 8. The A horizon is silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Masses of iron accumulation in shades of red, brown, or yellow are in most pedons. At depths of 24 inches or more, iron depletions having chroma of 2 or less range from none to common. The Bw horizon is silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, or loam.\nSome pedons have buried A and/or B horizons, below a depth of 25 inches, that have the same color and texture range as the A and B horizons.\nThe C or Cg horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 8. Redoximorphic features in shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray are in most pedons. Texture of the horizon commonly is silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, or loam; or it is stratified silty clay loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series with the same classification. Soils in closely related families include Cascilla, Cartecay, Chenneby, Chewacla, Congaree, Riverview, and Toccoa series. Cascilla soils do not have iron depletions in the upper 40 inches of the solum. Somewhat poorly drained Cartecay soils have a coarse-loamy particle size control section. Somewhat poorly drained Chenneby soils have iron depletions that have chroma of 2 or less within 24 inches of the surface. Somewhat poorly drained Chewacla, well drained Congaree, and well drained Riverview soils have a fine-loamy particle size control section. Toccoa soils have a coarse-loamy particle size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Shellbluff soils formed in fluvial sediments on flood plains along streams that drain from the Piedmont. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 67 degrees F.; the mean annual precipitation ranges from 44 to 48 inches; and the frost-free season ranges from 220 to 240 days. These soils flood for brief periods, mostly in winter and early spring."

Poorly drained Chastain soils have a fine particle size control section. Poorly drained Wehadkee soils have a fine-loamy particle size class control section."
