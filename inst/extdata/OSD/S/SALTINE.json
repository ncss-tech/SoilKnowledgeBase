  "OVERVIEW": "The Saltine series consists of very deep somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy alluvium high in exchangeable sodium.  The soils are on flood plains in river valleys in Loess Uplands in MLRA 102C Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is 11 degrees C. (51 degrees F.) and mean annual precipitation is 710 millimeters (28 inches) at the type location.",

Changes some terms in profile and range of characteristics to appropriate terminology and well as adding metric measurements.  Updated mean annual soil temp to fit with mean annual air temp. Updated electrical conductivity ranges to fit NSSH ranges.  Deleted statements pertaining to closely related families in Competing Series section.  Added frequently flooded. Added LLRs and MLRAs to Distribution and Extent."
