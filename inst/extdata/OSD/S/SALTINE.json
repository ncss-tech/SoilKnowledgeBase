Changes some terms in profile and range of characteristics to appropriate terminology and well as adding metric measurements.  Updated mean annual soil temp to fit with mean annual air temp. Updated electrical conductivity ranges to fit NSSH ranges.  Deleted statements pertaining to closely related families in Competing Series section.  Added frequently flooded. Added LLRs and MLRAs to Distribution and Extent.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
