    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the A and/or Ap horizons is less than 30 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 2.  Texture is sand, fine sand or their mucky analogs.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 5 to 7.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3; or is neutral with value of 2.  Some pedons have a continuous layer about 1 inch thick at the top of the Bh horizon that contains about 4 or more percent organic matter.  Vertical or horizontal tongues and masses in shades of gray sand are in the Bh horizon of some pedons.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, and loamy fine sand.\nThe BW horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nSome pedons have a bisequum of E'2 and B'2h horizons.  Where present, the E'2 horizon has hue, value, and chroma similar to the E horizon and the B'h horizon is similar to the Bh horizon."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Estero, Janney, and Ona series in the same family and the Lawnwood series in similar families.  The very poorly drained Estero soils are on slightly lower coastal positions and have a histic epipedon.  The poorly drained Janney soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and are moderately deep to limestone.  The poorly drained Ona soils are on similar to slightly higher positions, have A horizons less than 10 inches thick, and lack an E horizon.  The poorly drained Lawnwood soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and are in the Orstein family."

Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The average annual temperature ranges from 72 to 75 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches."

Basinger soils are on similar positions but lack a fully developed spodic horizon.  The excessively drained St. Lucie soils are on higher adjacent positions and lack a spodic horizon.  Wabasso soils are on similar positions, are deep to very deep to limestone bedrock, and have an argillic horizon of high base status below the spodic horizon."

Principal vegetation of the forested areas is longleaf pine, slash pine, and pond pine with an undergrowth of sawpalmetto, gallberry, waxmyrtle, huckleberry, and pineland threeawn.  Some areas that have adequate water control are used for citrus, improved pasture, and special crops."
