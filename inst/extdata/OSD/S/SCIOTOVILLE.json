  "OVERVIEW": "The Sciotoville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are shallow or moderately deep to a fragipan. These soils formed in old alluvium. They are on terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

Chalfont soils formed in loess and residuum and have a lithologic discontinuity in the lower part of the series control section. Gudgel soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Haubstadt and Robbs soils do not have mica flakes within the solum. Nabb, Plumfield, and Shakamak soils are more than 203 cm (80 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Pierpont soils do not have an argillic horizon above the fragipan."

Slope gradients commonly are 0 to 6 percent but range to 25 percent. The soils formed mainly in acid silty old alluvium and minor amounts of loamy alluvium derived largely from shale and micaceous sandstone with some quartzite. Sand and gravel commonly are at a depth of 2.1 to 3.0 meters (7 to 10 feet). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 991 to 117 mm (39 to 46 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 56 degrees F)."
