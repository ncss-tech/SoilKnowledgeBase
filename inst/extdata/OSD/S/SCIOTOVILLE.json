    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chalfont, Gudgel, Haubstadt, Nabb, Pierpont, Plumfield, Robbs, and Shakamak series. Chalfont soils formed in loess and residuum and have a lithologic discontinuity in the lower part of the series control section. Gudgel soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Haubstadt and Robbs soils do not have mica flakes within the solum. Nabb, Plumfield, and Shakamak soils are more than 203 cm (80 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Pierpont soils do not have an argillic horizon above the fragipan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sciotoville soils are on stream terraces, mainly along the Ohio River and its upper tributaries. Slope gradients commonly are 0 to 6 percent but range to 25 percent. The soils formed mainly in acid silty old alluvium and minor amounts of loamy alluvium derived largely from shale and micaceous sandstone with some quartzite. Sand and gravel commonly are at a depth of 2.1 to 3.0 meters (7 to 10 feet). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 991 to 117 mm (39 to 46 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 56 degrees F)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ginat, Weinbach, and Wheeling soils. Ginat soils are poorly drained and are on nearly level areas or in depressions. Weinbach soils are somewhat poorly drained are on nearly level areas or on gentle slopes. Wheeling soils are well drained and typically are on higher topographic positions or more sloping dissected areas along drainageways."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high above the fragipan and moderately low in the fragipan. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and moderately slow or slow in the fragipan. Flooding is rare in some areas."

The series has been correlated as a fine-silty taxadjunct of the Sciotoville series in several published soil surveys.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 33 cm (Ap1, Ap2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 33 to 150 cm (Bt, Btx horizons).\nFragipan: from a depth of 86 to 150 cm (Btx horizon).\nAquic conditions: iron depletions with chroma of 2 in all horizons below a depth of 56 cm.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
