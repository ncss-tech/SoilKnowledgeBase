  "OVERVIEW": "The Smallcone series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from hydrothermally altered andesitic rock.  Smallcone soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",

The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered volcanic rocks such as andesite.\nReaction: Strongly acid or moderately acid.  The pH is 5.6 to 6.0 in at least one part of the control section which is usually the A horizon.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: 5 to 18 percent.\nRock fragments: 35 to 75 percent, mostly fine gravel.  Lithology of fragments are hydrothermally altered volcanic rocks such as andesite or andesitic tuff.\nA horizon\nValue:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma:  4 to 6, dry or moist.\nC horizon\nValue:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma: 4 through 6, dry or moist.\nTexture: Very gravelly coarse sandy loam or extremely gravelly sandy loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Smallcone soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on shoulder and backslope positions, but may also occur on narrow summits.  These soils formed in residuum derived from hydrothermally altered andesitic rocks.  The parent rock has undergone acid-sulfate alteration resulting in a soil parent material that is enriched in aluminum and silicon and depleted in bases.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,460 to 2,134 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 9 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 15 cm (A and C horizons).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 15 cm to underlying weathered bedrock (Cr layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from the soil surface to 15 cm (A and C horizons).\nThe revision of December 2001 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, nonacid, mesic Lithic Xeric Torriorthents.  The active cation exchange activity class is estimated based on available geologic information about the effects of acid-sulfate alteration on clay minerals.  The contact at the base of the soil was changed from lithic to paralithic based on information from published soil surveys and personal experience of the original series author.\nADDITIONAL DATA: User pedon ID: 2006NV031001.\nPrevious authors and editors include JBF-OWB-WED.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
