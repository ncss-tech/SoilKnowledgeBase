  "OVERVIEW": "The Skandia series consists of very poorly drained soils formed in organic material 16 to 50 inches thick overlying sandstone bedrock. Permeability of the organic material is moderate or moderately rapid and the permeability of the  sandstone is very slow or slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to sandstone bedrock is commonly 20 to 40 inches but ranges from 16 to 51 inches.  Woody fragments are at random throughout the control section and comprise about 10 to 15 percent volume in some pedons.  The reaction of the organic portion of the control section commonly has pH of 3.5 to 4.5.\nThe broken face of the surface an subsurface tier has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR, or is neutral; value of 2 to 4; and chroma of 0 to 2. Pressed colors generally increase 1 to 2 units in value and/or chroma. These tiers consist of hemic and/or sapric material, but are primarily sapric herbaceous fibers with some woody fragments throughout.\nThe 2Cr horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The color is highly variable and is strongly dependent on the type of sandstone."

Closely related soils include the Beseman, Chippeny, Dawson, Greenwood, and Loxley soils. Chippeny soils have a reaction range in the organic material of 6.1 to 7.8, and are underlain by limestone bedrock.  The Beseman, Dawson, Greenwood and Loxley soils do not have a lithic contact within 51 inches"
