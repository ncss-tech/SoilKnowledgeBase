  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to sandstone bedrock is commonly 20 to 40 inches but ranges from 16 to 51 inches.  Woody fragments are at random throughout the control section and comprise about 10 to 15 percent volume in some pedons.  The reaction of the organic portion of the control section commonly has pH of 3.5 to 4.5.\nThe broken face of the surface an subsurface tier has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR, or is neutral; value of 2 to 4; and chroma of 0 to 2. Pressed colors generally increase 1 to 2 units in value and/or chroma. These tiers consist of hemic and/or sapric material, but are primarily sapric herbaceous fibers with some woody fragments throughout.\nThe 2Cr horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The color is highly variable and is strongly dependent on the type of sandstone."

Closely related soils include the Beseman, Chippeny, Dawson, Greenwood, and Loxley soils. Chippeny soils have a reaction range in the organic material of 6.1 to 7.8, and are underlain by limestone bedrock.  The Beseman, Dawson, Greenwood and Loxley soils do not have a lithic contact within 51 inches"

These soils have an apparent seasonal high water table that ranges from one foot above the surface to one foot below the surface at some time during the year from September to May. Surface runoff is negligible to low.  Permeability in the organic layers is moderate or moderately rapid and very slow or slow in the sandstone."
