The particle-size control section averages 35 to 80 percent coarse fragments and 15 to 50 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregates.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe C1 horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6 moist, 4 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4 moist or dry.  Texture of the surface layer is variable and ranges from loamy sand to extremely cindery sand.\nThe C2 horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist.  It is very gravelly loamy sand, extremely gravelly loamy sand, or extremely cobbly sand.  Fine stratification with varying amounts of gravel is common."

Alflack and Ragamuffin soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Castlepeak soils lack volcanic glass and glass aggregates in the profile and have Bw horizons. Chena, Graylock, Mirror Lake, Nizina, Ovando, and Stecum soils lack volcanic ash in the particle-size control section. In addition, Chena soils have a mean annual soil temperature of about 30 degrees F.  Cryomont soils have A and Bw horizons and have solum thickness of 10 to 18 inches.  Graylock soils have a chroma of 3 or 4 in the control section, lack basalt fragments, and have granitic rock fragments in the control section.  Howardsville, Nataga, and Pirapeak soils lack volcanic glass and glass aggregates in the soil profile. Nataga soils also receive 35 to 60 inches of annual precipitation.  Legault soils are shallow to bedrock.  Mirror Lake soils have 35 to 70 percent quartzite and sandstone fragments in the control section, and have a hue of 7.5YR or 5YR in the C horizon.  Stecum soils have a lithic contact within 40 inches of the surface.  Canladore soils have an albic horizon.  Polepatch soils have an A horizon.  Obscurity soils are stratified in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Studebaker soils are on highly irregular, dissected fill in the Toutle River Valley at elevations of 2,700 to 5,500 feet.  Studebaker soils formed in avalanche debris material from the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens.  These deposits are 20 to 200 feet in depth.  The climate is characterized by warm, moist summers and cold, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 125 to 140 inches including considerable snowfall.  Average January temperature is 25 degrees F; average July temperature is 59 degrees F; and average annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The growing season is 70 to 90 days."
