  "STATES": "ME",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Shirley series consists of very deep, moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained soils on till plains and ridges.  These soils formed in glacial till derived from slate and fine grained metasandstone with lesser amounts of granite, gneiss or schist.  Slope ranges from 3 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches at the type location.",

This revision reflects a change in classification from loamy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Aquic Haplorthods to loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Typic Endoaquods to conform with Keys to Soil Taxonomy, seventh edith, 1996.  2.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - 0 to 8 inches (Oa and E horizons)\nb.  Albic horizon - 3 to 8 inches (E horizon)\nc.  Spodic horizon - 8 to 18 inches (Bs1 and Bs2 horizons)\nd.  Aquod feature - redox features within 20 inches of the mineral soil surface in the spodic horizon (Bs2 horizon)."
