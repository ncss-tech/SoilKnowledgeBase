Depth to secondary calcium carbonate ranges from 18 to 28 inches.\nThe A horizon is dark brown (7.5YR 4/2; 10YR 4/3), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), or very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2).  It is dominantly clay loam, but is sandy clay loam or loam.\nThe Btk horizon is dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2, 2/2, 3/3), dark brown (7.5YR 4/2, 3/2), or reddish brown (5YR 4/3).  The Bt and Btk horizons are clay loam or clay with a clay content of 35 to 50 percent.  The Bt horizon is slightly acid through moderately alkaline.  The Btk horizon is reddish brown (5YR 5/4, 4/4), brown (7.5YR 5/2, 5/4), light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), or reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) and some pedons have a few faint brownish or yellowish mottles.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.  The C horizon is pink (5YR 7/3, 7/4), light reddish brown (5YR 6/3, 6/4), reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6), light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), or very pale brown (10YR 7/3, 7/4).  It is clay loam or sandy clay loam.\nIn some pedons the C horizon has a few faint to distinct reddish brown and reddish yellow mottles.  Sandstone fragments are few to common below about 40 inches."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Similar soils include the Floresville, Normangee and Webb series.  Floresville and Webb soils have mixed mineralogy and secondary forms of calcium carbonate occur at depths of more than 28 inches.  Normangee soils have mean annual soil temperatures less than 72 degrees F."

Slope gradients dominantly range from 0 to 3 percent but are up to 5 percent.  The soil formed in calcareous clay loams such as that of the Willis Point formation that are 6 to 10 feet thick over mudstone or sandstone.  The climate is subtropical.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 36 inches; the Thornthwaite P-E index is about 36 to 44.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 70 to 72 degrees F."

In addition, Willacy soils have friable epipedons when the soil is moist.  The Miguel soils, as well as the Willacy soils have secondary calcium carbonate at depths below 28 inches.  These soils occur on similar surfaces."
