Depth to secondary calcium carbonate ranges from 18 to 28 inches.\nThe A horizon is dark brown (7.5YR 4/2; 10YR 4/3), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), or very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2).  It is dominantly clay loam, but is sandy clay loam or loam.\nThe Btk horizon is dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2, 2/2, 3/3), dark brown (7.5YR 4/2, 3/2), or reddish brown (5YR 4/3).  The Bt and Btk horizons are clay loam or clay with a clay content of 35 to 50 percent.  The Bt horizon is slightly acid through moderately alkaline.  The Btk horizon is reddish brown (5YR 5/4, 4/4), brown (7.5YR 5/2, 5/4), light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), or reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) and some pedons have a few faint brownish or yellowish mottles.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.  The C horizon is pink (5YR 7/3, 7/4), light reddish brown (5YR 6/3, 6/4), reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6), light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), or very pale brown (10YR 7/3, 7/4).  It is clay loam or sandy clay loam.\nIn some pedons the C horizon has a few faint to distinct reddish brown and reddish yellow mottles.  Sandstone fragments are few to common below about 40 inches."

Slope gradients dominantly range from 0 to 3 percent but are up to 5 percent.  The soil formed in calcareous clay loams such as that of the Willis Point formation that are 6 to 10 feet thick over mudstone or sandstone.  The climate is subtropical.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 36 inches; the Thornthwaite P-E index is about 36 to 44.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 70 to 72 degrees F."
