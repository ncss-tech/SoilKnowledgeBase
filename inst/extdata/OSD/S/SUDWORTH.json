  "OVERVIEW": "The Sudworth series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium underlain by very gravelly or extremely gravelly loamy sand or sand. These soils are on low stream terraces and flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The potential native vegetation on rangeland areas is basin wildrye, western wheatgrass, needleandthread, bluebunch wheatgrass, green needlegrass, forbs, and shrubs. On forest areas the primary native understory vegetation is basin wildrye, western wheatgrass, western snowberry, common chokecherry, and redosier dogwood."
