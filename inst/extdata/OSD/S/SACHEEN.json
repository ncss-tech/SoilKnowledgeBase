    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The average annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is 3 to 8 percent clay and 0 to 25 percent coarse fragments.  These soils are neutral to moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Some pedons have a Bw or AC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry.  It is sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand and is gravelly in the lower part in some pedons.  It is 5 to 25 percent gravel."

Juniperbutte soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 40 to 44 degrees F and are fine sand throughout the particle-size control section.  Lowercreek has less than 5 percent gravel in the C horizon.  Shellrock soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 40 to 44 degrees F and are loamy coarse sand throughout the control section."

Slope gradients range from 0 to 70 percent. These soils formed in glaciofluvial material, alluvium, outwash, and eolian materials of mixed mineralogy.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters. The average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 35 inches and average annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 85 to 125 days."

Eloika soils are ashy over loamy and are frigid.  Clayton and Eloika soils are on terraces.  Dalkena soils are coarse-loamy over clayey and are on lake terraces. Dufort soils are ashy over loamy-skeletal and are on foothills and mountains.  Scotia and Scrabblers soils have a cambic horizon.  Scotia soils are on glacial outwash terraces.  Scrabblers soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments."
