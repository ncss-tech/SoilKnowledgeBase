  "OVERVIEW": "The Sporley series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in stratified loamy and silty glaciolacustrine deposits on dissected moraines and till floored lake plains. Permeability is moderately slow. Slopes range from 6 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
