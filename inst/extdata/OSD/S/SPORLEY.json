    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sporley soils are on dissected moraines and till-floored lake plains. Landscapes are commonly dissected and slopes range from 6 to 70 percent. These soils formed in stratified loamy and silty lacustrine sediments. Elevations range from 650 to 950 feet. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 31 to 36 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 44 degrees F. The frost free period ranges from 100 to 140 days."
