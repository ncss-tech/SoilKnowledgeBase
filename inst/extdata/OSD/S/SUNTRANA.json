  "REVDATE": "11/2002",
  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Suntrana series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in a mantle of ash-influenced loess overlying dense glaciofluvial material on glacial moraines.  Slopes range from 2 to 7 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 25 inches.",

Texture of the upper part of the control section is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam with the exchange complex dominated by amorphous material.  Texture of the lower part of the control section is dominantly silty clay loam.  Depth to the contrasting firm glaciofluvial material ranges from 14 to 20 inches.  Mottles are present below the spodic horizons.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nAn A horizon is present in some pedons, with thickness ranging from 0 to 4 inches.  Hue is 7.5YR or 10YR, value moist is 2 or 3, and chroma moist is 1 or 2.  Texture is dominantly silt loam, but ranges to include loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has value moist from 2 to 6, and chroma moist of 1 or 2.
