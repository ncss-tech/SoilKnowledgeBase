Bitterwater soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 18.3 to 20.8 degrees C., and are not appreciably moistened by summer precipitation.  Cobat soils have control sections with fine-loamy lacustrine strata in the lower part.  Colhill soils average l5 to 30 percent rock fragments in the textural control section.  Elkhills soils are not appreciably moistened by summer precipitation.  Kimberlina soils have noneffervescent A horizons and are not appreciably moistened by summer precipitation."
