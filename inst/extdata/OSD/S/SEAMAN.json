  "OVERVIEW": "The Seaman series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium with a component of volcanic ash or pyroclastic materials.  The Seaman soils are on fan skirts, and on inset fans and fan aprons of the fan piedmont.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C.",
