  "OVERVIEW": "The Skutum series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on structural benches, toeslopes, mountain slopes, and mesas.  They formed in mixed alluvium, and colluvium from sedimentary rocks.  Slope ranges from 1 to 60 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 39 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 25 inches.",
