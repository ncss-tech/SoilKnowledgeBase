  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Skutum soils are on structural benches, toeslopes, mountain slopes, and mesas at elevations of 6,400 to 10,100 feet.  They formed in gravelly alluvium and colluvium from limestone, conglomerate, sandstone and shale.  Slope gradients are 1 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 18 to 35 inches, the freeze-free period ranges from 20 to 80 days.  The mean annual temperature is 35 to 44 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 54 to 58 degrees F."
