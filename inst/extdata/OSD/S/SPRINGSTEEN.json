Reaction is extremely acid, very strongly acid, or strongly acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly or extremely gravelly silt loam or loam.  Phyllite fragments average from 40 to 70 percent.

These soils formed in volcanic ash and glacial till, slope alluvium, and colluvium from phyllite.  The average annual precipitation is 75 to 90 inches. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F.  Average January temperature is about 31 degrees F; and average July temperature is about 58 degrees F.  The frost-free season in 90 to 120 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Classification only changed 4/94 because of recent amendments to Soil Taxonomy.  This draft reflects a change in classification from loamy-skeletal, mixed Typic Cryorthods to loamy-skeletal, mixed Andic Haplocryods.  Laboratory data are available on this series.  NSSL numbers 81P3117-3123 and 80T280-282.  Data supports classification.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an albic horizon from the mineral surface to 2 inches, a spodic horizon from 2 to 17 inches, and a lithic contact at 35 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
