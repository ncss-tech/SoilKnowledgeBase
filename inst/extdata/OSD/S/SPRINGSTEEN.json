  "OVERVIEW": "The Springsteen series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and glacial till, slope alluvium, and colluvium from phyllite.  Springsteen soils are on glacially modified mountainsides and have slopes of 3  to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 80 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "content": "REMARKS: Classification only changed 4/94 because of recent amendments to Soil Taxonomy.  This draft reflects a change in classification from loamy-skeletal, mixed Typic Cryorthods to loamy-skeletal, mixed Andic Haplocryods.  Laboratory data are available on this series.  NSSL numbers 81P3117-3123 and 80T280-282.  Data supports classification.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an albic horizon from the mineral surface to 2 inches, a spodic horizon from 2 to 17 inches, and a lithic contact at 35 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
