    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The A1 horizon ranges from 2 to 6 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is typically about 15 inches but ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section range from 12 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section ranges from 12 to 20 percent clay and from 35 to 80 percent rock fragments, commonly pebbles but ranging to cobbles.  The mean annual soil temperature is 38 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F.  The soil is usually dry in all parts 50 to 55 percent of the time that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is warmer than 41 degrees F.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 2 through 4 moist.  It is commonly gravelly loam and less commonly very cobbly loam.  This horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline and noncalcareous to strongly calcareous.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 8 dry, 3 through 7 moist and chroma of 2 through 6 dry, 3 through 8 moist.  It commonly is very gravelly loam or extremely gravelly loam and less commonly extremely cobbly sandy loam or extremely cobbly loam.  This horizon is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline and slightly calcareous to strongly calcareous."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Solak soils are on a foothill slopes, mountain slopes, and ridges that have a convex or concave-convex surface.  The slope gradient is 10 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered commonly from conglomerate composed of sandstone, quartzite, and limestone, and less commonly from interbedded sandstone and limestone.  Elevations range from 6,000 to 7,750 feet. The mean annual temperature is 36 to 44 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 9 to 14 inches. Freeze-free season is 50 to 85 days."

Dagan, Falula, Jebo, Kearl, and Vanni soils have a cambic horizon.  Falula and Lundy soils have a horizon of carbonate accumulation."
