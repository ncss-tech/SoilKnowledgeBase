  "OVERVIEW": "The Scott series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in loess.  Scott soils are in closed depressions on loess uplands and stream terraces in the Central Loess Plains, MLRA 75. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 635 millimeters (25 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C. (51 degrees F).",
