    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 86 centimeters (0 to 34 inches) (A, E, Bt horizons)\nAlbic horizon: 13 to 20 centimeters (5 to 8 inches) (E horizon)\nArgillic horizon: 20 to 86 centimeters (8 to 34 inches) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nLinear extensibility: exceeds 6.0 between the surface and 100 centimeters (99 inches)\nThe Scott, drained phase, is somewhat poorly drained and does not pond water but is saturated for long durations.\nA terrace phase is recognized that has sand or coarse textured material below the loess cap at a depth of 3 to 9 meters (10 to 30 feet).\n01/2008 RRH: The Scott soils mapped in the aridic-ustic and udic moisture regimes may need to be recorrelated to the Lodgepole and Filbert series, respectively, or new series may be needed for very poorly drained soils.\n03/2006 LRM: metric conversion and changed permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity\n01/2008 RRH: Typical pedon: put moist colors first; Range of Characteristics, Bt horizon: added silty clay loam; Competing series: revised; Geographic Setting: revised, narrowed the mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature ranges; Geographically Associated Soils: revised, used only those soils at type location; Drainage: revised; Distribution and Extent: revised; Use and Vegetation: revised, plant community based on A Regional Guidebook for Applying the Hydrogeomorphic Approach to Assessing Wetland Functions of Rainwater Basin Depressional Wetlands in Nebraska, the component existing plants in NASIS is incorrect; Additional Data: revised\n12/2011 DJK: Updated basic formatting to meet MO5 standards. On landform changed depressions to closed depressions. Edited MAP and MAAT in introduction. Added elevation to typical pedon.  Changed Lat/Long to proper location (old put in wrong section about a mile away). Extended C2 horizon on typical pedon to 200 cm. Added clay and sand contents to each horizon in RIC. For textures in RIC deleted loam for E, clay loam and silt loam for BC, and clay loam and loam for the C. Added silty clay as possible texture for BC. Added redoximorphic concentrations for Bt, BC, and C horizons in RIC. Updated the competing series section to better define differences. Added elevation to geomorphic setting. Edited geographically associated soils by eliminating Hastings and adding Massie. In drainage and saturated hydraulic conductivity eliminated occasional in ponding frequency an reworded saturation statement. In distribution and extent deleted the northwest part of northeast NE.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data is available from the National Soil Survey Center, Soil Survey Laboratory for Pedon IDs 77NE035001 and 79NE059007. Pedon ID 1978NE061020 represents the Typical Pedon and is in NASIS.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
