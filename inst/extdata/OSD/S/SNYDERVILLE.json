  "OVERVIEW": "The Snyderville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or outwash derived from quartzite and sedimentary rocks.  Snyderville soils are on stream terraces, outwash terraces, and fan remnants.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
