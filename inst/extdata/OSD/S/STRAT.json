    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature 51 to 53 degrees F. These soils are usually dry in all parts between a depth of 8 and 24 inches for more than half the time when the soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F (105 to 115 consecutive days). The depth to the 2Bkq horizon and and secondary carbonates is 20 to 36 inches. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 80 percent rock fragments and 5 to 12 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry. It is cobbly, very cobbly, or very gravelly silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bkq horizon is multicolored or has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4 moist or dry. It is dominantly sand or coarse sand with 35 to 90 percent rock fragments. The upper 4 to 7 inches is loamy sand in some pedons. The rock fragments have white lime-silica coatings. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

The Haystack series are dry for 120 to 150 cumulative days, have 15 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section and lack a Bkq horizon. The Heytou soils have dense glacial till (Cd) at 20 to 40 inches. Nighthark have a sandy loam or loam fine-earth texture in the lower part of the particle-size control section. Peshastin soils have a sandy loam or fine sandy loam fine-earth texture in the lower par tof the particle-size section. The Olex series has a mean annual soil temperature of 55 to 59 degrees F, and has a silt loam cambic horizon. The Redcanyon series are 20 to 40 inches deep to lithic contact, have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 50 degrees and 18 to 30 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils have simple or complex topography and are on smooth, undulating, rolling or hilly slopes on glacial outwash plains, terraces, kames and valley trains and in glacial drainage channels at elevations of 600 to 2,800 feet. They formed in glacial outwash, mixed with loess in the upper part. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. The average January temperature is 26 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 73 degrees F.; and the average annual temperature is 49 degrees F. The frost free season is about 130 to 180 days."
