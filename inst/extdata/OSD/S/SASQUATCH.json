  "OVERVIEW": "The Sasquatch series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and mudstone. Sasquatch soils are on mountains and hills and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is approximately 2030 millimeters (80 inches) and the mean annual temperature is approximately 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
