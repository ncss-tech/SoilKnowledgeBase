  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sasquatch soils are on mountain slopes, hill slopes and broad ridgetops. Slope gradients are 5 to 75 percent. Elevations are 5 to 565 meters (115 to 1850 feet). These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sandstone and mudstone. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1650 to 2290 millimeters (65 to 90 inches). Mean winter soil temperature (December, January, and February) is approximately 9 degrees C; mean summer soil temperature (June, July, and August) is approximately 14 degrees C; and the mean annual soil temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures is less than 6 degrees C. Frost-free season is approximately 250 to 325 days."

Ladybird soils have a 20 percent decrease from the maximum clay content before a depth of 150 centimeters. Sisterrocks soils are loamy-skeletal. Yeti has a fine particle-size control section. The Footstep and Stonehill soils are on strongly convex slopes or on spur ridges above Sasquatch soils. The Ladybird soils are on linear to concave slope positions. The Sisterrocks soils are alongside the Sasquatch soils on very gravelly colluvium. The Yeti soils are in concave positions."
