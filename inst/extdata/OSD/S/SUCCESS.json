    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 50 inches. Depth to the cemented BC horizon ranges from 15 to 35 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the 0, A, and E horizons; extremely acid to moderately acid in the B horizons; and very strongly acid to slightly acid in the C horizons.  Rock fragment content in individual horizons of the particle-size control section ranges from 15 to 60 percent, but the weighted average ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  The rock fragment content of the upper 10 inches of the mineral soil ranges from 5 to 50 percent.\nThe O horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is slightly to highly decomposed plant material.\nSome pedons have an A horizon that has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam and their gravelly or cobbly analogues.  It is up to 5 inches thick.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or their gravelly analogues.\nThe Bhs or Bh horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy coarse sand, or their gravelly analogues.  Ortstein consistence ranges from 0 to 90 percent in individual pedons.\nThe upper part of the Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or their gravelly analogues.  Ortstein consistence ranges from 20 to 90 percent in individual pedons with at least one subhorizon having more than 50 percent cementation.  The lower part of the Bs horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loamy sand, sand, or their gravelly analogues.  Amorphous cementation ranges from 40 to 90 percent in individual pedons.\nThe BCm horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or their gravelly analogues.  Amorphous cementation ranges from 90 to 100 percent in individual pedons.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with same colors and textures as the BCm horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or their gravelly analogues."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Success soils are on glaciated upland plains, hills, and ridges. They formed in till derived principally from granite and gneiss. Slope is dominantly 3 to 35 percent, but range up to 60 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F and mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 50 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Becket, Hermon, and Monadnock soils in similar positions on the landscape, the Lyme and Pondicherry soils in lower positions on the landscape, and Colton soils on adjacent glaciofluvial landforms.  Becket soils are underlain by dense till.  Colton soils do not have ortstein and formed in outwash. Pondicherry soils formed in organic accumulations, are very poorly drained, and are in depressions.  Hermon soils do not have ortstein in 50 percent or more of each pedon.  Lyme soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections, are poorly drained, and are in drainageways.  Monadnock soils are without ortstein and amorphous cementation and have coarse loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  1.  Success soils were formerly included with the Hermon soils in New Hampshire.  2.  The particle-size class is bordering sandy and loamy-skeletal.  3.  Numerous observations have not detected any perching of water above the ortstein or amorphous cemented layers in this soil. While the predicted permeability of these cemented layers would be expected to be moderately slow, this soil appears to have moderately rapid permeability in these layers.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
