Thickness of the glacial till deposit ranges from 5 to 12 inches thick. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout. Soft shale fragments that are easily crushed ranges from 0 to 12 percent in the A and BA horizon and from 3 to 30 percent in the Bw and C horizons.  Weighted average calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 40 to 70 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or very fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe BA and Bw horizons have hue of 5YR to 2.5Y; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.  Reaction of the Bw horizon is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizons have hue of 5YR to 2.5Y; value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  They are silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam. Reaction is moderately alkaline."
