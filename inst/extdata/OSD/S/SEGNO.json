    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The series type location was moved during the update of MLRA 152B to better represent the series concept. The previous type location based on pedon S64TX-170-4 is located in an area close to the Willis Formation and Lissie Formation contact. The majority of the Segno soils are mapped over the Lissie Formation. The Lissie Formation areas typically have less than 5 percent plinthite. Some areas were correlated to the Otanya series in previous surveys. Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon:  0 to 42 cm (0 to 16.5 in) (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon:  42 to 203 cm (31.9 to 80 in) (Bt/E, Bt, Btc horizons)\nGlossic horizon: 42 to 81 cm, (16.5 to 31.9 in)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Kellogg Soil Survey Lab data available on pedon S12TX29111035. Data from 3 pedons in Montgomery County are published in SSIR-30 (S64TX-170-3 and S64TX-170-4) and pedon S78TX-339-001 in Characterization Data for Selected Texas Soils, Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, January 1986.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
