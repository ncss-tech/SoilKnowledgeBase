    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum is 30 to 47 inches over unrelated 2B horizon or stratified C horizon. The mean annual soil temperature is 51 to 57 degrees F.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from early March to early December (345 days) and exceeds 47 degrees F. from early April to early December.  The soil moisture control section (5 to 20 inches) is dry in all parts from mid July to mid October (90 to 110 days).  The particle-size control section (10 to 40 inches) ranges 8 to 18 percent clay, more than 15 percent soil coarser than very fine sand, 50 to 65 percent total sand and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments, mostly gravel.  Some pedons have more rock fragments in the 2Bt horizon where present.  Base saturation by ammonium acetate ranges from 75 to 95 percent in the A horizon and Bt horizon.  Some pedons do not have a buried unrelated 2Bt horizon.  Rock fragments, mostly gravel, on the soil surface, range from 20 to 30 percent.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3; 7.5YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4; 7.5YR 3/2, or 3/4.  Those colors that are dark lack the thickness to qualify for a mollic epipedon.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 4 percent.  Clay content ranges from 8 to 17 percent.  Rock fragments, mostly gravel range from 15 to 35 percent.\nThe Bt horizon color is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6, 7/3; 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6 or 6/4, 6/6.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, or 5/4.  Texture is gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loam.  Clay content ranges from 8 to 17 percent.  Rock fragments, mostly gravel range from 15 to 35 percent.\nThe C horizon where present is stratified with varying textures and amounts of rock fragments, but color ranges are similar to the B horizon."

These soils formed in alluvium from metamorphosed sedimentary and igneous rock with some rocks high in serpentine minerals.  Elevation is 2,000 to 4,000 feet.  The climate is continental and subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 30 inches.  Snowfall is 20 to 36 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is 32 to 36 degrees F.  The mean July temperature is 67 to 69 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 80 to 140 days."
