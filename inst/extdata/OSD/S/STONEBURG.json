  "REVDATE": "04/2007",
  "STATES": "KS,OK,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Stoneburg series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in materials\nweathered from sandstone.  These soils are on gently sloping\nuplands.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to contact\nwith strongly cemented to indurated sandstone is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), grayish brown\n(10YR 5/2), or brown (10YR 4/3, 5/3; 7.5YR 4/2, 5/2).  It is fine sandy loam or loam and medium acid through neutral.\nThe B1t horizon, where present, is brown (7.5YR 4/4, 5/4), or\nreddish brown (5YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4).  It is loam or light sandy clay loam and is slightly acid or neutral.  The B2t horizons are\nclay loam or sandy clay loam with clay contents of 25 to 35\npercent.\nThe B21t horizon is reddish brown (5YR 4/4, 5/4) or yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 5/6).  It is medium acid through neutral.\nThe B22t horizon is yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 4/8, 5/6, 5/8),\nreddish yellow (5YR 6/6, 6/8; 7.5YR 6/6, 6/8), or reddish brown\n(5YR 4/4, 5/4), with few to common mottles of red, reddish yellow, strong brown, or yellowish brown.  Rock fragments in the B22t\nhorizon larger than 3 inches in diameter range from 0 to 10\npercent by volume; rock fragments less than 3 inches in diameter range from 2 to 15 percent by volume.  Reaction is medium acid through mildly alkaline."

The soil formed in residuum from hard sandstone,\nmainly of Permian Age.  The climate is dry subhumid.  Average\nannual temperature near the type location is 64.7 degrees F.  The annual precipitation is about 32 inches, and the Thornthwaite P-E index is 49."
