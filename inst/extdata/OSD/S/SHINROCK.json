  "OVERVIEW": "The Shinrock series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on lake plains. They formed in silty and clayey glaciolacustrine sediments. Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",

Slope gradient typically is 2 to 10 percent but ranges from 0 to 20 percent. The soils formed in silty and clayey glaciolacustrine sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1067 mm (27 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 180 days. Elevation is 183 to 305 meters (600 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

Kibbie soils are in areas of the lake plain that contain more sand and less clay. Del Rey, Lenawee, Milford, and Saylesville soils are in a toposequence with Shinrock soils. Del Rey soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on lower, nearly level areas or on slopes along drainageways. Lenawee and Milford soils are poorly drained or very poorly drained and are in depressions or on broad, flat areas of the lake plain. Saylesville soils are well drained and are on higher topographic positions or on steeper slopes along drainageways."

The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) between December and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderately slow in the solum and moderate or moderately slow in the substratum."
