Cardington and Ellsworth soils have rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Geeburg and Wyatt soils have dominant textures with more than 40 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Glynwood and Mortimer soils have a densic contact within the series control section. Pert soils formed in till and are not stratified in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Shinrock soils are on lake plains of late Wisconsin age that have been dissected by modern stream valleys. Slope gradient typically is 2 to 10 percent but ranges from 0 to 20 percent. The soils formed in silty and clayey glaciolacustrine sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1067 mm (27 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 180 days. Elevation is 183 to 305 meters (600 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Del Rey, Kibbie, Lenawee, Milford, and Saylesville soils. Kibbie soils are in areas of the lake plain that contain more sand and less clay. Del Rey, Lenawee, Milford, and Saylesville soils are in a toposequence with Shinrock soils. Del Rey soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on lower, nearly level areas or on slopes along drainageways. Lenawee and Milford soils are poorly drained or very poorly drained and are in depressions or on broad, flat areas of the lake plain. Saylesville soils are well drained and are on higher topographic positions or on steeper slopes along drainageways."

The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) between December and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderately slow in the solum and moderate or moderately slow in the substratum."
