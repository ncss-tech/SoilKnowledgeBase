  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Snapcan soils are on summits and side slopes of dissected fan terraces and ballenas. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from fanglomerate dominated by granite, schist and gneiss. Slopes are 30 to 55 percent. The elevations are 1150 to 2500 feet. The climate is low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in summer, typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches; the mean annual air temperature is 70 to 74 degrees F.; and the frost free period is 320 to 350 days."
