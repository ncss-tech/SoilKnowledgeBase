    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are the following:\nOchric epipedon\nAlbic horizon - 2 to 6 inches (E horizon)\nGlossic horizon - 6 to 16 inches (E/Bt1 and E/Bt2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon - 11 to 62 inches (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, and 2Bt4 horizons)\nOxyaquic feature - perched water table is at its highest depth between the months of November through April and is present for 120 to 180 cumulative days.\nPSCS - 11 to 31 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and 2Bt3 horizons)\nThe soils formed in relic proglacial lake deposits in a wetter environment.  The presence of albic materials and redox features in the upper most horizons were not formed from present day pedogenesis.\nDepth to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.  Based on the color combinations in the glossic horizon some pedons will classify as aquertic subgroup and are considered taxadjuncts.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL pedon number 94P0072; taxadjunct.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
