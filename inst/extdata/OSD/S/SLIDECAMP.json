The presence of albic materials and redox features in the upper most horizons were not formed from present day pedogenesis.\nDepth to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.  Based on the color combinations in the glossic horizon some pedons will classify as aquertic subgroup and are considered taxadjuncts.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL pedon number 94P0072; taxadjunct.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
