  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 days in most years during late summer. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 52 degrees F. The argillic horizon contains 35 to 60 percent rock fragments by volume. The solum is slightly acid or neutral throughout.  Base saturation is less than 75 percent.\nWhen undisturbed an O2 horizon up to 1 inch thick is present.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 through 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4. Rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent by volume."
