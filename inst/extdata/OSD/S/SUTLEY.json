    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates is less than 10 inches.  Areas in native grass are leached of carbonates in the upper few inches in some pedons. Particle size control section contains 12 to 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  An AC horizon, 2 to 5 inches thick, is present in some pedons and has colors similar to the A horizon.\nThe Bk and C horizon have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  The Bk horizon has few to many, fine to coarse accumulations of carbonates.  Some pedons have sandstone, shale, or glacial till at depths of 40 to 60 inches."

Slopes are plane to convex.  These soils formed in calcareous loess or silty glacial drift.  The mean annual temperature is less than 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from l5 to l8 inches."

Linton soils are leached of carbonates to greater depths.  They are on similar landscapes as the Sutley soils.  Cabba soils are shallow to a paralithic contact.  Grassna soils have mollic epipedons greater than l6 inches thick and are on slightly lower positions on the landscape.  Vida and Zahl soils are fine-loamy."
