  "OVERVIEW": "The Shane series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from semiconsolidated clay shale.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the surface to 12 inches (Ap and Bt1 horizons); an argillic horizon from 7 to 18 inches with an abrupt textural increase (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons); accumulation of lime from 18 to 36 inches (Bk horizon); a paralithic contact at 36 inches (Cr horizon).  Surface horizons may become cloddy when plowed and have evidence of bleached sand grains.  Shane soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.\nAdditional Data:  Laboratory data, S71MT-013-6; S89MT-015-701."
