  "OVERVIEW": "The Shrubcreek soils consist of deep, well drained soils formed in a volcanic ash mantle over colluvium and residuum from basalt.  These soils are on ridges, plateaus and mountain side lopes with slopes of 0 to 60 percent.  Average annual precipitation is 22 to 30 inches.  Average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The volcanic ash mantle is 14 to 30 inches thick.  The soil is greater than 60 inches to bedrock.  The upper part of the 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.80 to 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, phosphate retention of 50 to 75 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 8 to 12 percent.  The lower part has a clay content of 18 to 27 percent and rock fragment content of 5 to 15 percent.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  The texture is ashy sandy loam, ashy fine sandy loam, and ashy loam that have 5 to 10 percent rock fragments.  Field estimated clay content ranges from 5 to 10 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  Texture is ashy loam, ashy silt loam, or ashy fine sandy loam.
