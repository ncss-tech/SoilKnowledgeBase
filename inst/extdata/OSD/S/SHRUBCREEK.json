    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The volcanic ash mantle is 14 to 30 inches thick.  The soil is greater than 60 inches to bedrock.  The upper part of the 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.80 to 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, phosphate retention of 50 to 75 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 8 to 12 percent.  The lower part has a clay content of 18 to 27 percent and rock fragment content of 5 to 15 percent.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  The texture is ashy sandy loam, ashy fine sandy loam, and ashy loam that have 5 to 10 percent rock fragments.  Field estimated clay content ranges from 5 to 10 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  Texture is ashy loam, ashy silt loam, or ashy fine sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and a chroma of 2, 3, or 4 dry or moist.  Texture is loam or silt loam.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 27 percent.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 15 percent with 5 to 30 percent paragravel below 40 inches.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid."

Adams influences.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
