  "OVERVIEW": "The Snowslide series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from mixed geologic material. Snowslide soils are on foothills and fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 40 percent. Permeability is moderate. The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
