  "OVERVIEW": "The Sanmoss series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in very gravelly alluvium. They formed on alluvial fans. Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. At the type location, mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",

Medley soils occur along drainageways and low terraces, whereas Sanmoss soils are situated on alluvial fans adjacent to the bedrock uplands.  Brewster, Boracho, Espy, Mainstay soils occur within other, adjacent map units.  Brewster and Mainstay soils are on rolling to very steep hills and mountains, and are shallow to igneous bedrock.  Mainstay soils have argillic horizons.  Boracho and Espy soils are on Pleistocene age, caliche cemented alluvial fans and piedmont slopes.  They are shallow to petrocalcic horizons.  Espy soils are non-skeletal."
