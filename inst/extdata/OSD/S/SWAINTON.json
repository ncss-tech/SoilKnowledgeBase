  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Swainton soils were formerly included in the Sassafras and Downer gravelly series concepts in Cape May County, NJ. In Cape May County, NJ, most areas were mapped as gravelly substratum phases of the Downer series.\n02/2002 This revision modifies the range of gravel content to exclude previous Downer soils that contain more than 25 percent rock fragments. In addition, it modifies the gravel content of the individual horizons originally described within the Swainton typical pedon, some textures based on the review of original field notes, and defines the concept of Swainton further to allow for a lithologic discontinuity. Swainton soils formed in gravelly reworked alluvium or gravelly marine-alluvium deposits. Downer soils formed in marine or alluvial sediments, or reworked marine-alluvial sediments but typically containing much less gravel. In Downer soils, the distinction between the reworked materials and the underlying stable marine sediments as nonconforming parent materials is not evident, as it is in Swainton. Swainton soils at higher elevations, can have thick deposits of gravelly reworked material, and the underlying stable marine deposits are below 80 inches. At lower elevations, the gravelly reworked material is thinner, and stable marine sediments low in gravel are within 80 inches.\nDiagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to 3 inches (Oe, A, and E\nhorizons)\nAlbic horizon--the zone from 2 to 3 inches (E horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 4 to 23 inches (Bt horizon)\nOther soil features identified with this pedon:\nLithologic Discontinuity-abrupt decrease in rock fragment content starting at 47 inches (2C1 and 2C2 horizons)\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA: None\nDatabase Information:\nOSD Data Mapunit ID: To be developed\nTypical Pedon Data Mapunit ID: 103005\nOSD User Pedon ID: Swainton-OSD\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name  Slope  Air temp  FrFr/Seas  Precip  Elevation\nNJ0085 SWAINTON   0-5    50-58     180-220    42-48   15-170\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable  Kind  Months  Bedrock Hardness\nNJ0085 NONE          6.0-6.0             -     >72     --\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10   Clay%   -CEC-\nNJ0085  0- 4  LS                      0-  0  90-100  3- 8    3-6\nNJ0085  0- 4  SL                      0-  0  90-100  5-10    5-10\nNJ0085  4-23  SL GR-SL                0-  0  60-100  10-18   4-8\nNJ0085 23-35  GR-LS GRV-LS            0-  0  35- 75  3- 8    2-4\nNJ0085 35-74  SR FS GRV-S             0-  0  35- 90  1- 5    1-2\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
