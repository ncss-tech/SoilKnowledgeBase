  "OVERVIEW": "The Spanel series consists of shallow to an indurated duripan, well drained soils that formed alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Spanel soils are on fan piedmont remnants. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
