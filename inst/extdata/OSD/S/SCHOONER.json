    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the lithic contact is 10 to 20 inches.  The soil is 90 to 100 percent base saturated.  Coarse fragments are typically less than 5 percent and range from 0 to 15 percent.  The particle-size control section is sand or loamy sand with a relatively small percentage of medium sand or coarser.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F.  Typically, the control section is noncalcareous, but some pedons may be weakly calcareous when over weakly calcareous sandstone.  No K horizons occur within the profile.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is soft to loose and slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R.  It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Schooner soils are on ridges and hillslopes in areas where reddish colored sandstone is close to the surface.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  Elevation is 4,500 to 5,500 feet.  These soils formed in reddish brown, noncalcareous, coarse textured sediments derived from the weathering of reddish brown, usually noncalcareous sandstone.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer.  The average annual temperature is 47 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
