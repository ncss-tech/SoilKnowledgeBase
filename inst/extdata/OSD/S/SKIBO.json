  "OVERVIEW": "The Skibo series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on foothills and mountains. They formed in colluvium from limestone. They have slopes of 20 to 70 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the average annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
