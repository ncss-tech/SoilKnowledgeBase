    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Soils in a closely related family are the Alonzville, Bailegap, Beersheba, Gunstock, Hambrook, Harmiller, Jefferson, Keener, Lily, Lonewood, Marr, McCamy, Raftville (T), Riney, Sassafras, and Sunnyside series. Alonzville, Hambrook, Jefferson, Keener, Marr, Sassafrass, and Sunnyside soils are very deep. Bailegap, Beersheba and Gunstock soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Harmiller soils have paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Lonewood and Riney soils are deep and very deep to paralithic or lithic contact. Lily, McCamy, and Raftville soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Shinbone soils are on ridges and side slopes of low and intermediate mountains, commonly where there is a linear or convex surface. Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent. Elevation ranges from about 1,500 to 4,500 feet. Shinbone soils formed in residuum affected by soil creep in the upper part, weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rock such as feldspathic metasandstone, metasiltstone, and phyllite. . The mean annual air temperature ranges from about 46 to 57 degrees F., the frost free season ranges from about 100 to 150 days, and the average annual rainfall ranges from about 48 to 64 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: In addition to the competing Harmiller soils, these are the Cataska, Chestoa, Jeffrey, Lostcove, Marbleyard, McCamy, Soco, Spivey, Sylco, and Whiteoak soils. Cataska, Soco, and Sylco soils are typically on steeper parts of nearby landforms. Cataska soils are shallow and Soco soils are moderately deep to paralithic contact. Sylco soils are moderately deep to lithic contact. Chestoa and Jeffrey soils are on adjacent landscapes with cool aspects and are moderately deep to lithic contact. Chestoa soils have siliceous mineralogy and Jeffrey soils have mixed mineralogy. Lostcove, Spivey, and Whiteoak soils are on colluvial landscapes. They are very deep to bedrock. Marbleyard soils are loamy-skeletal and have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches below the soil surface. McCamy soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches below the soil surface."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Soils now included with the Shinbone series were previously mapped with Brasstown soils. Brasstown soils have an argillic horizon with hue that is dominantly 2.5YR or 5YR and have mixed mineralogy. The clay content of the particle-size control section for Shinbone soils averages about 18 percent. The fine silt content averages about 35 percent and ranges from about 25 to 45 percent. According to engineering index data, a large portion of the silt content is very fine silt. The 10/01 revision places this soil in the active CEC activity class based on NSSL data.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 9 inches (Oe, A, and BA horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 9 to 34 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nParalithic contact - weathered bedrock contact at 47 inches (upper boundary of the Cr horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE; pedon number S88NC-199-014.\nSIR = NC0248 MLRA = 130\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
