The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock of the Deschutes Formation is 10 to 20 inches.  The solum has 10 to 30 percent volcanic glass and glass coated aggregate.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 45 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 60 to 80 percent gravel.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR but may range to 5YR in the horizon above the bedrock contact.  It has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly silty clay loam or extremely gravelly clay with 40 to 70 percent gravel.\nThe 2Crkq horizon is paralithic tuff of the Deschutes Formation."
