  "OVERVIEW": "The Suak series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from quartzite, shale, sandstone, and mixed volcanic rocks. Suak soils are on mountain side slopes. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
