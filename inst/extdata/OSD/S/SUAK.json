Elaero, Heenlake, Clanalpine and Squawtip soils have paralithic contacts at less than 100 cm and lack hard bedrock within 100 cm. Hoskin soils have reddish argillic horizons with hues of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR. Valmar and Vitale soils average less than 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. In addition Vitale soils have clay loam subhorizons horizons."

Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. Elevations are 1,900 to 3,000 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
