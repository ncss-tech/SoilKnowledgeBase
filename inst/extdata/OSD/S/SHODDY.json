  "REVDATE": "06/2011",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Shoddy series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, colluvium, slide deposits or residuum derived from sedimentary rock. These soils are on hills, knolls, ridges and landslides.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
