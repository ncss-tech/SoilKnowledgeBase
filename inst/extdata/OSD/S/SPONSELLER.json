  "OVERVIEW": "The Sponseller series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium from basalt and pyroclastic rocks.  Sponseller soils are on broad ridges and hillslopes and have slopes of 3 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 F.",
