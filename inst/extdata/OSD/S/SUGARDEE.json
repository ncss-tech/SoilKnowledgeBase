Bresser soils have sandy or sandy-skeletal substrata.  Featherlegs soils have a very gravelly sandy loam IIC horizon and have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the B2t horizon.  Dagflat and Ryegate soils have a lithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.  Hargreave, Kirtley, and Rosebud soils have a paralithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.

The soils formed in reddish colored outwash materials derived principally from redbeds with influence of limestone and sandstone gravel.  The mean annual 3 - Sugardee Series\ntemperature is about 47 degrees F.  Annual precipitation is 15 to 19 inches.  The frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
