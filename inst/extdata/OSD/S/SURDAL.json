  "OVERVIEW": "The Surdal series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from hard fine grained igneous or metamorphic rock.  These soils are on escarpments, ridges and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
