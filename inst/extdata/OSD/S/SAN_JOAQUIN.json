  "OVERVIEW": "The San Joaquin series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well and moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed but dominantly granitic rock sources.  They are on undulating low terraces with slopes of 0 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature varies from 60 degrees to 64 degrees F and the soil temperature is not below 47 degrees F at any time.

Clay increases by more than 15 percent absolute.\nThe Ap or A horizon has colors of 7.5YR 4/4, 5/2, 5/4, 5/6, 6/2, 6/4, 6/6, 7/6, 7/8; 5YR 4/3, 4/4, 4/6, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 5/8; 10YR 4/3, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3 or 6/4.
