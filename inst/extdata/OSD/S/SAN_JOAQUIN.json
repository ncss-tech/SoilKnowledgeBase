    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 60 degrees to 64 degrees F and the soil temperature is not below 47 degrees F at any time.  The soil, at depths of about 7 to 24 inches or directly above the duripan, is dry in all parts from June to November and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  Clay increases by more than 15 percent absolute.\nThe Ap or A horizon has colors of 7.5YR 4/4, 5/2, 5/4, 5/6, 6/2, 6/4, 6/6, 7/6, 7/8; 5YR 4/3, 4/4, 4/6, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 5/8; 10YR 4/3, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3 or 6/4.  Moist colors are 1 or 2 units darker in value.  It is sandy loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid, but may be neutral where liming has taken place.  Base saturation is greater than 75 percent.\nThe Bt horizon when present has colors of 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6, 6/6 and 5YR 5/6.  Moist colors are 7.5YR 4/4; 5YR 4/4. Textures are sandy clay loam, loam or silt loam.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has colors of 7.5YR 6/6, 6/4, 5/6, 5/4, 5/2, 4/6, 4/4; 5YR 5/8, 5/6, 4/6, 5/4, 4/4, 3/4, 4/3, 3/3; 2.5YR 5/4, 4/8, 4/6, 4/4 or 3/4.  Moist colors are 1 or 2 units of value darker.  It is clay loam or clay but average clay content is 35 to 50 percent.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThere is an abrupt boundary at or within the upper part of the argillic horizon with an absolute clay increase of at least 15 percent.\nThe duripan has colors of 10YR 7/3, 6/4, 5/6, 5/4; 7.5YR 7/2, 6/4, 5/6, 5/4, 5/2, 4/6, 4/4, 4/2; 5YR 3/3, 4/3, 4/4, 5/6 or 5/8 and is usually variegated.  It is cemented with iron and or silica becoming less indurated with depth.  Segregated carbonates do not line fractures in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  San Joaquin soils are on hummocky, nearly level to undulating terraces at elevations of about 20 to 500 feet.  Some areas have been leveled.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  They formed in alluvium from mixed but mainly granitic rock sources.  The climate is dry with hot dry summers and cool moist and foggy winters.  Mean annual precipitation varies from 10 to 22 inches.  Average January temperature is 45 degrees F; average July temperature is 80 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 250 to 300 days."

Exeter soils lack an abrupt boundary with at least 15 percent clay increase within the argillic horizon.  Fiddyment soils average less than 35 percent within the control section.   Madera soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy."

The type location of this series has been moved to better reflect the central concept as historically mapped.  (Textures from lab data reflect slightly different values than field estimates.  NSSL S83CA-077-042.)\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 6 inches (Ap)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 16 to 26 inches (2Bt3, 2Bt4)\nDuripan - the zone from 26 to 60 inches (2Bqm1, 2Bqm2, 2Bq)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
