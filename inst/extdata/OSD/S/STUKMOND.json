  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are dry for one-half to three-fourths of the timne when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  They are usually dry and are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 120 cumulative days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  The mollic epipedon and depth to the 2Bw horizon is 10 to 15 inches.  The upper part of the solum (A, Bw1 horizons) has a phosphate retention; of 15 to 25 percent, 10 to 30 percent glass and glass coated aggregate, and acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron of 0.4 to 0.8 percent.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 20 to 30 percent stones, 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 20 percent gravel.  The sand-size (0.25 to 1.0mm) pumice content ranges from 20 to 40 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam or sandy loam and contains 0 to 10 percent gravel.  The sand-size (0.25 to 1.0mm) pumice content ranges from 15 to 30 percent.  It has 15 to 25 percent field estimated clay.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam and contains 0 to 20 percent gravel and 25 to 35 percent clay."

Iron Mountain, Kuhl, and Yakus have a xeric moisture regime.  Ladycomb soils are very shallow to bedrock.   Stukel and Soaplake soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Godde soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 57 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stukmond soils are on lava plains at elevations of 2900 to 3200 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in residuum derived from basalt with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches, the mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Redmond, Buckbert, Lickskillet, and Swartz soils.  Redmond soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Buckbert soils are deep to bedrock and are in depressions on lava plains.  Licksillet soils are skeletal and are generally found on lava blisters.  Swartz soils are fine-textured and are in closed basins on lava plains."
