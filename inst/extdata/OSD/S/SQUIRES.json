  "OVERVIEW": "The Squires series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and slope alluvium and colluvium from phyllite and glacial till high in phyllite.  They are on glacially modified mountain sides and have slopes of 5 or 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 55 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

This draft reflects a change in classification from loamy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Typic Haplorthods to loamy-skeletal, mixed, mesic, Andic Haplorthods.  Laboratory data are available on this series.   NSSL numbers 81P3124-3130.  Laboratory data supports classification.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an albic horizon from the mineral surface to 1 inch, a spodic horizon from 1 to 17 inches, and a lithic contact at 32 inches."
