These soils are usually moist but are dry in  the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 70 percent phyllite fragments. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, ay gravelly, very channery, extremely channery, or extremely gravelly silt loam, loam, or sandy loam and averages 40 to 70 percent phyllite fragments."

Ahl soils are 50 to 90 percent basalt, dry more than 60 consecutive days and slightly acid below the spodic horizon. Barnhardt, Blethen, Heisler, and Tunnel soils are more than 40 inches deep.  Vanzandt soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact with dense glacial till."

These soils formed in volcanic ash and slope alluvium and colluvium from phyllite and glacial till  high in phyllite.  The average annual precipitation is 40 to 70 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F.  Average January temperature is about 38 degrees F; and average July temperature is about 64 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 160 to 200 days."
