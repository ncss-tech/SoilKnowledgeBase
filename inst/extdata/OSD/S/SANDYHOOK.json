  "OVERVIEW": "The Sandyhook series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in thick sandy marine deposits along the Atlantic coast. The soils are subject to daily tide flooding. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to very high in the organic layers and very high in the underlying mineral sediments. Mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C and mean annual precipitation is about 1117 mm.",

They are subject to daily tidal flooding. Sandyhook soils form in thick sand deposits with thin organic surfaces. Slopes are commonly 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from 9 to 13 degrees C and mean annual precipitation ranges from 100 to 125 cm."

Barren soils have free water below 38 cm of the soil surface. Hooksan and Succotash soils formed on barriers and dune crests and are not tidally flooded. Ipswich, Matunuck and Pawcatuck soils formed in tidal marshes and have more than 20 cm of organic material on the surface."

Urban development is unlikely due to tide flooding. Native vegetation consists of saltmeadow grass, salt water grass, and spike grass. Other possible vegetation includes phragmites, blackgrass, sea lavender, saltwort, seaside goldenrod, aster, and purple gerardi."
