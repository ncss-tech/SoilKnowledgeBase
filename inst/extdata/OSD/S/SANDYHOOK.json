  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline and an oxidized pH of ultra acid to neutral. Some pedons may contain sea shells. Total salt content is generally more than 15.6 deciSiemens per meter.\nThe Oe or Oa horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, chroma of 2 or 3, and value of 2.\nThe A or Ab horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is fine sand or coarser or their mucky modifiers.\nSome pedons have an AC or CA horizon. It is 5 to 15 cm thick. It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is fine sandy loam through sand and their mucky modifiers. Consistence is very friable.\nThe Cse or Cg horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, 5GY, or N value of 1 to 5, and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture is loamy fine sand or coarser. Rock fragments range from 0 to 8 percent. Shell fragments are common.\nSome pedons have buried O horizons which are 5 to 15 cm thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sandyhook soils are on nearly level to gently sloping back-barrier flats and back-barrier beaches near tidal marshes along the Atlantic coast. They are subject to daily tidal flooding. Sandyhook soils form in thick sand deposits with thin organic surfaces. Slopes are commonly 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from 9 to 13 degrees C and mean annual precipitation ranges from 100 to 125 cm."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Barren, Hooksan, Ipswich, Matunuck, Pawcatuck, and Succotash soils on nearby landscapes. Barren soils have free water below 38 cm of the soil surface. Hooksan and Succotash soils formed on barriers and dune crests and are not tidally flooded. Ipswich, Matunuck and Pawcatuck soils formed in tidal marshes and have more than 20 cm of organic material on the surface."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to very high in the organic surface horizon and very high in the underlying sands."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of these soils are used for wildlife habitat and recreation. Small scattered areas are used for saltgrass hay. Urban development is unlikely due to tide flooding. Native vegetation consists of saltmeadow grass, salt water grass, and spike grass. Other possible vegetation includes phragmites, blackgrass, sea lavender, saltwort, seaside goldenrod, aster, and purple gerardi."
