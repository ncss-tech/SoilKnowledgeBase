  "OVERVIEW": "The Snaggletooth series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from granite. Snaggletooth soils are on fan remnants and slopes range from 1 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (about 4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 24 degrees C (about 75 degrees F).",
