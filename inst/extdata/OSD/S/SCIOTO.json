Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. The soils formed in poorly sorted outwash. Rock fragments are mainly limestone of gravel, cobble, and stone sizes. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 79 to 1067 mm (31 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F)."
