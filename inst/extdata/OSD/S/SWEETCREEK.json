  "OVERVIEW": "The Sweetcreek series consists of moderately deep, well-drained soils formed in alluvium from sandstone. These soils are on north-facing concave slopes on hills, ridges and plateaus. Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
