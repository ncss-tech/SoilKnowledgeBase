    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Swalesilver soils are on depressions on plateaus and lake terraces. These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks and volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevation ranges from 1,280 to 1,910 meters. The climate is characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, and the frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: A revision in 2001 moved the type location from Lake County to Harney County, Oregon to better represent the series concept. The prior type location had high glass content in the A horizons and classified as a vitrandic intergrade. Future study is needed on this soil to document whether enough active ferrous iron occurs in the A horizons, when aquic conditions are present, to give positive reactions to alpha,alpha-dipyridyl.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 15 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).\nAquic conditions - The conditions of episaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between the soil surface and 15 cm at certain times during normal years (A1 and A2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 15 to 58 cm (2Btl and 2Bt2 horizons).\nAbrupt textural change - The abrupt clay increase of more than 20 percent at 15 cm (between the A2 and 2Bt1 horizons).\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 58 to 86 cm (3Bk horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 15 to 58 cm (2Btl and 2Bt2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Previous authors and editors include: TDT-MPK-JVC.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
