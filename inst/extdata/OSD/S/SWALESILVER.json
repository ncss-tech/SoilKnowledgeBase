  "OVERVIEW": "The Swalesilver series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks and volcanic ash. Swalesilver soils are on depressions on plateaus and lake terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: A revision in 2001 moved the type location from Lake County to Harney County, Oregon to better represent the series concept. The prior type location had high glass content in the A horizons and classified as a vitrandic intergrade. Future study is needed on this soil to document whether enough active ferrous iron occurs in the A horizons, when aquic conditions are present, to give positive reactions to alpha,alpha-dipyridyl.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 15 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).\nAquic conditions - The conditions of episaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between the soil surface and 15 cm at certain times during normal years (A1 and A2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 15 to 58 cm (2Btl and 2Bt2 horizons).\nAbrupt textural change - The abrupt clay increase of more than 20 percent at 15 cm (between the A2 and 2Bt1 horizons).\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 58 to 86 cm (3Bk horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 15 to 58 cm (2Btl and 2Bt2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Previous authors and editors include: TDT-MPK-JVC.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
