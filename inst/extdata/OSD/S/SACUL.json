Annemaine soils have mica flakes in the C horizon and an apparent water tables at 1.5 to 2.5 feet.  Eulonia soils have mica flakes in the B and C horizons and an apparent water table at 1.5 to 3.5 feet.  Beason soils have upper Bt horizons with dominant hues of 10YR or yellower.  Craven, Creedmoor and Wolftever soils have upper Bt horizons with dominant hues of 7.5YR or yellower.  Dogue soils have upper Bt horizons with dominant hues of 7.5YR or yellower and contains mica flakes in the B and C horizons.  Gritney soils, commonly do not have lower B horizons with dominant gray matrix colors and have upper Bt horizons with dominant hues of 10YR or yellower, but both series allow 5YR hues.  Helena soils have upper Bt horizons with dominant hues of 7.5YR or yellower and C horizons of saprolite from a mixture of felsic and mafic crystalline rocks.  Cid, Lignum, Rosenwall, and Vinita soils have sola less than 40 inches thick.   Nemours soils have sola of 50 to more than 72 inches thick and contain mica flakes in the B and C horizons.  Nevarc soils have 30 to 60 inch sola and commonly do not have lower B horizons with dominant gray matrix colors.  Newco soils do not have a water table and formed in sediments of Pleistocene age, which is assumed to have chemical differences.  Peawick soils have sola greater than 60 inches thick and upper Bt horizon with dominant hues of 7.5YR or yellower. Stapp soils contain shale fragments in the lower Bt horizon and Cr horizons of soft, tilted shale."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sacul soils are on nearly level to steep uplands of the Western and Southern Coastal Plains.  Slopes are dominantly 2 to 25 percent but range from 1 to 40 percent.  These soils formed in acid, loamy and clayey sediments of Tertiary Age, mainly in the Claiborne, Jackson and Wilcox formations.  The average annual air temperature ranges from about 60 to 66 degrees F and the average annual precipitation ranges from about 48 to 54 inches."

Angie soils, which occur on less dissected areas, have yellower argillic horizons and the clay content does not decrease by as much as 20 percent within 50 inches of the top of the argillic horizon.  Bowie soils, which occur on less dissected areas, have more than 5 percent plinthite in the lower argillic and are in a fine-loamy particle size class.  Kirvin soils, which occur on similar landscapes, do not have gray mottles in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Saffell soils, which occur on similar landscapes, are in a loamy-skeletal particle size class.  Savannah soils, which occur on broad, less dissected areas, have a fragipan and are in a fine-loamy particle size class.  Smithdale soils, which occur on similar landscapes, are in a fine-loamy particle size class.  Ruston soils, which occur on higher positions on the landscape, are in a fine-loamy particle size class and have a bisequal profile."
