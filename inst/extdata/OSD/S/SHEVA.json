The soil is extremely acid through strongly acid throughout unless the surface has been limed. Rock fragments of sandstone and siltstone range from 0 to 15 percent throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe BE or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It has high and low chroma mottles.  The lower part of the Bt horizon of some pedons is mottled without dominant matrix hue.   The Bt horizon is sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam.\nThe BC horizon, when present, is highly variable in color.  Hue ranges from 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 8.  Some pedons are mottled without dominant matrix hue.  Texture is sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 8, or it is variegated or mottled with no dominant hue.  The C horizon is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 8, or it is variegated or mottled with no dominant hue.  It is highly weathered sandstone or siltstone that crushes to sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils developed in residuum weathered from Triassic materials consisting of sandstone or siltstone.  Mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F near the type location."

Creedmoor soils are on the same landscape position but are deeper to bedrock.  Mayodan soils are well drained on slightly higher landscape positions, and do not have gray mottles in the subsoil. Meadows soils are less than 20 inches to soft bedrock and are on higher landscape positions.  Pinkston soils have a discintinuous argillic horizon.  Spray soils are very deep to bedrock.  Stoneville soils are well drained and deep."
