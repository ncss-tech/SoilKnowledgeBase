  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the loamy mantle ranges from 6 to 20 inches. The particle-size control section has a texture of sand or loamy sand, including less than 50 percent (by weight) very fine sand in the fine-earth fraction. Volume of gravel typically ranges from 3 to 35 percent throughout the soil. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout the soil. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum, but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon, where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum. Masses of iron accumulations are within 40 inches. Saturation occurs within 40 inches at some time in normal years.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. In cultivated areas, the Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam. Bw horizon with spodic colors have pH of 6.0 or greater or organic carbon content of less than 0.6 percent.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 4 to 6. It is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nSpoonerhill soils do not have a glossic horizon, although they do have 2E/B or 2B/E horizons. The 2E part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand. The 2Bt part has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 6. It is loamy sand or the gravelly analogs.\nSome pedons have a 2Bt horizon with the same colors and textures as the 2Bt part described above that do not meet the clay increase requirements of an argillic horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 3 to 6, value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. Texture is sand, loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand. Bulk density ranges from 1.80 to 1.85. The 2C horizon has less than 90 percent sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Spoonerhill soils are on glacial moraines of late Wisconsin Age. Slopes range from 2 to 6 percent. These soils formed in a thin mantle of loamy alluvium and sandy alluvium underlain by sandy till or sandy mudflow sediments on disintegration moraines. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 31 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from about 100 to 130 days. Elevation ranges from 1,000 to 1,300 feet."

The somewhat excessively drained Cress soils and the excessively drained Graycalm and Menahga soils are on adjacent outwash plains. The well drained Fremstadt (T) soils are on higher landscape positions."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Runoff is moderate. Permeability is moderately rapid in the solum and moderate slow in the substratum. Spoonerhill soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 2.5 to 3.5 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period September to June in normal years."

Native vegetation is dominantly deciduous forest with northern red oak, northern pin oak, white oak, white ash, American basswood, quaking aspen, bigtooth aspen, American elm, yellow birch, sugar maple, and black cherry the common species. Some areas are used for cropland or pastureland."
