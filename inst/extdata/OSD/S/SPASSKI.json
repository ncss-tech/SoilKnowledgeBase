Reaction throughout the profile ranges from extremely acid to moderately  acid.  Coarse fragment content in the control section ranges from 0 to 30 percent gravel.\nCombined thickness of the O horizons ranges from 8 to 16 inches.\nAn A horizon may be present on some pedons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue from 5YR to 10YR, value from 2 to 4 and chroma from 1 to 4.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 30 percent gravel.  Mottles may be present.\nThe C horizon has hue from 10YR to 5GB, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is commonly silt loam but ranges to include silty clay loam or silty clay.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 30 percent gravel.  Mottles may be present."
