    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sorrell soils are on mountain slopes of 30 to 75 percent slope.  These soils formed in material weathered mainly from granitic rocks with veins and outcrops of volcanic and metamorphic rocks included.  Elevations are 3,500 to 7,700 feet.  The climate is characterized by having warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 20 inches, some in the form of snow.  The mean January temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F., mean July temperature is 62 to 72 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 46 to 57 degrees F. The frost-free season is 80 to 180 days."

They occur near some ridges and near drainages.  Martee soils are shallow and sandy-skeletal.  They commonly occur near ridge tops and Rock outcrops.  Tollhouse soils are shallow and coarse-loamy.  They occur on mountain slopes, and near Rock outcrop.  Tunis soils are shallow and they occur on south slopes at lower elevations.  Tweedy soils are fine-loamy."
