  "OVERVIEW": "The Sorrell series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes.  These soils formed in material weathered mainly from granitic rocks.  Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
