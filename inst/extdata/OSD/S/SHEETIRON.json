    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 degrees to 54 degrees F; and is usually below 47 degrees F in January and February but is not below 41 degrees F at any time.  The soil between the depths of 9 and 30 inches is usually dry in all parts from early July to late October (about 90 to 110 days) and moist in all parts from December 1 to April 30.  The particle-size control section averages 15 to 25 percent clay.  The very fine sand fraction has 15 to 40 chlorite and mica.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3, 7.5YR 5/4, 2.5Y 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4 or 5/3. Texture is sandy loam or loam with 10 to 25 percent clay and is gravelly, very gravelly or extremely gravelly with 15 to 65 percent pebbles and cobbles.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) is 35 to 60 percent and decreases with depth.  Dry color value of 5 or less and moist value and chroma of 3 or less occur only in the upper 6 inches.\nThe Bw horizon is 10YR 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6 ,6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3, 7/4, 7/6; 2.5Y 6/2, 6/3, 7/2, 7.5YR 5/4 or 5/6.

Texture is sandy loam or loam with 12 to 25 percent clay and is very gravelly or extremely gravelly with 35 to 70 percent rock fragments. Pebbles range from 35 to 55 percent and cobbles range from 5 to 15 percent.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) is 20 to 55 percent.  Thin or moderately thick gray silt and mica coatings and flow deposits are common on peds and in pores.  Some pedons have few thin clay films."

Inskip soils have a large amount of ash and amorphous material and have less than 10 percent clay content.  Mayacama soils have MAST of 54 degrees to 59 degrees F.  Neuns soils have less than 15 percent mica and chlorite.  Terbies soils have a Bs horizon, are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock, and are dry for 45 to 60 days.

    "content": "REMARKS:  As previously recognized, this series contained pedons in both skeletal and non-skeletal families.  Non-skeletal pedons are now excluded.  This is a new type location that is more representative of the series.  There is no change in concept.  After field investigations and a review of lab data, clay content is now restricted to 12 to 25 percent in the control section.  Also the mineralogy class is changed to mixed, based on NSSL data.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to about 8 inches (A1 and A2 horizon).\nCambic horizon - the zone from about 9 to 30 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizon).\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 30 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizon).\nLithic contact - the boundary at about 30 inches."
