  "OVERVIEW": "The Sturgeon series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in silty over sandy alluvium.  Permeability is moderate in the upper loamy material and rapid in the underlying sandy materials. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  This soil ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.  Color, arrangement, and thickness of horizons vary considerably because of the nature of the parent material.  Thickness of the loamy horizons ranges from 16 to 36 inches.\nThe Ap has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Uncultivated areas have an A horizon with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe C horizon above a depth of 36 inches has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Textures include loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, and silt loam.  Thin strata of fine sandy loam or very fine sand are in some pedons.  The underlying 2C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sand or sand.  Thin individual horizons of silty clay loam or sand occur in the upper horizons in places, and loamy materials are below a depth of 40 or 50 inches in some pedons.  High chroma redox concentrations are located throughout the loamy part of the profile."
