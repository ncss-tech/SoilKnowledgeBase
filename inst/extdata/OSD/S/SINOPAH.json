  "OVERVIEW": "The Sinopah series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in decomposed herbaceous plant material and layered volcanic ash. Sinopah soils are on fens within glacial-valley floors. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 750 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C.",

Shrub species such as willows, bog birch, and western Labrador tea are sometimes found near the perimeter of these meadows."
