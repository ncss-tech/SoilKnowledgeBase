  "OVERVIEW": "The Swell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from gypsiferous sandstone and shale.  Swell soils are on backslopes and toeslopes of hills.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
