The depth to coarse textured material ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon has a hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1.  Some pedons have an Ak horizon.  It is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam with a clay range of 35 to 60 percent.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bkg horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam.  Clay ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderatley alkaline.\nThe 2Cg horizon has a hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sand or fine sand.
