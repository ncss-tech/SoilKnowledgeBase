  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to weathered rippable bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  This soil is medium acid or strongly acid and medium or high in phosphate.  Each horizon of the solum contains from 0 to about 15 percent soft and hard rock fragments except the lower part of the horizon contain 5 to 25 percent.   Some pedons have a thin CB or C horizon with up to 50 percent fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or silt loam, except severely eroded areas range to clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon mostly has hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6.  Some pedons have subhorizons with hue of 10YR or 5YR with the same value and chroma.  Mottles in shades of brown and red are none to common.  It is loam or clay loam, except some pedons have thin subhorizons of silt loam, silty clay loam or clay.  Fine and coarse sand exceeds 15 percent in most pedons and sand plus coarse fragments exceeds 15 percent in all pedons.\nThe Cr horizon is dominantly weathered siltstone and fine grained sandstone that is interbedded with shale and limestone.  It is rippable and in most places can be dug with a spade. Most of the rock is relatively soft, but includes some thin strata that is hard.  Some of the strata was calcareous prior to weathering and some strata contains phosphate nodules."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bolivar, Liddieville, Pamunkey, Sandhill and Toine series in the same family and the Armour, Culleoka and Hicks series in similar families.  Bolivar soils have a paralithic contact between 20 and 40 inches.  Liddieville, Pamunkey and Toine soils formed in alluvium on stream terraces and are greater than 60 inches to bedrock.  Sandhill soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the solum.  Armour soils formed in silty alluvium in the upper 2 to 4 feet, are fine-silty and are greater than 60 inches to bedrock. Hicks soils formed in loess in the upper 1.5 to 3 feet and are fine-silty."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stiversville soils are on upland ridgetops and side slopes.  Slopes range from about 2 to 30 percent.  They formed mostly in residuum of siltstone and fine grained sandstone that is interbedded  with limestone and shale.  On steep slopes, some pedons formed partly in colluvium from the same material.  Near the type location, mean annual temperature is 59 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 48 inches."
