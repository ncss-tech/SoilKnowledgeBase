  "OVERVIEW": "The Snakejohn series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy slope alluvium derived from shale and sandstone.  Snakejohn soils are on hillslopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
