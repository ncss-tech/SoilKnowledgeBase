The soils occur at elevations of 250 to 1600 feet.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from various members of the Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG).  The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The average annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches.  The average annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F., average January temperature is 39 to 40 degrees F., and average July temperature is 65 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 165 to 210 days."

Jory soils have a base saturation of less than 35 percent ( by Sum of Cations) in the lower Bt horizons.. Kinton and Cornelius soils have fragipans.  Helvetia soils are on toeslopes and footslopes at lower elevations.  Gelderman, Nekia, and Jory soils are on more stable landforms.
