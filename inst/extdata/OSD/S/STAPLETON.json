  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Stapleton soils typically are noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches but depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Base saturation typically is more than 80 percent and ranges from 60 to 100 percent.  The control section is usually coarse sandy loam, and has 5 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 35 percent silt, and 50 to 80 percent sand with more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.  A large proportion is medium, coarse, and very coarse angular sand which has a high percentage of flat bearing surfaces between sand grains.  Rock fragments range from O to 15 percent and are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter but range from 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter.  The solum and C horizon range from slightly acid through mildly alkaline.  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is 64 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alice, Creighton, Jayem, Phiferson, and Unaweep series.  Alice, Creighton and Phiferson soils are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon and have continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation.  Jayem soils have only small amounts of medium, coarse, and very coarse angular sand and lack hard setting properties.  Unaweep soils have hue of 5YR or redder."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stapleton soils are on gently to moderately steeply sloping alluvial fans and valley side slopes.  Slope gradients range from 1 to 30 or more percent.  The soil formed in alluvial materials derived principally from arkose beds of the Dawson and Arapahoe formations.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 17 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer."
