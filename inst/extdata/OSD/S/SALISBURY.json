  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 8.3 to 10.6 degrees C.  The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 10 and 30 cm for 60 to 115 days following the summer solstice; Xeric moisture regime that borders on aridic.\nDepth to an indurated duripan is 50 to 100 cm. Cobbles and stones are common on the surface and on the breaks to dissected drainages.  Depth to bedrock is over 152 cm.  There is an absolute increase in clay between the A and 2Bt horizons of 15 percent or more.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  It has 15 to 35 percent clay.  It has 0 to 35 percent gravel and 0 to 35 percent cobbles and stones.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 through 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is typically clay or silty clay in the upper part and silty clay loam or clay loam in the lower part.  It has 35 to 55 percent clay.  This horizon has moderate or strong prismatic, or columnar structure in the upper part and ranges to blocky in the lower part.  In some pedons there is a thin horizon of secondary lime immediately above the duripan.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  It has 0 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles and stones.\nThe 3Bqm is indurated in the upper part and is strongly cemented or indurated below.  It ranges from about 60 to 150 cm thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Salisbury soils are on dissected terraces with slopes typically of 0 to 10 percent but range up to 45 percent on escarpments.  Elevations range from 765 to 1,650 meters.  The soils formed in mixed material weathered from metamorphic sediments, rhyolite, tuff, and basalt.  The climate is semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of 300 to 510 mm, a mean annual temperature of 7.2 to 9.4 degrees C., a mean July temperature of 18.9 to 21.170 degrees C., and a mean January temperature of -4.4 to -2.2 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 70 to 140 days."

Drews and Deter soils are on lower terraces.  Lasere soils have bedrock at 50 to 100 cm.  Drewsgap soils are fine-loamy, Oxwall soils are shallow to the duripan and are mapped in complex with the Salisbury series."
