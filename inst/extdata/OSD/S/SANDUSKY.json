  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sandusky soils are on broad, nearly level lake plains near subterranean springs or seepage areas with calcium carbonate charged water. Slope gradients are less than 1 percent. The soils formed in calcareous tufa and other materials impregnated with calcium carbonate. They are underlain by moderately fine textured lacustrine sediments within a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 914 mm (27 to 36 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 190 to 200 days. Elevation is 183 to 191 meters (600 to 625 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Colwood, Gilford, Lenawee, Toledo, and Weyers soils. Colwood and Gilford soils formed in loamy and sandy lacustrine sediments and other water sorted material. They are on similar topographic positions near the edge of the lake plain. Lenawee and Toledo soils lack a mollic epipedon and formed in lacustrine sediments. They are on similar topographic positions but lack the overlying materials formed from calcareous tufa. Weyers soils are underlain by moderately fine textured lacustrine material below a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). They are on similar topographic positions as Sandusky soils but are closer to the subterranean springs."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched water table ranges from the surface to 15 cm (0.5 foot) between November and June in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the materials weathered from tufa and moderately low in the underlying lacustrine sediments. Permeability is moderately rapid in the materials weathered from tufa and moderately slow or slow in the underlying lacustrine sediments."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (Ap horizon).\nAquic conditions: throughout the profile.\nSandusky soils do not have a calcic horizon because there are no horizons enriched by secondary carbonates. The high chroma in subhorizons of Sandusky soils is inherited from the parent material. These soils appear to have an irregular decrease in organic carbon but are on lake plains and do not receive stream overflow. The darker layers have been buried by an accumulation of calcareous tufa. Sandusky soils were formerly identified as a variant of the Warners series.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to the laboratory data and engineering test data for pedon SN-19, the typical pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
