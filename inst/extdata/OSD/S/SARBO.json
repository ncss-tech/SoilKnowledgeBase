  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sarbo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  They have sands and gravel at moderate depths.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, and glacial outwash plains. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
