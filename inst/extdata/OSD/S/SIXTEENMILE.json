  "REVDATE": "10/2013",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sixteenmile series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or residuum from hard sedimentary bedrock.  These soils are on escarpments and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 400 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
