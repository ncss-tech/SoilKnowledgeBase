  "OVERVIEW": "The Signal series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in old alluvium weathered primarily from igneous rock. Signal soils are on old dissected alluvial fans and valley slopes and have slopes of 1 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is approximately 14 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This revision of the Signal series changes the classification and type location. The previous type location was in the soil survey of Santa Cruz and parts of Cochise and Pima Counties, Arizona. At that location the soils were marginal between fine and clayey-skeletal.  Additional field observations indicated that the soils would be dominantly clayey-skeletal. The new type location better represents a clayey-skeletal family and the area of distribution.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
