The climate is semiarid and warm.  Summers are hot and winters are cool. The average January temperature is 48 degrees F. The average July temperature is 80 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 57 degrees to 69 degrees F. The frost-free season is 180 to 260 days. The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches and occurs mainly as thunderstorms in July and August and as gentle rains in December and January."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This revision of the Signal series changes the classification and type location. The previous type location was in the soil survey of Santa Cruz and parts of Cochise and Pima Counties, Arizona. At that location the soils were marginal between fine and clayey-skeletal.  Additional field observations indicated that the soils would be dominantly clayey-skeletal. The new type location better represents a clayey-skeletal family and the area of distribution.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
