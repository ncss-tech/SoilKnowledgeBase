Annum soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact and are dry for more than 90 consecutive days. Boyleston and Mendian soils have a mantle of loess, have buried Bt horizons, and are dry for more than 90 consecutive days. Brownlee soils do not have O horizons, are typically 40 to 60 inches deep over weathered granite, and have few to common lamellae in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Chirpchatter soils are dry 120 to 140 days. Lompico, Lorena, Meland, Robbscreek and Stacker soils are 20 to 40 inches deep. Dryfalls soils are 40 to 60 inches deep and are influenced by ash in the upper 7 to 14 inches. Ebadlow soils are dry 90 to 105 days and are moderately deep to skeletal material. Felton soils have more than 50 percent shale fragments in the C horizons and are dry for more than 90 consecutive days. Fisherhill soils are dry 90 to 105 days and have an average annual soil temperature of 52 to 54 degrees F. Goldendale and Meystre soils have less than 5 percent rock fragments and less than 25 percent medium sand or coarser in the particle-size control section. Hellake soils are less than 45 inches deep to the base of the Bt horizon, have less than 25 percent medium and coarser sand, and have a substratum discontinuity. Quiden soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 50 to 54 degrees F and have less than 25 percent medium and coarser sand. Rehfield soils are dry for more than 90 consecutive days, and are 40 to more than 60 inches deep to bedrock. Schumacher soils have less than 25 percent medium or coarser sand in the particle-size control section, are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days, and are 40 to 60 inches deep to lithic bedrock. Updegraff soils are dry more than 90 consecutive days and are 40 to 60 inches deep. Van Horn soils have an average annual soil temperature 51 to 54 degrees F.  Alderpoint soils are not currently in the database and cannot be competed."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Stardust soils are nearly level to moderately steep on fan remnants and landslides at elevations of 2,700 to 5,000 feet. These soils formed in alluvium from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent. Average annual precipitation is 20 to 26 inches. Average annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F. Frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

Cloudyway soils are coarse-loamy, do not have an argillic horizon and occur on similar geomorphic positions. Huston soils are loamy-skeletal and occur on fan remnant escarpments. Riverpoint soils are loamy-skeletal and occur on small splays. Hellake soils are on relict lakebed terraces and landslides."
