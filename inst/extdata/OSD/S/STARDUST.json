  "OVERVIEW": "The Stardust series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderate permeability that formed in alluvium from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent in mountain valleys and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the average annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

Annum soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact and are dry for more than 90 consecutive days. Boyleston and Mendian soils have a mantle of loess, have buried Bt horizons, and are dry for more than 90 consecutive days. Brownlee soils do not have O horizons, are typically 40 to 60 inches deep over weathered granite, and have few to common lamellae in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Chirpchatter soils are dry 120 to 140 days. Lompico, Lorena, Meland, Robbscreek and Stacker soils are 20 to 40 inches deep. Dryfalls soils are 40 to 60 inches deep and are influenced by ash in the upper 7 to 14 inches. Ebadlow soils are dry 90 to 105 days and are moderately deep to skeletal material. Felton soils have more than 50 percent shale fragments in the C horizons and are dry for more than 90 consecutive days. Fisherhill soils are dry 90 to 105 days and have an average annual soil temperature of 52 to 54 degrees F. Goldendale and Meystre soils have less than 5 percent rock fragments and less than 25 percent medium sand or coarser in the particle-size control section. Hellake soils are less than 45 inches deep to the base of the Bt horizon, have less than 25 percent medium and coarser sand, and have a substratum discontinuity.

Riverpoint soils are loamy-skeletal and occur on small splays. Hellake soils are on relict lakebed terraces and landslides."
