  "OVERVIEW": "The Shorthair series consists of well drained, sodic soils which are shallow to sandstone.  Shorthair soils formed in alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone on footslopes and structural benches of valley sides.  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
