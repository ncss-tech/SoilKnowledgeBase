Elevations range from 1,158 to 1,463 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual soil temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 110 to 160 days."

East Fork soils are fine-loamy and have mollic epipedons.  Fallon soils are coarse-loamy.  Fernley soils are sandy and do not have loamy strata in the particle-size control section."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (Ap and part of the C1 horizons).\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates - The zones from 53 to 86 cm and 109 to 152 cm (Ck1, 2Ck2, and 4Ck3 horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 91 to 152 cm at certain times in normal years (parts of the 3C' and 4Ck3 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Ck1 and 2Ck2 horizons and parts of the C and 3C' horizons).\nThe revision of March 2000 restricted the series concept to the warmer, drier portion of the climatic range within MLRA 27 and updated the taxonomic subgroup from Aquic Xerofluvents to Oxyaquic Torrifluvents.  Sagouspe soils previously correlated in MLRA 26, in Storey County and Washoe County, Nevada, may be within the range of the Carwalker series.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  A pedon of Sagouspe has full characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE as user pedon ID 99NV001001 (pedon # 00P0239).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
