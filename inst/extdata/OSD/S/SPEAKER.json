  "OVERVIEW": "The Speaker series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  Speaker soils are on low rolling foot slopes and side slopes and have gradients of 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Depth to a paralithic contact and thickness of the solum range from 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 0 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, 25 to 35 percent clay, and more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser but less than 15 percent coarse and very coarse sand.  Clean sand and silt coatings are common on faces of peds in the upper part of the B horizon in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 6 moist and dry.  Rock fragments averages 5 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Reaction is strongly to slightly acid.  The horizon has 2 to 4 percent organic matter.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  Textures are gravelly clay loam, clay loam, gravelly loam or loam.  There are few to common moderately thick clay films.  Stonelines are in some pedons.  Reaction is very strongly to moderately acid."

The soils formed in moderately fine textured colluvium weathered from sedimentary and volcanic sandstone, conglomerate sandstone and metavolcanic rocks. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist with an average annual precipitation of 30 to 60 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 56 degrees F.
