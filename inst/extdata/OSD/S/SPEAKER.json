  "OVERVIEW": "The Speaker series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  Speaker soils are on low rolling foot slopes and side slopes and have gradients of 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches (1140 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F (10 degrees C).",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F (8 to 12 degrees C).  The soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches (5 to 30 cm) for 60 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Depth to a paralithic contact and thickness of the solum range from 20 to 40 inches (50 to 100 cm).  The particle-size control section averages 0 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, 25 to 35 percent clay, and more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser but less than 15 percent coarse and very coarse sand.  Clean sand and silt coatings are common on faces of peds in the upper part of the B horizon in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 6 moist and dry.  Rock fragments average 5 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Reaction is strongly to slightly acid.  The horizon has 2 to 4 percent organic matter.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  Textures are gravelly clay loam, clay loam, gravelly loam or loam.  There are few to common, moderately thick clay films.  Stone lines are in some pedons.  Reaction is very strongly to moderately acid."

Bigridge and Cohasset soils have a paralithic contact between 100 and 150 cm.  Holland, Hospiter, Pasturerock, and Sitton soils are very deep.  Hotaw soils formed in granodiorite and are dry from about June to October (about 120 days), and have a mean soil temperature of 11 to 15 degrees C.  Millerridge soils formed in ultramafic rock and have significant amounts of Magnesium-rich minerals, and have a mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 15 degrees C.  Minniecreek soils are dry in all parts from about June to October (about 120 days) and have a mean annual soil temperature of 13 to 14 degrees C.  Willakenzie soils formed in tuffaceous sandstone and are dry for 45 to 60 days following the summer solstice."

The soils formed in moderately fine textured colluvium weathered from sedimentary and volcanic sandstone, conglomerate sandstone and metavolcanic rocks. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist with an average annual precipitation of 30 to 60 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 56 degrees F (7 to 13 degrees C).
