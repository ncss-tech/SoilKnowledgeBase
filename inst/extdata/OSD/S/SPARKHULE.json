  "OVERVIEW": "The Sparkhule series consists of shallow to rock, well drained soils that formed in residuum from volcanic or granitic rocks. Sparkhule soils are on rock pediments and hills and have slopes of 5 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F.",

Elevations are 2,300 to 4,500 feet.  The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool, slightly moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches, most of the moisture falls as rain in the winter with a few inches occasionally as snow. The average January temperature is 46 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 84 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 61 to 65 degrees F. The frost-free season is 200 to 255 days."
