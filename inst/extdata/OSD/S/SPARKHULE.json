  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sparkhule soils are on rock pediments and hills and have slopes of 5 to 50 percent. They formed in residuum from basalt, andesite, dacite or granite. Elevations are 2,300 to 4,500 feet.  The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool, slightly moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches, most of the moisture falls as rain in the winter with a few inches occasionally as snow. The average January temperature is 46 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 84 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 61 to 65 degrees F. The frost-free season is 200 to 255 days."
