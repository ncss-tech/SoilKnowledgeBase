The mollic epipedon commonly is between 25 and 41 cm (10 and 16 inches) in thickness but ranges from 23 to 61 cm (8 to 24 inches). The 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 inch) particle size control section averages between 35 and 45 percent clay. Content of fine sand and coarser ranges from 15 to 30 percent. The lower part of the series control section has bulk density of 1.6 to 1.8 gm/cc. Gravel size rock fragments from 1 to 5 percent throughout. Cobble size rock fragments range from 0 to 4 percent throughout. The rock fragments are of mixed lithology. Shale is a common component.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is clay loam, clay, silty clay or silty clay loam. Clay content ranges from 35 to 50 percent. It is neutral to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. Ped exteriors have organic matter coatings that range from common to many and typically are 1 unit or more lower in chroma than ped interiors. Some pedons have few to common redox features in the lower part of the horizon. It is clay loam, clay or silty clay. Clay content commonly ranges from 35 to 50 percent clay and content of sand from 20 to 35 percent. It is moderately acid to neutral. Some pedons have a Bt horizon that does not qualify for an argillic horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 or 4. Redox features with chroma of 2 or less are few to common. It is clay loam or clay. The content of clay ranges from 30 to 45 percent and content of sand ranges from 15 to 35 percent. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 or 4. Redox features with chroma of 2 or less are few to common. It is clay loam. The content of clay ranges from 30 to 45 percent and content of sand ranges from 15 to 35 percent. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 or 4. Redox features with chroma of 2 or less are few to common.

The poorly drained Cosmos soils are on nearly level lower lying positions on the landscape. The poorly drained Danielson soils are on footslopes. The somewhat poorly drained Kandiyohi soils are on summits. The poorly drained Danielson soils are on footslopes."
