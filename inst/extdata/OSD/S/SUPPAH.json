    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually dry and are dry in all parts of the moisture control section more than half the time (cumulative) that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F.  Solum thickness and depth to fragmental pumice is 20 to 40 inches.  The upper part of the solum averages 5 to 15 percent clay, 45 to 80 percent pumice, 30 to 50 percent volcanic glass in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction, 0.2 to 0.4 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, and 8 to 10 percent 15-bar water retention (air-dried sample).  Organic matter is 1 to 2 percent in the upper 10 inches of the solum.  Soil reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 45 to 55 percent pumice gravel and 5 to 15 percent 0.5mm to 2.0mm pumice.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is ashy sandy loam or ashy loamy sand.  It contains 45 to 80 percent pumice gravel and 10 to 20 percent 0.5mm to 2.0mm pumice.\nThe C horizon has value of 7 or 8 moist and dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is fragmental pumice with less than 10 percent (by volume) particles less than 2.0 mm diameter."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Suppah soils are on strongly sloping to moderately steep south-facing foot slopes of canyons.  The soil formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from volcanic ash and pumice. Slopes are 12 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1600 to 2800 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool and moist winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 160 days."
