  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to hard rock ranges from 20 to 34 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 61 degrees to 64 degrees F. and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F. at any time.  The soil between depths of 4 and 12 inches is usually moist in some or all parts from about December 1 until late May and is continuously dry the rest of the time.  The A1 horizon is pale brown, light yellowish brown or very pale brown (10YR 6/3, 6/4, 7/4) silt loam or loam and is slightly or medium acid.  In some pedons the A2 horizon is discontinuous.  The B2t horizon is yellowish brown, strong brown, reddish brown or yellowish red (10YR 5/4); 7.5YR 5/6; 5YR 5/3, 5/4, 4/4, 4/6, 5/6) clay loam, silty clay loam or clay and has 35 to 45 percent clay.  It is slightly acid to very strongly acid.  The A-B2t horizon boundary is abrupt and the absolute clay increase is greater than 15 percent.  Exchangeable sodium percentage in all parts of the B2t horizon is 15 to 25."
