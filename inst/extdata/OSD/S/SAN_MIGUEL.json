  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to hard rock ranges from 20 to 34 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 61 degrees to 64 degrees F. and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F. at any time.  The soil between depths of 4 and 12 inches is usually moist in some or all parts from about December 1 until late May and is continuously dry the rest of the time.  The A1 horizon is pale brown, light yellowish brown or very pale brown (10YR 6/3, 6/4, 7/4) silt loam or loam and is slightly or medium acid.  In some pedons the A2 horizon is discontinuous.  The B2t horizon is yellowish brown, strong brown, reddish brown or yellowish red (10YR 5/4); 7.5YR 5/6; 5YR 5/3, 5/4, 4/4, 4/6, 5/6) clay loam, silty clay loam or clay and has 35 to 45 percent clay.  It is slightly acid to very strongly acid.  The A-B2t horizon boundary is abrupt and the absolute clay increase is greater than 15 percent.  Exchangeable sodium percentage in all parts of the B2t horizon is 15 to 25."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The San Miguel soils are strongly sloping to very steep and are in mountainous areas at elevations of 700 to 3,300 feet.  The soils formed in residuum weathered from metavolcanic rocks.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 18 inches.  The average January temperature is about 48 degrees F., average July temperature is about 75 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 240 to 280 days."
