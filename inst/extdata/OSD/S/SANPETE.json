    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sanpete soils occur on alluvial fans, alluvial flats, foothills, ballenas, fan remnants, fan skirts and inset fans. Slope range is 1 to 60 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone, sandstone, shale, and igneous rock. These soils occur at elevations of 1,520 to 2,180 meters. The climate is semiarid to dry subhumid with a mean annual air temperature of about 7 to 11 degrees C., mean summer temperature of about 18 to 20 degrees C. and average annual precipitation is about 200 to 300 mm. The freeze-free period ranges from 100 to 140 days."
