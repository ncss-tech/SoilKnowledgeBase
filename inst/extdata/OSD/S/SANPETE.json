  "OVERVIEW": "The Sanpete series consists of very deep, well to somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from limestone, sandstone, shale, and  igneous rock. Sanpete soils are on alluvial fans, ballenas, inset fans, fan remnants and alluvial plains and have slopes of 1 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 275 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
