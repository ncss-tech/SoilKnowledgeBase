  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to limestone bedrock are greater than 60 inches. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid except where limed. Average content of coarse fragments ranges between l5 and 35 percent in the solum. Transition horizons have colors and texture similar to adjacent horizons.\nThe A and Ap horizons have hue of l0YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. In some pedons, this horizon has brownish mottles. Texture is commonly gravelly silt loam or gravelly loam, but the range allows silt loam and loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of l0YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Some pedons have brownish mottles. Texture is gravelly silt loam or gravelly loam.\nThe Btl horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6. Most pedons have mottles in shades of brown and red. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons have hue of 5YR, 2.5YR, or 10R value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8. Most pedons have mottles in shades of brown, yellow, and red. Some pedons have a few mottles in shades of gray or white below 40 inches. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silty clay or clay."

Bewleyville and Mountview soils, on adjacent smoother landscapes, are fine-silty. Dickson soils, on broad undulating ridges, have a fragipan.  Nolin soils, on nearby flood plains, are fine-silty. Hawthorne, Sugargrove, and Sulphura soils, on similar positions, are loamy and less than 60 inches deep to rock."
