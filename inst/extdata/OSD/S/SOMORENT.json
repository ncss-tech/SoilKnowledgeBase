  "OVERVIEW": "The Somorent series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, eolian sand, and local residuum derived from the Morrison and Entrada formations. Somorent soils are on hillslopes on escarpments and structural benches. Slopes range from 15 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 54\ndegrees F.",

Birdsley soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Celeton soils formed in residuum weathered from diatomite and have 60 to 80 percent pararock fragments of diatomite.  Goldyke soils have hard bedrock within 40 inches of the soil surface. Perlor and Oceanet soils have mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 52 degrees F. Roic soils have a mean annual precipitation range of 4 to 6 inches and a frost-free period of 120 to 150 days. Slatery soils have a frost free period of 100 to 130 days, have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments after wetting, and 35 to 50 percent rock fragments before wetting in the particle size control section."
