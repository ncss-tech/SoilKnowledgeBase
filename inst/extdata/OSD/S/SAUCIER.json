  "STATES": "AL,LA,MS",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Saucier series consists of moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that have a moderate amount of plinthite in the subsoil.  These soils formed in marine sediment that is loamy in the upper part and clayey in the lower part.  These are nearly level to strongly sloping soils on upland ridges and hillsides of the Southern Coastal Plain and Eastern Gulf Coast Flatwoods.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to as much as 80 inches or more.  Iron concretions, up to 2.5 centimeters in diameter, if present, are few to as much as 5 to 15 percent by volume.  Within the depth between 20 and 45 inches, plinthite makes up from 5 to 25 percent of the volume of one or more horizons.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in all horizons, except the surface layer in areas that have been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3, or hue of 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, chroma of 2.  Some pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A horizon and E horizon are sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe BA horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It has the same texture range as the A horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 to 8, or it is mottled in shades of brown, yellow, gray, or red.  Mottles having chroma of 2 or less are within a depth of 30 inches from the surface.  Texture is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon has from 20 to 35 percent clay and from 20 to 45 percent silt.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has the range in texture as the upper part but, in addition, includes silty clay loam.  Fine to medium concretions, if present, are few to common.\nThe 2Bt horizon commonly is mottled in various shades of  brown, yellow, gray, or red, and less commonly it has a matrix with few to many mottles of these colors.  The 2Bt horizon is clay loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay."

Clarendon soils have 5 to 15 percent silt in the control section.  Kirbyville soils have tonguing of the E horizon into the Bt horizon.  Robertsdale soils have a matrix color in chroma of 2 or less within a depth of 20 inches of the surface and are somewhat poorly drained.  Ardilla and Basin soils have fragic properties.  In addition Basin is coarse-loamy.  Baxterville, Bowie, Dothan, and Malbis soils do not have mottles with chroma of 2 or less within a depth of 30 inches from the surface.  Beauregard soils have a fine-silty control section.  Escambia and Harleston soils have a coarse-loamy control section.  In addition Harleston has less than 5 percent plinthite."

Harleston soils, which are moderately well drained, are on low ridges.  Malbis soils, which are well drained or moderately well drained, mainly are in higher positions on slopes and ridgecrests.  Poarch soils, which are well drained or moderately well drained and have a coarse-loamy particle-size class, are on broader slopes.  Susquehanna soils, which are somewhat poorly drained and have a fine particle-size class, are on steeper slopes and in similar positions as the Saucier soils."
