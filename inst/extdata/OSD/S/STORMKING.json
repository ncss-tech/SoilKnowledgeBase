  "OVERVIEW": "The Stormking series consists of deep and very deep to fractured hard bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from marine basalt and associated volcanic rocks on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 20 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 75 inches and average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
