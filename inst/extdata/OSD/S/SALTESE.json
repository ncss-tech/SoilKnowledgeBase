  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Organic material ranges in thickness from 51 inches to more than 10 feet. Depth to discontinuous thin layers or lenses of limnic materials mixed with volcanic ash varies from 8 inches to 51 inches. The mean annual soil temperature at a 20 inch depth is 47 to 54 degrees F. These soils are mostly decomposed materials from reeds, sedges, cattails, and grasses. The control section is sapric material with an unrubbed fiber content of 5 to 75 percent and a rubbed fiber content of 1 to 10 percent. The limnic materials are lenses of diatomacious earth mixed with volcanic ash and combined thickness is less than 2 inches. The limnic materials have value of 6 to 8 dry,  4 or 5 moist and chroma of 1 dry, 1 or 2 moist.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR, 2.5Y, 10YR, or is neutral, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is very strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the upper part and moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part."

Carlisle, Catden, Houghton, Lena, and Peteetneet soils lack lenses of diatomaceous earth and volcanic ash. Carlisle and Catden soils have woody fragments throughout. Lena soils are calcareous in all tiers. Peteetneet soils have a 10YR hue and a moist chroma of 2 below a depth of 7 inches. Semiahmoo soils are strongly acid or very strongly acid through the subsurface tiers."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are in lake basins, potholes, river valleys, around the perimeter of lakes, on glacial till plains, outwash plains, and in the channeled scablands. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. Elevation ranges from 1,050 to 2,500 feet. The soils formed in decomposed remains of reeds, sedges, and other plants with some diatomite and volcanic ash. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is mostly 18 to 25 inches but is as little as 7 inches in the warm phase. The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F., 30 degrees F. in warm phase. The mean July temperature is about 67 degrees F., 72 degrees F. in warm phase. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F., 48 to 52 degrees F. in the warm phase. The frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."
