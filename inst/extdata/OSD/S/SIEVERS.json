  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sievers series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity slowly (moderately permeable) soils that formed from predominantly loamy materials dredged from rivers, bays, canals, and bayous. These gently sloping soils occur on flats in coastal areas. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1397 mm (55 in),and mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F).",
