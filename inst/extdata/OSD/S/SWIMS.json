  "OVERVIEW": "The Swims series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium derived from argillite, quartzite, and dolomitic limestone from the Belt formation.  These soils are on high bottma lands and low terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 7 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
