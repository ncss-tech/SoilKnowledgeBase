These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuff , andesite, quartzite, conglomerate and rhyolite. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1,860 to 2,750 meters. The climate is cool and semi-arid. Mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C, and frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
