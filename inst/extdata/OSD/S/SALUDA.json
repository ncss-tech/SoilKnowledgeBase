  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to paralithic contact is 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to hard rock is greater than 40 inches.  Coarse fragments of gravel to boulder size range to as much as 35 percent in the A horizon and to 20 percent in the B horizon.  The soil is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the stony analogues of these textures.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Some pedons have a thin BA or BC horizon of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam with colors like the Bt horizon.\nThe Cr horizon is variable in color.  It is saprolite of weathered granite, gneiss, or schist."

Similar series in other families are the Ashe, Chandler, Chester, Edneyville, Fannin, Hartsells, Talladega, Tate, and Watauga series.  Ashe and Chandler soils lack Bt horizons. Chester, Edneyville, Fannin, Hartsells, Tate, and Watauga soils have sola more than 20 inches thick.  Talladega soils have A and B horizons with more than 35 percent coarse fragments."

Slopes are dominantly 25 to 90 percent, but range from 10 to 90 percent.  Annual precipitation ranges from about 55 to 80 inches.  The soil formed in weathered granite, gneiss, or schist.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 50 degrees to 57 degrees F."
