  "OVERVIEW": "The Sycomat series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. The Sycomat soils are on axial stream terraces, drainageways, stream terraces, fan skirts, and fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
