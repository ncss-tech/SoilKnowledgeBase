Ballard, Bohna, Chualar, Chuloak, Havala, Pinto and Tehachapi soils are deep and lack a paralithic contact.  Foothill soils are dry from about June 1 to November 1 (140 to 160 days) and have granitic parent material.  .Franciscan soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact  Gilroy soils have a lithic contact. Los Gatos soils have a lithic contact and a mesic temperature regime. Los Osos soils have a fine textural control section.  Soper soils have an argillic horizon that contains 15 to 35percent by volume gravel or cobbles."

Elevations are 700 to 2,500 feet. The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 24 inches. Average January temperature is about 46 F., the average July temperature is about 71 F., and the mean annual temperature is about 57 F to 61 F.
