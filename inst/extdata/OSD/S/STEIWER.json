The soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches from 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Thickness of the solum and depth to a paralithic contact range from 20 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches. The soil has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay. It has 0 to 5 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent paragravel. Reaction is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe AB or BA horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam or clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay. It has 0 to 5 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent paragravel. Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. Texture is clay loam or silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles. It has 0 to 20 percent paragravel in the upper part and 0 to 35 percent paragravel in the lower part. Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Steiwer soils occur on hills and formed in loamy colluvium derived from sedimentary bedrock and mixed with glaciolacustrine deposits at elevations below 400 feet. Some pedons overlie partially consolidated igneous bedrock. Elevation is 250 to 1,200 feet. Slopes are 3 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean July temperature is 66 to 68 degrees F, mean January temperature is 39 degrees F, and mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. The frost-free period is 165 to 210 days."

Chehulpum soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to sedimentary bedrock and are on the convex parts of the hillslope. Dupee soils are greater than 40 inches to a paralithic contact and are on\nfootslopes and concave parts of the hillslopes. Hazelair and Helmick soils are very fine, have redox depletions within 30 inches of the surface and are on less convex parts of the hillslope. Willakenzie soils have an argillic horizondo not have a mollic epipedon and are on low hills. Yamhill soils are fine textured, have a mollic epipedon thicker than 20 inches and occur over basalt on hills."
