    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the mineral solum and depth to bedrock from the mineral soil surface ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 35 percent by volume throughout the mineral solum. Stones and boulders cover from .01 to 15 percent of the surface. Reaction ranges from ultra acid to very strongly acid in the surface and subsurface horizons, and from extremely acid to strongly acid in the subsoil.\nThe O horizons have hue of 10R to 10YR or are neutral, with value and chroma of 3 or less. It is fribric, hemic, or sapric material. It has weak or moderate, fine or medium granular or subangular blocky structure. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, fine sand, sand, or coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak fine or medium granular or subangular blocky structure, or are single grain. Consistence is very friable, friable, or loose.\nThe Bhs horizons and Bh horizons (where present), have hue of 10R to 7.5YR, with value and chroma of 3 or less. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, fine sand, sand, or coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. They have weak or moderate, fine, medium, or coarse granular or subangular blocky structure, or are single grain. Consistence is very friable, friable, or loose. It is moderately or strongly smeary.\nSome pedons have a Bs horizon that has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand or coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. They have weak or moderate, fine, medium, or coarse subangular blocky structure, or are single grain. Consistence is very friable, friable, or loose.\nBedrock is anorthositic gneiss (metamorphosed anorthosite)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Skylight soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of mountains and ridges at elevations greater than 3000 feet. Slope ranges from 3 to 80 percent. The soils formed in a thin mantle of sandy material over bedrock. In some pedons this mantle is till, and in other pedons it is residuum derived from the underlying anorthositic gneiss bedrock. In very steep areas, the mineral soil material is colluvium which moved from unstable positions up slope. The mean annual temperature ranges from 30 to 43 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 80 inches. The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 110 days. Elevations range from 3000 to 5400 feet above mean sea level."

Couchsachraga (T) soils occupy similar landscape positions and have mineral soil horizons less than 10 inches thick over bedrock. Ricker soils are thin organic soils on landforms similar to those of Skylight soils. Esther (T) and Wallface (T) soils occupy less sloping, more stable parts of the landscape, are coarse-loamy, and are very deep and moderately deep to bedrock respectively. Santanoni (T) soils are also on similar topographic positions, but are moderately deep to bedrock."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Some pedons have enough andic soil properties to key out as Andic Humicryods if they did not key out as Lithic first, and some pedons lacking E horizons will key out as Lithic Haplocryands. These are similar soils in use and management to the Lithic Humicryods concept.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\na. Albic horizon - from 5 to 9 inches (E horizon).\nb. Spodic horizon - from 9 to 15 inches (Bhs horizon).\nc. Humic great group - have 6 percent or more organic carbon throughout a layer 4 inches or more thick within the spodic horizon.\nd. Lithic subgroup - bedrock within 20 inches of the mineral soil surface (R horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL laboratory data is available for the following pedon: S93-NY-031-004.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
