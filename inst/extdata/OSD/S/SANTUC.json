  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. The soil is extremely acid to strongly acid. Content of quartz gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent by volume in the A and E horizons and from 0 to 5 percent in the B and C horizons. Flakes of mica range from none to a few in the Bt and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, coarse sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, coarse sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. In some pedons, the lower Bt horizon has masses of oxidized iron in shades of yellow, brown, or red. Iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less are in the upper 24 inches of the Bt horizon. The texture is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam, and includes clay in the lower part.\nThe BC or CB horizon (where present) has hue of 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Masses of oxidized iron are in shades of yellow, brown, or red and iron depletions are in shades of gray. The texture is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is typically variegated in shades of gray, yellow, or brown. The C horizon is sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam saprolite."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Abell, Altavista, Bertie, Tetotum, and Winton series in the same family, and the Bush River, Helena, and Prosperity series in similar families. Abell soils have a lithologic discontinuity within a depth of 48 inches. Altavista soils are on stream terraces, formed in fluvial sediment, and have an apparent water table. Bertie soils are on the lower coastal plain, formed in marine sediment, and have an apparent water table. Winton soils are on steep bluffs of terraces and formed in fluvial or marine sediment. Bush River, Helena, and Prosperity soils have a clayey particle-size control section. In addition, Bush River and Prosperity soils have a paralithic contact within 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Santuc soils are on broad ridges, side slopes, toe slopes and at the heads of small drainageways of the Piedmont uplands. There is a perched water table in late winter and early spring. Slope ranges from 2 to 15 percent. The soil formed in residuum weathered from mixed acid crystalline rocks such as granite or granite gneiss. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 44 to 48 inches, mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 62 degrees F, and the frost-free season ranges from 210 to 230 days."
