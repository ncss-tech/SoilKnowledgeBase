  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Stones range from 0 through 5 percent by volume in the A horizon and upper part of the C horizon and are absent in the lower part of the C horizon. Cobbles range from 0 through 10 percent in the A horizon, 0 through 5 percent in the upper part of the C horizon, and are absent in the lower part of the C horizon. Gravel ranges from 0 through 10 percent by volume in the A horizon, 0 through 20 percent in the upper part of the C horizon to a depth of 30 inches (76 centimeters), and 0 through 50 percent in the C horizon below a depth of 30 inches (76 centimeters). Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid in the A horizon and upper part of the C horizon, and from very strongly acid through neutral in the lower part of the C horizon.\nThe O horizon is commonly mucky peat or muck, but the range includes thin layers of peat at the surface. The O horizon is neutral or has hue 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 3.\nThe A horizon where present is neutral or has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 0 through 2. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, sand or their mucky analogues in the fine-earth fraction. This horizon commonly is 5 through 14 inches (13 through 36 centimeters) thick, but in some places may be less than 5 inches (13 centimeters) thick or absent.\nThe upper part of the Cg horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 3. Some pedons have few or common fine through coarse redoximorphic features. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe lower part of the C horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR through 5Y or 5GY, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 4. Redoximorphic features range from none through many and are fine through coarse. Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, or coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. The C horizon is structureless and loose, very friable, or friable. It is often stratified."

Ackerman soils are more alkaline in the organic horizons and the upper part of the C horizon. They also contain coprogenous material. Antung soils are more alkaline and effervesce in the C horizon."

The use of the Scarboro series in Maine, and in MLRA 144B, is relict to before temperature classes. These have been removed from the SC file.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Histic epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 8 inches (20 centimeters), (Oi and Oa horizons).\n2. Thickness of organic soil materials is 8 inches (20 centimeters).\n3. Aquic conditions - Histic epipedon or the zone from 19 to 22 inches (48 to 56 centimeters) has 50 percent or more 2 chroma with redox concentrations (Cg2 horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
