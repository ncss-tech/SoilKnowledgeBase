Carr and Rocher soils have particle-size control sections in which the sand is dominantly fine sand or very fine sand, respectively. In addition, Carr soils have a drier moisture regime borderline to ustic. Stringley soils have 15 percent or more gravel in the lower part of the series control section and have a seasonal high water table within a depth of 183 cm (6 feet)."

Genesee, Gessie, and Ross soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections and are on slightly higher positions. Landes and Lanier soils have mollic epipedons and are on similar landscapes.
