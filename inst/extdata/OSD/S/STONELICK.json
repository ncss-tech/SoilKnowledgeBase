  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Carr, Rocher, and Stringley series. Carr and Rocher soils have particle-size control sections in which the sand is dominantly fine sand or very fine sand, respectively. In addition, Carr soils have a drier moisture regime borderline to ustic. Stringley soils have 15 percent or more gravel in the lower part of the series control section and have a seasonal high water table within a depth of 183 cm (6 feet)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Stonelick soils are on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in calcareous stratified alluvium that has its source in areas of Wisconsinan glaciation. Climate is humid and temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1016 mm (35 to 40 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 210 days. Elevation is 160 to 235 meters (525 to 770 feet) above mean sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Eel, Genesee, Gessie, Landes, Lanier, Medway, Ross, Shoals, Sligo, and Sloan soils. Eel, Medway, and Sligo soils are moderately well drained and are in slightly lower positions. Genesee, Gessie, and Ross soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections and are on slightly higher positions. Landes and Lanier soils have mollic epipedons and are on similar landscapes. Shoals soils are somewhat poorly drained and Sloan soils are very poorly drained and are in depressional areas."
