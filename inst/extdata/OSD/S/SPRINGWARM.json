  "OVERVIEW": "The Springwarm series consists of moderately deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with spring deposited travertine.  The Springwarm soils are on alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
