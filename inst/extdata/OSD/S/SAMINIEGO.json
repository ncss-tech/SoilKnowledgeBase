  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Saminiego soils are on stream terraces of Holocene Age.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The soils formed in fine textured stream alluvium underlain by moderately fine silty-textured alluvium at depths of about 30 inches.  The alluvium is derived form acid and basic igneous rocks; granite, schist, rhyolite, andesite, quartzite, limestone and basalt.  Elevations are 1100 to 2200 feet.  The climate is hot, arid continental.  Average annual precipitation is 4 to 10 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 67 to 75 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 240 to 350 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nFluventic subgroup placement is based on the assumption that an irregular decrease in content of organic carbon occurs below 25 cm.  NASIS data and the publication record that rare flooding conditions exist.\nCambic horizon - The zone from about 2 to 28 inches.\nOrganic matter - More than 1 percent throughout.  Horizons not considered part of mollic epipedon because they do not meet the moisture requirements.\nContrasting textures - The difference in clay between upper and lower stories meets the minimum required - 25 percent.\nThe Keys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003 removed the strongly contrasting particle-size class Clayey over fine-silty. The classification was changed to Clayey over loamy in 2006.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
