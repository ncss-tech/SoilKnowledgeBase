The soils formed in fine textured stream alluvium underlain by moderately fine silty-textured alluvium at depths of about 30 inches.  The alluvium is derived form acid and basic igneous rocks; granite, schist, rhyolite, andesite, quartzite, limestone and basalt.  Elevations are 1100 to 2200 feet.  The climate is hot, arid continental.  Average annual precipitation is 4 to 10 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 67 to 75 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 240 to 350 days."

NASIS data and the publication record that rare flooding conditions exist.\nCambic horizon - The zone from about 2 to 28 inches.\nOrganic matter - More than 1 percent throughout.  Horizons not considered part of mollic epipedon because they do not meet the moisture requirements.\nContrasting textures - The difference in clay between upper and lower stories meets the minimum required - 25 percent.\nThe Keys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003 removed the strongly contrasting particle-size class Clayey over fine-silty. The classification was changed to Clayey over loamy in 2006.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003"
