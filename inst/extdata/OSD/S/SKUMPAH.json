  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Skumpah soils are on alluvial flats, lake plains, lake terraces and alluvial fans. They formed in alluvium derived from shale, limestone, siltstone, sandstone, and some igneous rocks. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Elevations range from 1,372 to 1,840 m. The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, intermittently dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 12 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 190 days."

The principal native vegetation is shadscale, black greasewood, yellowbrush, halogeton, lichens, and mosses. These soils are correlated to alkali flat, alkali bottom and desert ecological sites in Utah."
