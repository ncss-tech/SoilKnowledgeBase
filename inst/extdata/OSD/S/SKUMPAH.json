  "OVERVIEW": "The Skumpah series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale, siltstone, limestone, and sandstone. Skumpah soils are on alluvial flats, lake plains, lake terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.",
