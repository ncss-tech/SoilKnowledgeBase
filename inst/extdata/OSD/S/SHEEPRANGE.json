  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Sheeprange soils are on upper back slopes of mountains. Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent. These soils formed in residuum and/or colluvium derived from limestone. Elevations are 1,590 to 3,020 meters (5,220 to 9,910 feet). The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, intermittently moist summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to Great Basin. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 560 millimeters; mean annual air temperature is 2 to 8 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 50 to 110 days."
