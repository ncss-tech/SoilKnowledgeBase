  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 6 feet.  Content of rock fragments in individual horizons of the particle-size control section ranges from 20 to 75 percent but the weighted average is more than 35 percent.  These commonly consist of rounded or angular quartzite and sandstone gravel and cobbles.  The soil is extremely acid through moderately acid in the A horizon, unless limed, and is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the B and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The A horizon is sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.  The B horizon has faint and distinct clay bridging between sand and grains and coatings on individual sand grains in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  The C horizon is loamy sand or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Wallen Series is the only other known series in the same family.  Wallen soils have bedrock at depths ranging from 20 to 40 inches.  Series in other closely related families are the Chenango, Dekalb, Hazelton, Riverhead, and Tunkhannock.  All of these soils have mixed mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sherando soils are nearly level to very steep soils on alluvial and colluvial fans, benches, and sideslopes.  Slopes are mostly between 2 and 15 percent with an extreme range of 0 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in stratified water sorted materials usually washed from soils underlain by quartzite, shale, and sandstone.  Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches near the type location."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Drall and Hazleton soils on the higher uplands and the Laidig soils on the lower sideslopes and benches.  Drall soils have a very channery loamy sand control section.  Hazleton soils lack stratified water sorted material and have mixed mineralogy.  Laidig soils have a fragipan."

The CEC activity class placement is based on similar soils. Class placement may be revised in the future when additional laboratory data becomes available.\nCompeting series, pedon descriptions (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nPrevious revision date: 3/85\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Mechanical analysis (U.S. Forest Service,hydrometer method, Profile No. 162) and chemical analysis (V.P.I. Soil Testing Laboratory) available for samples of horizons of typifying pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
