The moisture control section is moist in some part from December until May and is dry in all parts from July until October.  The soils are either stratified or they have buried A horizons. They have 1 to 4 percent organic matter to a depth of 27 or more inches and the organic matter decreases irregularly with increasing deptb. Rock fragments, mostly gravel, make up O to 35 percent of the soil by volume.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown, dark grayish brown or dark gray (2.5Y 5/2, 4/2; lOYR 5/2, 5/1, 4/2, 4/1, 3/1) dry and very dark grayish brown or very dark gray (2.5Y 3/2; lOYR 3/1, 3/2) moist. It is clay loam, sandy clay loam, gravelly sandy clay loam or gravelly clay loam. This horizon is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon is brown or grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2; 10YR 6/2, 5/2, 5/3) dry and very dark grayish brown, very dark gray or dark brown (10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3; 2.5Y 3/2) moist. Some pedons have mottles below 30 inches that are brown, dark brown, or yellowish brown (10YR 5/3, 4/3) dry. The 10- to 40-inch control section is clay loam, loam, or gravelly loam or gravelly clay loam. This horizon is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe IIAb horizon is gray, dark gray, grayish brown or brown (10YR 5/1, 4/1, 5/2, 4/2, 5/3; 2.5Y 5/2). It is clay loam or loam. Some pedons have disseminated lime.  In some pedons it is gravelly sandy loam below a depth of 40 inches."

Linne and San Benito soils are less than 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact and have horizons with segregated lime. Marimel soils are somewhat poorly drained and have mottles in the lower part of the profile. Mocho soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick and are calcareous throughout. Salinas soils have horizons with segregated lime and the Organic matter decreases regularly with incresing deptb. Sorrento soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick and the organic matter decreases regularly with increasing depth. Vina soils are both hard and massive below depths of 10 to 18 inches."
