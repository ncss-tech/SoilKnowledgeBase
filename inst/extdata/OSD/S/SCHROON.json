  "STATES": "CT,NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Schroon series are very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy till on uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high. Mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 18 to 36 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 3 to 35 percent throughout the soil, including up to 15 percent larger than 3 inches in diameter. They are mainly granite with a lesser amounts of sandstone or other sedimentary rocks. Rock fragments include schist and gneiss in some places. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid in the surface layer, very strongly acid through moderately acid in the subsoil, and strongly acid through slightly acid in the C horizon with slightly acid restricted to depths greater than 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Plowed areas have an Ap horizon 6 to 10 inches thick with moist value and chroma 1 or 2 units higher, and dry value of 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe upper part of the B horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. The lower part of the B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6, and has redoximorphic features. Iron depletions are present within a depth of 24 inches. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam. Structure is fine through coarse granular, subangular blocky, or platy. Consistence is very friable or friable. Some pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam. Thin lenses of silt loam, loamy sand, or sand may occur in some pedons. The horizon is massive or has weak plate-like divisions. Consistence is friable, but some pedons have subhorizons below 30 inches with firm consistence."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Schroon soils are on till uplands. They are usually on footslopes, toeslopes or in slight depressions. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent, but are dominantly 0 to 8 percent. The till parent material is derived largely from granite, and to a lesser extent sandstone or other sedimentary rocks. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 52 inches; mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F.; and the frost-free period ranges from 90 to 140 days. The elevation ranges from 400 to 1000 feet above sea level."

Charlton, Paxton and Stowe are also associates. Charlton and Paxton soils are well drained and occur along the frigid-mesic boundary. Stowe soils are on similar landscapes but have a dense, slowly permeable substratum."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The classification was changed from the Typic subgroup because the majority of the pedons described fit the aquic subgroup.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are as follows:\n(1) Ochric Epipedon - the zone from 0 to 4 inches (A horizon).\n(2) Cambic horizon - the zone from 4 to 22 inches (Bw horizons).\n(3) Dystrudepts Great Group - as evidenced by low pH's and base saturation less than 60 percent in the zone from 10 to 30 inches.\n(4) Aquic subgroup- have redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less and aquic conditions within 24 inches of the surface (Bw2 horizon 13 to 22 inches).\nSoil Interpretation Records: NY0314, NY0315\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
