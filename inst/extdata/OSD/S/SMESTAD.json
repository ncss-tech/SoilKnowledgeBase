Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 1 percent throughout except for the Bt horizon which ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Aquic conditions occur within 16 inches of the soil surface in horizons that also have redox features. Otherwise, aquic conditions occur within 30 inches of the soil surface in one or more horizons with a total thickness of 6 inches or more with moist value of 4 or more and redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less, or with hue of 10YR or redder and chroma of 2 or less.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Some pedons have an A horizon 1 to 4 inches thick, with hue of7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid. Texture is loamy fine sand.\nThe Bw horizons have hue of 7.5 YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Some pedons have subhorizons with loamy fine sand textures.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 3Btg horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  The weighted average clay content is 50 to 80 percent.
