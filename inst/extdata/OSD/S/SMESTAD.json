  "OVERVIEW": "The Smestad series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in sandy lacustrine deposits, loamy lacustrine deposits, and in clayey lacustrine deposits on lake plains.  Permeability is rapid in the sandy mantle, moderate in the loamy layer, and extremely slow or very slow in the clayey deposits.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
