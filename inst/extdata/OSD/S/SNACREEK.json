  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Snacreek soils are on mountains. They typically occur on footslope or backslope positions. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rocks. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 2,170 to 3,200 m. The climate is humid with cold wet winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 600 to 950 mm, the mean annual temperature is 1.5 to 4 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 50 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The revision of January 2004 updates the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Xeric Eutrocryepts. This revision is based on lab data for base saturation indicating base saturation high enough in deeper horizon for the series to be a Mollisol.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 46 cm (A1, A2, and A3 horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 122 and 150 cm at certain times during normal years (part of the C2 horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (lower part of the A3, C1 horizon and upper part of the part C2 horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: The typical pedon at the series type location is reference sampled for the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S91NV-033-002 (pedon # 92P0144). A nearby taxadjunct is also reference sampled as soil survey sample number S91NV-033-006 (pedon # 92P0148). Selected data are available.\nPreviuos authors and editors include: EWB-WED-MJD.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
