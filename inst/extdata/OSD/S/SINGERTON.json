  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Singerton series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material high in carbonates and gypsum which weathered from calcareous, gypsiferous shales.  These nearly level tomoderately steep soils are on uplands.  Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 33 centimeters (13 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C. (54 degrees F.) at the type location.",
