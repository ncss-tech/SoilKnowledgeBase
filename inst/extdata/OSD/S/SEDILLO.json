  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Sedillo soils are on gravelly bajadas, fan terraces, fan remnants, stream terraces and piedmont slopes at elevations ranging from 4,800 to 7,500 feet.  Slopes are dominantly 3 to 20 percent and range from 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in gravelly moderately fine to moderately coarse textured calcareous alluvium derived from mixed rocks.   The climate is semiarid continental. The average annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 48 to 57 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 180 days."
