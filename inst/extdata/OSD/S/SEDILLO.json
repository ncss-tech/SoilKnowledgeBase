  "OVERVIEW": "The Sedillo series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in gravelly alluvium.  Sedillo soils are on bajadas, piedmonts, fan terraces, fan remnanats, and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
