  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Skyhawk soils are on risers of dissected fan terraces. They formed in alluvium derived from Tertiary basalt and residuum derived from Cretaceous siltstone. Slopes range from 35 to 50 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,800 to 7,200 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches about half of which falls as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September. The remainder falls as gentle rain or snow between December and mid-April. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Eagleye, Lavellga, and Toadlena soils. Eagleye soils are shallow to shale, lack diagnostic horizons, and occur on backslopes of structural benches. Lavellga soils are very deep, have carbonatic mineralogy, and occur on adjacent treads of fan terraces. Toadlena soils are shallow, contain gypsic horizons, and occur on summits and footslopes of structural benches."
