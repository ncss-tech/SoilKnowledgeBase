  "OVERVIEW": "The Sugarhol series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on mid- and high-level stream terraces. They have formed in old alluvium derived that is from shale, siltstone, sandstone, quartzite and some limestone. Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches at the type location.",

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Frederick, Macedonia, and Monteagle series are in the same family. Frederick soils formed in limestone residuum and are generally redder in the upper Bt horizon. Macedonia soils formed in residuum from cherty limestone and calcareous shale in the Ozark Mountains and have more angular chert fragments. Monteagle soils formed in sandstone residuum and have angular fragments of sandstone and sandier textures in the subsoil. Canmer, Doniphan, and Lucketts soils are in related families.  Canmer soils form in old alluvium with redder hues in the upper Bt and are underlain by limestone. Doniphan soils formed in residuum from cherty limestone and calcareous shale in the Ozark Mountains and have more angular chert fragments.  Lucketts soils form in colluvium from greenstone and quartzite over calcareous conglomerate in the Triassic Basin."

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 11 inches (A, E and BE horizons).\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 11 to 61 inches (Bt horizon).\n3. Palic feature - no significant decrease in translocated clay content within 60 inches of the top of the argillic horizon.\nMLRA = 128"
