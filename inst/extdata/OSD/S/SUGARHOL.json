Rounded pebbles and cobbles of sandstone and quartzite range from 0 to 15 percent in the A, E and BE horizons, and from 0 to 35 percent in the Bt horizons. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 through 4 and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Ap horizon (where present) has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E or EB horizons have hue of 10YR and 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 6.

Texture is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam and clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. Lithochromic mottles in shades of red, reddish brown and light yellowish brown may be present below a depth of 30 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Frederick, Macedonia, and Monteagle series are in the same family. Frederick soils formed in limestone residuum and are generally redder in the upper Bt horizon. Macedonia soils formed in residuum from cherty limestone and calcareous shale in the Ozark Mountains and have more angular chert fragments. Monteagle soils formed in sandstone residuum and have angular fragments of sandstone and sandier textures in the subsoil. Canmer, Doniphan, and Lucketts soils are in related families.  Canmer soils form in old alluvium with redder hues in the upper Bt and are underlain by limestone. Doniphan soils formed in residuum from cherty limestone and calcareous shale in the Ozark Mountains and have more angular chert fragments.  Lucketts soils form in colluvium from greenstone and quartzite over calcareous conglomerate in the Triassic Basin."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sugarhol soils are on mid- and high-level stream terraces. Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent. The soils form in old alluvium derived primarily from materials weathered from shale, siltstone, sandstone, quartzite and some limestone. Mean annual air temperature is 51 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 42 inches."

Soil Characterization Lab and mineralogy data from the NSSL for the TYPE LOCATION pedon (S94VA-017-19) and four supporting pedons (S93VA-017-10, S94VA-017-07, S94VA-017-17 and S94VA-017-20).\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 11 inches (A, E and BE horizons).\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 11 to 61 inches (Bt horizon).\n3. Palic feature - no significant decrease in translocated clay content within 60 inches of the top of the argillic horizon.\nMLRA = 128\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
