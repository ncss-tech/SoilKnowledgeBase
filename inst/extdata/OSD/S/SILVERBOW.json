  "OVERVIEW": "The Silverbow series consists of very shallow and shallow over a indurated duripan, well drained soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from basalt and related rocks. Silverbow soils are on mountain footslopes, alluvial fans, fan piedmonts, ballenas, pediments and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
