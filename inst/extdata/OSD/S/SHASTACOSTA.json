The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 51 to 57 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is greater than 60 inches.  The particle size control section averages 25 to 30 percent clay and has 45 to 75 percent total rock fragments.  Depth to the clayey-skeletal 2Bt horizon ranges from 35 to 50 inches.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam with 15 to 20 percent clay.  It has 35 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam, very gravelly clay loam, or extremely cobbly clay loam with 25 to 30 percent clay.  It has 40 to 50 percent gravel and 5 to 25 percent cobbles.  Soil reaction is strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has color similar to the Bt horizon.  It is very cobbly clay, very gravelly clay, or extremely gravelly clay averaging 45 to 55 percent clay with 30 to 50 percent gravel and 10 to 20 percent cobbles.  Soil reaction is very strongly acid to strongly acid."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from mudstone and metasedimentary rock types derived from Tertiary sediments of the Flournoy, Lookingglass, and Roseburg Formations.  Elevations are 200 to 2,300 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 80 to 100 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 49 to 56 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 170 to 200 days."
