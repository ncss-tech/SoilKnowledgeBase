  "OVERVIEW": "The Shastacosta series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from mudstone and metasedimentary rock types.  Shastacosta soils are on broad ridgetops and south-facing side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 90 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
