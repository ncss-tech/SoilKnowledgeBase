  "OVERVIEW": "The Slideland series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium from mixed rocks.  Slideland soils are on landslide deposits and terraces in canyons in Cascade foothills.  Slopes range from 3 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches, (1016 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees F, (14 degrees C).",
