Ankona and Nettles soils are on similar to lower positions and have Bh horizons more than 30 inches below the surface.  Basinger, Chobee, Immokalee, Myakka, Pineda and Wabasso soils are on similar to lower positions and lack ortstein.  In addition, Chobee soils are Mollisols and have fine-loamy control sections.  Myakka soils lack Bt horizons below the Bh horizons, and Pineda soils lack spodic horizons.  Wabasso soils are Alfic.  Lawnwood soils do not have argillic horizons below the Bh horizon.  The moderately well drained Pendarvis soils are on higher positions and do not have argillic horizons below the Bh horizon. Pepper soils are Alfic.  The somewhat poorly drained Pomello soils are on higher positions, have Bh horizons below 30 inches and lack ortstein.  The excessively drained St. Lucie soils are on adjacent higher positions, lack spodic horizons and ortstein.  Wauchula soils are on similar positions but lack ortstein.  Winder soils are on similar positions, lack spodic horizons and ortstein, and have fine-loamy control sections."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: A water table is within depths of 10 inches for 1 to 4 months and within a depth of 40 inches for about 6 months in most years.  It is perched above the spodic horizon early in the summer rainy season and after heavy rainfall in other seasons.  During prolonged dry seasons, the water table recedes to below a depth of 40 inches.\nSusanna soils were formerly classified as Groundwater Podzols.  They have been included in the Wauchula series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nDepth to Bh horizon is less than 30 inches from the surface.\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (A horizon).\nSpodic horizon - the zone from 25 to 29 inches (Bh horizon).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 29 to 48 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nOrtstein feature - the zone from 25 to 29 inches (Bh horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
