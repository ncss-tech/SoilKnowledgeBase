  "OVERVIEW": "The Seis series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum from limestone. They are on mountain back slopes and canyon sides. Slopes range from 12 to 35 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches.",
