  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The type location has been moved to Screven County, Georgia. Previous type location in Bulloch County, Georgia was destroyed by excavation for a borrow pit (09/2004). Stilson soils classify by the 10th Edition of the \"Keys to Soil Taxonomy\" as Oxyaquic Paleudults. A proposal is being drafted to reorder the Oxyaquic subgroup to a position in the Key after Arenic Plinthic (similar to the Kandiudults great group). (10/2007).  The change in Taxonomy did not occur.  The classification was changed back to Oxyaquic Paleudults (04/11) DTA.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nArenic feature--the sandy zone from the surface of the soil to 26 inches (A and E horizons).\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 26 to 80 inches (Bt, Btv1, Btv2, B't, and BC horizons).\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to 26 inches (A and E horizons).\nOxyaquic feature--the zone from 35 to 80 inches in normal years is saturated for 20 consecutive or 30 cumulative days (Btv, Bt, and BC horizons).\nPlinthic features--the zone with 5 percent or more plinthite from 35 to 61 inches (Btv1 and Btv2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: None\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
