    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F.from early April to late November and exceeds 47 degrees F. from early May to mid November.  The soil between a depth of 12 and 30 inches is dry from mid July to mid October 90 to 110 days, and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  The depth to sand or gravelly sand ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Gravel make up 0 to 35 percent of the upper soil.  Strata below 30 inches may be as high as 80 percent gravel.  The volcanic ash is composed of 1 to 10 percent glass shards and 50 to 70 percent weathered and unweathered glass aggregates.  The lower part of the substratum may have 1 to 4 inch thick layers of silt size glacial rock flour.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3 or 5/4.  Moist colors are N 2/0; 10YR 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 2/0, 2/1, 2/2, 2/3, 3/1, 3/2 or 3/3.  It is loamy sand or loamy fine sand and may be gravelly.  Structure is very fine granular, single grain or massive.  It is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe C horizon color is 10YR or 2.5YR 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/1, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/1, 7/2, 7/3 or 7/4.  Moist color is 10YR or 2.5Y 2/1, 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, 4/1, 4/2 or 4/3.  The C horizons are stratified.  They are loamy sand or sand and may be gravelly, very gravelly or extremely gravelly.

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Shasta soils occupy nearly level to moderately sloping glacial outwash plains and fans and have developed in glacial outwash from glacial rock flour and volcanic ash.  They occur at elevations of 3000 to 5000 feet in a dry mesothermal climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 35 to 60 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 47 to 50 degrees F. The average January temperature is about 31 degrees F.  The average July temperature is about 66 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."
