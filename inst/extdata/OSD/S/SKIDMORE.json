  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches and depth to bedrock from 40 to more than 100 inches. The content of siltstone and sandstone fragments, commonly a mixture of gravels and cobbles or channers and flagstones, ranges from 0 to 50 percent in the upper solum and from 35 to 90 percent in the lower solum and substratum. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Some pedons have slightly lower values in the upper 1 to 4 inches. Fine-earth texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or less commonly, silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Some pedons are variegated without dominant hue or chroma. Fine-earth texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam or clay loam.\nThe BC and C horizons have colors and fine-earth textures similar to the Bw horizon. Some pedons have 1 to 2 inch thick strata of loamy sand or are dominantly loamy sand below 30 inches. Some pedons have iron depletions or depleted layers with chroma of 1 or 2 below 40 inches. A lithologic discontinuity is common, but not required.\nThe R horizon is unweathered siltstone, shale or limestone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on flood plains with slopes of 0 to 4 percent and formed in alluvium weathered primarily from Mississippian aged sandstone, siltstone and limestone. They are subject to occasional or frequent flooding. Near the type location, average annual temperature is 55 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 51.2 inches."

Clifty, Orrville, Renox and Shelocta soils are fine-loamy. Grigsby, Helechawa, Rigley and Pope soils are coarse-loamy. Lindside, Nolin, Morehead and Westbend soils are fine-silty. Bledsoe and Cruze soils are fine. Bledsoe, Carpenter, Cruze, Morehead, Renox, Rigley, Shelocta and Westbend soils have argillic horizons."
