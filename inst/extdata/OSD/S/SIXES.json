The soils are usually moist but are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 25 percent clay and has 15 to 30 percent total rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 20 to 40 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick and may include all or part of the Bw horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is channery silt loam with 15 to 25 percent clay.  It has 15 to 30 percent channers.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is channery silt loam or channery loam with 18 to 25 percent clay.  It has 15 to 30 percent channers and 0 to 3 percent flagstones."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from schist or phyllite rock types of the Colebrooke Schist Formation.  Elevations are 1,000 to 3,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 130 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.   The frost-free period is 160 to 210 days."

All of these soils occur on broad ridgetops or side slopes of mountains.  Edson soils have argillic horizons.  Deadline soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock and are loamy-skeletal. Goldbeach soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to bedrock.  Irma soils are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock and have an ochric epipedon. Nailkeg soils are loamy-skeletal.  Goldbeach soils occur in open grassland areas on ridgetops and south-facing side slopes of mountains."
