  "OVERVIEW": "The Sixes series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from schist or phyllite rock types.  Sixes soils occur in open grassland areas on ridgetops and south-facing side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist but are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 25 percent clay and has 15 to 30 percent total rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 20 to 40 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick and may include all or part of the Bw horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is channery silt loam with 15 to 25 percent clay.  It has 15 to 30 percent channers.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.
