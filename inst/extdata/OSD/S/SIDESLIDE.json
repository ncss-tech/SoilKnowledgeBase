  "OVERVIEW": "The Sideslide series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from Mancos shale.  Sideslide soils are in drainageways, and on hillslopes and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 1 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C.",
