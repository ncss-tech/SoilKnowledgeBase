  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to sand, gravel, and cobbles is 25 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 62 to 68 degrees F.  These soils are usually calcareous throughout.  Some pedons are leached a few inches.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils are slightly to strongly alkaline.  The upper part of the control section (Cg horizon) is highly stratified and averages sandy loam.  It has 6 to 18 percent clay, 10 to 40 percent silt, 50 to 80 percent fine sand or coarser and 0 to 35 percent rock fragments, mainly gravel and cobbles.  The sand and silt fractions contain 5 to 20 percent or more of dark colored ferromagnesian rich minerals and basalt fragments.  Hue is 5Y through 10YR, value is 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma is 1 or 2."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shoshone soils are on floodplains and low terraces at elevations of 3,800 to 5,200 feet.  Slope gradients typically range from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in highly stratified but predominantly moderately coarse textured sediments derived from basaltic material.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 7 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months. Mean annual temperature is 45 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 69 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 140 days."
