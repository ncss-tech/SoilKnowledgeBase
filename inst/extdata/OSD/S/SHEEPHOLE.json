  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bristolake (CA) and Goldrose (CA) series. Both soils formed dominantly in alluvium. Bristolake soils are at least slightly effervescent and moderately alkaline in the surface horizon and have an electrical conductivity (EC) of 4 to 16 dS/m and an SAR of 5 to 12 somewhere throughout most of the particle-size control section. Goldrose soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 25 to 28 degrees C. and are dry throughout the soil profile for most of the year. Both soils have coarser than fine sands throughout the profile."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sheephole soils are on thin sand sheets overlying fan remnants, fan aprons, and alluvial fans. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. These soils formed in eolian material over alluvium from granitoid or other igneous rocks. Elevations range from 260 to 670 meters (850 to 2,200 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."

Dalelake soils are on identical landforms as well as adjacent dunes but do not have an alluvial layer or more than 7 percent rock fragments anywhere within the particle-size control section. Pintobasin and Carrizo soils are formed in alluvium and are found on fan aprons and channels of drainageways, respectively. Pintobasin and Carrizo soils have sandy and sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections, respectively. In addition, Pintobasin soils do not have a layer within the particle-size control section that averages more than 35 percent rock fragments."
