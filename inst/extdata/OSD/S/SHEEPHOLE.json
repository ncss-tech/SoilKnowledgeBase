  "OVERVIEW": "The Sheephole series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian material over alluvium from granitoid or other igneous rocks. Sheephole soils are on thin sand sheets overlying fan remnants, fan aprons, and alluvial fans. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).",

Bristolake soils are at least slightly effervescent and moderately alkaline in the surface horizon and have an electrical conductivity (EC) of 4 to 16 dS/m and an SAR of 5 to 12 somewhere throughout most of the particle-size control section. Goldrose soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 25 to 28 degrees C. and are dry throughout the soil profile for most of the year.

Pintobasin and Carrizo soils have sandy and sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections, respectively. In addition, Pintobasin soils do not have a layer within the particle-size control section that averages more than 35 percent rock fragments."
