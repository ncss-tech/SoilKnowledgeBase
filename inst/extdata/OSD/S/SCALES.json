  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The interface between the A and C horizon has a thin layer of clean gravel in many pedons.  The O horizon, and A and B horizons, when present, have 0 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobblestones, and 0 to 25 percent stones by volume.  The C horizon has 5 to 35 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent stones and 0 to 5 percent cobblestones.  The soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe O horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fibric, hemic, or sapric material.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2 or is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  It is loamy sandy, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Mucky analogues are common.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 through 8.  If sufficient fine-earth is present, texture is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Cg horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Fine-earth texture is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 through 8.  Fine-earth texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Scales soils are on nearly level and gently sloping landscapes in drainageways, but may also be in upland depressions and on benches.  Slopes are typically 0 to 2 percent but range from 0 to 7 percent where wetness is due to seepage.  The soils formed in loamy colluvium and the organic horizons developed above. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 60 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 40 (4.5 degrees C) to 46 (8 degrees C) degrees F."

Balsam and Bearpen soils average more that 35 percent rock fragments.  Balsam soils are in cove positions.  Snowsnake soils are moderately well drained.  Mt Rogers soils are well drained.  Nopan soils do not have a histic epipedon."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Scales series was proposed in the Mt. Rogers National Recreation Area for a special project. It appears on the legend for that area. It was also used on the legend for the Grayson County Soil Survey Area.\nThe 6/2006 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). The CEC activity class placement is based on similar soils and not on laboratory data. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available. Reaction class was also assigned. Mineralogy class is assumed. The 7/2013 revision updates the series status and Series Established section.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Histic epipedon-the zone from 0 to 11 inches (O horizons).\nb. Aquic conditions in a layer between 16 and 20 inches from the mineral soil surface or in a layer above a densic contact (Cg horizon).\nc. Densic contact (21 inches-top of the Cd1 horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: There are no known data available. Transect data are available from the Grayson County SS Area.\nMLRA=130\nRevised: 6/9/95-MHC; 8/2000-DHK; 6/2006-DHK ; 7/2013-JRT\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
