  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Shonkin soils are usually moist.  Mean annual soil temperature is 47 degrees to 50 degrees F.  Solum thickness is 32 to 60 inches.  Accumulations of carbontes are faint to prominent in the  Bw and Bk horizons, and in some pedons gypsum crystals in nests of seams occur in or below the Bk horizon.  In some deeply tilled areas, some pedons have clay loam Ap horizons.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or silt loam with weak granular to weak vesicular platy structure.\nThe B&E horizon has lamellae of silt loam or bleached sand and silt 1 to 10 mm thick, and in pedons having columnar Bt horizons tongue into that horizon 5 to 30 mm.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay or clay with 40 to 60 percent clay.  It has moderate medium prismatic to strong medium columnar structure that separates to weak thin plates in the upper few inches and to moderate to strong blocks in the lower part.  Sodium saturation ranges from 5 to 10 percent in the B horizons, and increases with depth into the C horizon."

The soils formed in clay loam, silty clay or clay alluvium.  The climate is cool semiarid with mean annual air temperature of 45 degrees to 48 degrees F., mean summer temperature of 65 degrees to 70 degrees F., and frost-free period of 95 to 150 days."

In addition, Arvada and Winnett soils have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium in a major part of the Bt horizon and Gilt Edge soils have E horizons 5 inches or less in thickness resting abruptly on strong columnar Bt horizons."
