  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Shonkin soils are usually moist.  Mean annual soil temperature is 47 degrees to 50 degrees F.  Solum thickness is 32 to 60 inches.  Accumulations of carbontes are faint to prominent in the  Bw and Bk horizons, and in some pedons gypsum crystals in nests of seams occur in or below the Bk horizon.  In some deeply tilled areas, some pedons have clay loam Ap horizons.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or silt loam with weak granular to weak vesicular platy structure.\nThe B&E horizon has lamellae of silt loam or bleached sand and silt 1 to 10 mm thick, and in pedons having columnar Bt horizons tongue into that horizon 5 to 30 mm.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay or clay with 40 to 60 percent clay.  It has moderate medium prismatic to strong medium columnar structure that separates to weak thin plates in the upper few inches and to moderate to strong blocks in the lower part.  Sodium saturation ranges from 5 to 10 percent in the B horizons, and increases with depth into the C horizon."
