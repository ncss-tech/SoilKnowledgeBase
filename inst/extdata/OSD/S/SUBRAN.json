  "OVERVIEW": "The Subran series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in medium and fine textured marine sediments on uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Average annual temperature is about 63 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is about 53 inches near the type location.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  Reaction of the A and Bt horizons ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.  Reaction of the Btc and B't horizon ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.  Content of black nodules and stains (assumed to be MnO2) is few in the A, Bt, and B't horizons and ranges from common to many in the Btc horizons.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is typically fine sandy loam or sandy loam but includes loam and clay loam in eroded areas.\nSome pedons have a thin E or BE horizon with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is typically clay loam, but ranges to clay.  Mottles with chroma 2 or less are within 30 inches of the surface.  The lower part has the same range in color as the upper part of the Bt horizon or it has no dominant matrix color and is mottled in shades of yellow, brown, gray, and red.  Texture is clay loam, clay, or silty clay."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

None of the competing series have significant accumulations of dark nodules and stains in the argillic horizon.  Additionally, the Angie soils have gray Btg horizons in the lower part of the solum and the Chrysler and Tiak soils have dominant hue redder than 7.5YR in the upper part of the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in medium and fine textured marine sediments.  The climate is warm and humid.  Average annual temperature ranges from 60 to 65 degrees F. and average annual precipitation ranges from 48 to 58 inches."

Bama soils are on slightly higher positions and are fine-loamy.  Brantley soils are on narrow ridges and steeper side slopes and have a decrease in clay content within 60 inches of the surface.  The Eutaw, Kipling, Oktibbeha, and Vaiden soils are on slightly lower positions and have vertic properties.  Smithdale soils are on lower side slopes and are fine-loamy."
