    "content": "REMARKS:  There is question if this soil contains sufficient amounts of concretions and/or nodules to classify in the Petronodic subgroup.  Fragments of calcium carbonate described in the Bk1 horizon may be interpreted as concretions.  The origin of these fragments needs further study before classification to the Petronodic subgroup is made.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 20 cm.  (A horizons)\nCalcic horizon: 20 to 66cm.  (Bk horizon)\nParalithic contact: soft shale at 66 cm Cr horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL data from Guadalupe County, NM (S85NM-019-001).\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
