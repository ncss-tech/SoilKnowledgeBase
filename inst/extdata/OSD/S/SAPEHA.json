  "OVERVIEW": "The Sapeha series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from mixed igneous sources.  Sapeha soils are on moderately steep to steep mesa hillslopes.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
