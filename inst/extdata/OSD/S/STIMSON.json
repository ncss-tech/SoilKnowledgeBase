The soil ranges from medium acid in the surface to very strongly acid in the control section.  The particle size control section is silty clay loam or silt loam, 20 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand.  The umbric epipedon is 7 to 9 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 1, 2 or 3 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist, 2 or 3 dry and is mottled in some pedons.  Value of 6 dry is only in the lower part of the horizon.  This horizon has weak very coarse to very fine subangular blocky structure.\nThe B horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 (2 or 3 rubbed) moist or dry and is mottled.  This horizon has weak angular blocky structure or is massive.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and 1 or 2 dry.  The mottles have hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 6 through 8 moist or dry.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam."
