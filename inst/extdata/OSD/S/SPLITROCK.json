    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to loam or clay loam till ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The depth to carbonates ranges from 18 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 20 inches and extends into the Bw horizon in most pedons.  A stone line or a loamy fine sand layer 1 to 3 inches thick is at the contact of the till in some pedons.  The particle size control section is silty clay loam or silt loam averaging between 25 to 35 percent clay and less than 3 percent fine sand and coarser in the loess above the till contact.\nThe A horizon has a 10YR hue, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is silty clay loam but is silt loam in some pedons.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam.  Some pedons have a thin layer of fine sand to fine sandy loam in the lower portion of the Bw horizon.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam or loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  There are few to many soft masses of carbonate.  Some pedons have a silty clay loam or silt loam Bk horizon.\nThe 2BC horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam or loam.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Distinct or prominent redox features are few to many in most 2C horizons.  Moist bulk density ranges from 1.60 to 1.85 g/cc.  Structure is in the form of large prisms."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Splitrock soils are nearly level to gently sloping on smooth plane and complex slopes of the uplands.  These soils formed in 20 to 40 inches of loess and the underlying loam or clay loam glacial till.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 26 inches. Growing season is about 135 to 165 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 17 to 20 inches; and growing degree days are about 2700 to 3500."

Alcester and Trent soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick and are on foot slopes below the Splitrock soils. Ihlen soils are in areas where the loess mantle of 20 to 40 inches overlies quartzite bedrock.  Moody and Nora soils are on plane to convex slopes near the Splitrock soils. Flandreau and Grovena soils formed in loamy materials and are on plane to convex slopes near the Splitrock soils. Houdek and Shindler soils formed in glacial till and are on plane to convex slopes near the Splitrock soils.  Whitewood soils are on concave foot slopes below the Splitrock soils."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained.  Surface runoff is low to medium.  Permeability is moderate in the loess and moderately slow or slow in the clay loam or loam glacial till.  Seasonal high saturation occurs at depths of 30 to 40 inches in normal years during the months of April to May and periods of unusually high rainfall. It often occurs as a perched layer in the loess on top of the glacial till during wet periods."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 9 inches.  (Ap horizon); cambic horizon - the zone from about 9 to 34 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\nRecent investigations have shown an extremely coarse prismatic structure to exist as a normal property in the lowest parts of this soil.  The C horizon designation was therefore changed to a BC designation.  The series was changed to an Oxyaquic subgroup based on an evaluation of depth to redox features, field observations and correlation of similar soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
