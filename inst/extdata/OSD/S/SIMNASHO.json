    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days within the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 46 degrees F.  Depth to weathered andesite bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  Hue is 7.5YR or 10YR.  Thickness of the ashy material with andic soil properties is 20 to 30 inches.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 85 percent rock fragments.  The upper part of the control section has a phosphate retention of 30 to 65 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.5 to 1.5 percent, 20 to 40 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregate, and 10 to 15 percent field estimated clay.  The lower part has 5 to 15 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregate, and 25 to 35 percent field estimated clay.  It is slightly to moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  The moist bulk density is 0.80 to 0.90g/cc.  It is very stony sandy loam or very cobbly sandy loam with 0 to 10 percent gravel, 10 to 30 percent cobbles and 5 to 40 percent stones.\nThe AB horizon is similar to the A and has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 5 percent gravel, 20 to 40 percent cobbles and 10 to 20 percent stones.\nThe 2Btb horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very cobbly loam, extremely cobbly loam or extremely cobbly clay loam.  It has 0 to 5 percent gravel, 30 to 50 percent cobbles and 10 to 25 percent stones."

The soil formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from andesite with a mantle of volcanic ash.  The climate is characterized by cold and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 40 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 41 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 100 days."

The upper 24 inches meets andic soil properties and 15 bar water content of less than 12 percent (dried).  This is based on geographically associated soils.  The lower part from 24 to 33 inches does not meet andic properties.  The family placement (ashy-skeletal) is based on a weighted average.\n02/2016 - Removed these coordinates due to improper location.  Do not use.
