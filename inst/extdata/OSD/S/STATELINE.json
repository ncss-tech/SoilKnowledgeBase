    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to about 70 inches and the depth to carbonates is below 60 inches.  The loamy sediment ranges from 16 to 30 inches thick.  This sediment typically lacks coarse fragments, but the lower part in some pedons has a few.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.  The reaction ranges from neutral through medium acid.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from medium acid through very strongly acid.\nThe 2Btg horizons have hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has higher or lower chroma mottles.  The texture typically is clay or silty clay with subhorizons of clay loam or silty clay loam in some pedons.  Coatings of silt or very fine sand are not in all pedons.  The reaction ranges from medium acid through very strongly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stateline soils are in shallow swales and on broad low lying flats of upland till plains.  They formed in 16 to 30 inches of loess or loamy sediments and underlying clayey paleosol.  The paleosol is probably Aftonian Age and formed in pedisediments and till.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 43 to 48 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 28 to 34 inches."

Donnan soils are similar, but are better drained and are on slightly higher landscape positions. Sargeant and Skyberg soils are on slightly higher landscape positions, are better drained and do not have the clayey subsoil.  Brownsdale soils are in similar position, but do not have the clayey subsoil."
