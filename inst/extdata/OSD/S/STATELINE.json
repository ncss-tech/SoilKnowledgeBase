  "OVERVIEW": "The Stateline series consists of deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loess or loamy sediments and underlying clayey paleosol.  These soils are in shallow swales and on broad low lying flats of upland till plains with slopes less than 2 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.",

The loamy sediment ranges from 16 to 30 inches thick.  This sediment typically lacks coarse fragments, but the lower part in some pedons has a few.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.  The reaction ranges from neutral through medium acid.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from medium acid through very strongly acid.\nThe 2Btg horizons have hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has higher or lower chroma mottles.  The texture typically is clay or silty clay with subhorizons of clay loam or silty clay loam in some pedons.  Coatings of silt or very fine sand are not in all pedons.  The reaction ranges from medium acid through very strongly acid."
