Clenage and Maderbak soils have horizons that are strongly effervescent and have secondary carbonates. Havingdon soils have coarse fragments consisting of angular chert in the particle-size control section and are underlain by chert bedrock with visible secondary carbonate masses. Vanwyper soils have less than 40 percent sand in the particle-size control section."
