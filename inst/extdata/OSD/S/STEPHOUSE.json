  "OVERVIEW": "The Stephouse series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum, eolian sands and/or slope alluvium derived from interbedded sandstone, shale and conglomerate.  Stephouse soils are on ridges, mesas and structural benches.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
