These soils formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, and residuum from basalt, basalt cinders, bombs, and ash. Elevation ranges from 2,500 to 5,500 feet (762 to 1676.4 meters). The mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 67 degrees F (13.9 to 19.4 degrees C), and the frost-free season is 180 to 240 days. The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches (305 to 406 mm) and occurs mainly as thundershowers in July and August and rains in December and January."
