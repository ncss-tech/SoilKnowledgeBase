  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F. and the soil temperature is rarely if ever below 47 degrees F.  The soil between depths of about 5 and 15 inches usually is dry all of the time from late April or May until November or early December and usually is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.  The 10 to 40 inch control section is loam, fine sandy loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam or silty clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Few pedons have as much as 15 percent rock fragments.  The upper part of the profile is slightly acid to moderately alkaline, and is noncalcareous to a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Effervescence is weak to violent in disseminated lime and secondary powder or mycelial lime is present.\nThe A horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue.  It has weak to strong granular or subangular blocky structure.  This horizon has 2 to 4 percent organic matter in the upper part which decreases regularly to less than 1 percent at depths of 12 to 20 inches.\nThe B and C horizons are 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/4; 2.5Y 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/4, 7/2 and 5Y 6/3.  It is somewhat stratified, particularly in the lower part of some pedons but contrasting texture is not present above a depth of 40 inches."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Apollo, Domengine, Nacimiento and Thomhill soils that have CEC activity class updated and the Fontana and Woo series in the same family that do not have CEC activity class updated.  Apollo soils have a paralithic contact below 40 inches.  Domengine, Fontana and Nacimiento soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Woo soils do not have a paralithic contact within a depth of 60 inches.  Thomhill soils are moist in some part onl 136 days; they have a Xeric bordering on an aridic moisture regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sorrento soils are on alluvial fans and established floodplains at elevations of 25 to 2,100 feet.  They formed in medium textured alluvium, mostly from sedimentary formations.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The climate is dry subhumid with moderately warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 10 to 20 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 50 degrees F., the average July temperature is about 65 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F.  The freeze-free period is about 200 to 330 days."
