  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10 to 40 inch control section is stratified fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loam with thin\nstrata of sandy clay loam or silt loam.  Clay content of the 10 to\n40 inch control section is 5 to 18 percent and more than 15\npercent is coarser than very fine sand.  Reaction is moderately alkaline and calcareous, however, mildly alkaline strata are\ncommon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or loamy fine sand.\nThe C horizons are in hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 8, chroma of\n3 or 4."

Bosque, Bunyan, Colorado, and Energy soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch\ncontrol section.  Camargo and Clairemont soils have fine-silty control sections.  Lincoln and Zalla soils are loamy fine sand or coarser.  Pulaski, Pulexas, and Zavala soils are noncalcareous.  Yahola soils have stratified layers with hues redder than 7.5YR.  Yomont soils have coarse-silty control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Slopes are mainly 0 to 1 percent, but range from 0\nto 2 percent.  The soil formed in stratified calcareous alluvium.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 62 degrees to 70 degrees F.;\nmean annual precipitation from 25 to 40 inches; and Thornthwaite annual P-E indices from 40 to 64."
