  "OVERVIEW": "The Salix series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on convex rises on flood plains and stream terraces. Salix soils formed in alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 710 millimeters (28 inches).",
