  "OVERVIEW": "The Skyuka series consists of gently sloping to strongly sloping, very deep, well drained soils on stream terraces of the Piedmont.  They formed in old alluvium washed from upland soils underlain dominantly by dark colored high grade metamorphic rocks such as hornblende gneiss, amphibolite, hornblende schist, and biotite gneiss.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 64 inches and mean annual temperature is 59 degrees F. near the type location.",

Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid unless lime has been added.  Limed soils typically range from moderately acid to neutral in the upper part of the solum.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent by volume throughout.  Fragments are gravel or cobbles.  Content of mica flakes ranges from none to common.  Content of iron-manganese masses ranges from few to common in the B and C horizons of some pedons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Textures are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.\nIn some pedons, there is a BA or AB horizon that has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The Bt horizon is clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.  Silt content is less than 30 percent.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Redoximorphic features of high chroma and low chroma in shades of red, yellow, gray or brown are in the BC horizon of some pedons below a depth of 48 inches.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam.\nIn some pedons, there is a BCc horizon that contains many hard iron-manganese concretions ranging from about 1/4 to 2 inches in diameter.  It has the same colors and textures as the BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8, or is multicolored in shades of red, yellow, gray, or brown.  These colors are redoximorphic features of iron depletions and massses of iron accumulation.  Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Thin strata of loamy sand or sandy clay are in some pedons."

Brantley soils formed in marine sediments and are slowly permeable.  Canton Bend are slowly permeable and contain more than 30 percent silt in the Bt horizon.  Capshaw, Cowton, Gundy, Hampshire, Magnet, Spray, and Zion soils are on uplands and may have bedrock at depths ranging from 20 to 60 inches.  Also, Capshaw soils have more silt than Skyuka soils.  Enon and Mecklenburg soils are on uplands, have sola less than 40 inches thick, and are underlain by saprolite.  Maben soils have a 20 to 48 inch solum and formed in marine sediment.  Meth soils have hue as red as 2.5YR, moderately slow permeability, and formed in coastal plain sediments of Tertiary age.  Spray soils formed from shale and contain shale fragments.  Zuber soils have moderately slow permeability and contain limestone fragments."

Cecil and Pacolet soils have red Bt horizons and have C horizons in residuum.  Buncombe soils are sandy throughout and have no diagnostic subsurface horizons.  Hiwassee, Davidson and Lloyd soils have hue of 2.5YR or redder and value of 3 or less in the Bt horizon.  Masada soils have base saturation of less than 35 percent.  Altavista and State soils are in younger, lower positions on stream terraces.  Cecil, Davidson, Gaston, Grover, Lloyd, Madison, Pacolet, Rion are on nearby upland ridges and side slopes.  Buncombe, Chewacla, and Riverview soils are on nearby flood plains.  Hiwassee soils are on older higher stream terraces.  Masada soils are in the same landscape positions as Skyuka soils."
