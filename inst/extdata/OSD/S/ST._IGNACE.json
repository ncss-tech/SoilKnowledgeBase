  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. RWJ-WEF-MLK",
  "REVDATE": "08/2012",
  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The St. Ignace series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in loamy drift underlain by fractured limestone or breccia on glacial lake beaches, lake terraces, and lake benches. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The St. Ignace soils are on nearly level to steep topography on the glacial Lake Algonquin beach and rock terraces, as well as on some higher glacial lake benches that are controlled by bedded limestone. Slope gradients commonly are 2 to 12 percent slope but range from 0 to about 70 percent. These soils are near the present shore line of Lake Michigan and Lake Huron and the climate is modified by these bodies of water. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 787 mm (27 to 31 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.6 to 6.7 degrees C (42 to 44 degrees F)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alpena, Longrie and Ruse soils. The excessively drained Alpena soils contain bedrock at depths greater than 152 cm (60 inches) and are on similar landscape positions with the St. Ignace soils on glacial lake benches and lake beaches. The well drained Longrie soils are contain bedrock at depths from 50 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) and are on similar landscape positions. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Ruse soils are in depressions and in association with the St. Ignace soils."
