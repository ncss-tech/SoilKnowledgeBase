These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 100 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches.  The upper 7 to 20 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.10 to 1.45 b/cc, volcanic glass content of 15 to 25 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half if acid oxalate iron of 0.25 to 0.6 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 45 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 40 to 80 percent rock fragments.  Base saturation is more than 75 percent.  Organic matter is estimated to range from 2 to 4 percent in the Ap or A horizons.  The depth to an extremely or very gravelly moderately cemented iron-silica duripan is 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe Ap or A horizons  have value of 3 through 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry and 1 or 2 moist.\nThe BA horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is gravelly loam or very gravelly loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly clay, extremely gravelly sandy clay or very gravelly clay loam.\nThe 3Bstqm horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry and 2 through 4 moist.  It is very gravelly sandy clay loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam or extremely gravelly sandy clay loam.\nThe 3Bsqm horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry and 2 through 4 moist.  It is very gravelly sandy clay loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam or extremely gravelly sandy clay loam.\nThe 3Bs horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6 dry and 2 through 4 moist.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sketter soils are on old uplifted fan remnants, old terraces and old till plains and have slopes of 2 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium and glacial drift over a duripan with an influence of loess mixed with volcanic ash in the surface.  Elevation is 1,700 to 3,100 feet.  Climate is semiarid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches.  The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 69 degrees F., and average annual temperature is about 46 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 130 to 150 days."

Maxhill soils (on terraces and alluvial fans), Metser soils (on terraces and alluvial fans) and Millhouse soils (on alluvial fans) all lack a duripan.
