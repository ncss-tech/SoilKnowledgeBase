  "OVERVIEW": "The Sketter series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium and glacial drift over a duripan with an influence of loess mixed with volcanic ash in the surface.  They are on old uplifted fan remnants, old terraces and old till plains.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
