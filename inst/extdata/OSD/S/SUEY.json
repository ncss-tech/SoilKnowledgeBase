    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil between the depths of 6 and 19 inches is usually moist from the beginning of November to the middle of May and usually dry the rest of the year. Mean annual soil temperature is about 62 degrees to 64 degrees F. Organic matter is more than one percent at a depth of 22 to 30 inches. Base saturation is more than 75 percent in all parts. Clay content ranges from 17 to 25 percent but averages 18 to 20 percent in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Textures are heavy very fine sandy loam or silt loam throughout and are less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.\nThe A horizon is dark grayish brown, dark brown, grayish brown, or brown (10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 5/2). It is slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons have a cambic (B) horizon with colors of brown, reddish brown, or yellowish red (7.5YR 5/4; 5YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6), or mixed brown and pale brown (7.5YR 5/4 and 10YR 4/3), or mixed brown and pink (7.5YR 5/4 and 7.5YR 7/4). It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon is yellowish brown, brown, pinkish gray, reddish brown, light reddish brown, or reddish yellow (10YR 5/4; 7.5YR 5/4, 6/2; 5YR 5/4, 6/4, 6/6). It is neutral to moderately alkaline and is noncalcareous."

The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm, dry but foggy summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 13 to 18 inches. Average January temperature is about 51 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 63 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 58 degrees to 59 degrees F. The frost-free season is 330 to 365 days."
