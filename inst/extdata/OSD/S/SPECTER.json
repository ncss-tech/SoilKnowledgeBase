They have developed in very gravelly loamy alluvium derived primarily from tuffs.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. They are at elevations between 1,520 and 1,740 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm. The mean annual temperature about 11 to 14 degrees C and the frost-free period ranges between 130 to 150 days."
