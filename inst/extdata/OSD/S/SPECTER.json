  "OVERVIEW": "The Specter consists of moderately deep to an indurated duripan, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from tuffs. Specter soils are on fan piedmonts. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",

The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm. The mean annual temperature about 11 to 14 degrees C and the frost-free period ranges between 130 to 150 days."
