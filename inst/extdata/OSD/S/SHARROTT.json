  "OVERVIEW": "The Sharrott series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material derived from argillite or quartzite bedrock.  These soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 4 to 85 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
