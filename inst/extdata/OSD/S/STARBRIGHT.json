The upper portions of the fractured Cr material, commonly has distinct clay films on rock fragments and in some profiles would be described as fragmental. This should be considered when evaluating such properties as AWC.\nMollic Horizons range from 24 to 32 cm thick.\nArgillic Horizons range from 40 to 90 cm thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Starbright soils are found on predominately north aspects and in the lower portions of landforms and drainageways under continuous stands of oak and island chaparral. They formed in residuum from andesite, rhyolite and basaltic rock on complex side slopes of interfluves of hills and mountains on islands. Slopes range from 10 to 65 percent. Elevations are from sea level to 1675 feet (0 to 511 meters). The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters with potential fog common all year. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 7 to 17 inches (178 to 432 mm), the mean annual temperature is 59 to 66 degrees F. (15 to 19 degrees C.), and the frost free season is 355 to 365 days."

Freeboard and Luff soils are on linear and concave shapes of the upper and middle sideslopes under grass and sage communities. Purser soils are steep side slopes and are less than 50 cm to lithic rock. Tongva is fine-loamy, dominantly on convex and linear portions of sideslopes under sage communities."

The iso classification dictates the moisture regime to not be xeric. These soils are possibly in the Aridic subgroup. Moisture control section data is needed for this classification.\nMollic Horizon--The zone from the mineral surface to a depth of 30 cm\nArgillic Horizon--The zone of clay accumulation between 20 cm and 85 cm or bedrock.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
