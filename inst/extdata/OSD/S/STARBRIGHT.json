  "OVERVIEW": "The Starbright series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in residuum from andesite, rhyolite and basaltic rock. Starbright soils are generally on northern side slopes and in lower positions of interfluves on hills and mountains. Slopes range from 10 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 305 millimeters (12 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C (64 degrees F).",

The upper portions of the fractured Cr material, commonly has distinct clay films on rock fragments and in some profiles would be described as fragmental. This should be considered when evaluating such properties as AWC.\nMollic Horizons range from 24 to 32 cm thick.\nArgillic Horizons range from 40 to 90 cm thick."

They formed in residuum from andesite, rhyolite and basaltic rock on complex side slopes of interfluves of hills and mountains on islands. Slopes range from 10 to 65 percent. Elevations are from sea level to 1675 feet (0 to 511 meters). The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters with potential fog common all year. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 7 to 17 inches (178 to 432 mm), the mean annual temperature is 59 to 66 degrees F. (15 to 19 degrees C.), and the frost free season is 355 to 365 days."
