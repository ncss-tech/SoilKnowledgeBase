  "OVERVIEW": "The Staples series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in sandy glacial outwash and underlying a dense sandy loam till.  It is deep to a densic contact.  These soils are on glacial drumlins and ground moraines.  They have rapid permeability in the upper part and very slow permeability in the dense underlying till.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The sandy mantle ranges from 20 to 40 inches thick.  The depth to dense till (densic contact) ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to free carbonates is 40 to 72 inches or more.  These soils typically have 0 to 15 percent rock fragments in the upper part and 2 to 15 percent rock fragments in the glacial till.   Content of rock fragments are higher in thin stone lines at or near the contact of the glacial till.  Rock fragments are of mixed lithology and pebble to cobblestone in size.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sand.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 2.  Most pedons have redoximorphic features.  The E horizon is loamy sand, sand, loamy fine sand,  fine sand and their gravelly or cobbly analogues just above the 2B horizon.  The reaction is strongly acid to neutral.  Some pedons have EB or BE horizons.\nThe 2Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam.  The particle size control section averages 8 to 35 percent clay and 65 to 75 percent sand.  It has few to many faint or distinct clay films on the faces of peds.  It is strongly acid to neutral.  Some pedons have 2BC horizons.\nThe 2Cd horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It typically is sandy loam but includes loamy sand in some pedons.  The moist bulk density ranges from 1.8 to 2.0 gm/cc.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline. Some pedons have pockets or wedges of sandy or gravelly material in the 2B and 2Cd horizons.  This horizon is considered as a densic contact."

They are formed in a sandy outwash and underlying dense glacial till.  Slopes ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 33 inches.  Frost-free days are about 90 to 172 days. The elevation is about 670 to 1600 feet above sea level."

Blowers and Huntersville soils are moderately well drained and are upslope and adjacent to Staples soils.  The Friendship and Meehan soils are on similar positions and are sandy to depths of 40 inches or more.  Well drained Redeye soils are upslope and adjacent to areas of Staples soils.  The poorly or very poorly drained Roscommon soils are in the depressions and interdrumlin areas.  Organic soils, such as Cathro and Markey, in depressions and interdrumlins are also associated in many places."
