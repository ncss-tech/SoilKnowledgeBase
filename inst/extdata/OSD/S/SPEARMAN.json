  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Spearman soils are usually dry, but their upper horizons are occasionally moistened by summer rains of one or more inches intensity.  Mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The hue is 7.5YR through 10R.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick. Depth to hard platy shale is 20 to 40 inches.  Shale fragments throughout the A and B horizons range from 2 to 10 percent and throughout the C horizons overlying bedded shale range from 10 to 50 percent, but the average volume of coarse fragments from 10 inches to the hard platy shale is less than 35 percent.  The A1 horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 through 4, with chroma of 4 occurring below 4 inches.  The B horizon has value of 5 or 6, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 4 through 6.  It is heavy loam or light clay loam with estimated 2 to 5 percent more clay than in the A1 or Ap horizons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Capps, Deacon and Fishers soils lack paralithic contacts at depths of 40 inches or less.  Also, Fishers soils are noncalcareous throughout.  Nucla and Shirk soils have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and the Nucla soils are very deep. Ortiz soils are calcareous throughout the solum and have a Cca horizon. Searing soils have dry value of 4 in the Al horizon, are usually moist and have mean annual soil temperature of 39 to 47 degrees F."

The climate is cool, moist semiarid with mean annual temperature of 45 to 50 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation of 12 to 16 inches, 70 percent of which falls during April through September."
