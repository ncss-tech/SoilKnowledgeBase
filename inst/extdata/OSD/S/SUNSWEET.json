  "OVERVIEW": "The Sunsweet series consists of well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on uplands.  These soils have a dark brown sandy loam Ap horizon with many rounded ironstone nodules and yellowish red sandy clay upper Bt horizons; the lower Bt is coarsely mottled sandy clay.  Plinthite occurs in all horizons beginning at depth of about 8 inches.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  Near the type location the mean annual air temperature is 67 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 46 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 120 inches.  Depth to horizons containing 5 percent or more plinthite ranges from 5 to 15 inches.  Content of rounded ironstone nodules ranges from 5 to 35 percent in the A and Btc horizon, from 0 to 15 percent in the Btv1 and Btv2 horizons and 0 to 5 percent in the lower Bt horizon.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid except where the A horizon has been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 3, 4 or 5, and chroma of 2, 3, 4, 6 or 8.  It is sandy loam, loamy sand or their gravelly analogues.\nThe Btc horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4, 5 or 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  It is sandy clay loam, sandy clay, clay or their gravelly analogues.  Plinthite is 0 to 10 percent.\nThe Btv1 and Btv2 horizons have the same matrix color as the Btc horizon but have few to many red, brown, yellow and gray mottles.  Texture is sandy clay or clay but ranges to sandy clay loam in the Btv1 horizon.  Plinthite is 5 to 35 percent.\nThe Btv3 horizon is medium to coarsely mottled in shades of red, brown, yellow, gray and white, or it has the same matrix color range as the Btc horizon with common to many mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow, gray and white.  Plinthite is 5 to 35 percent.  It is sandy clay or clay.  Clay content of the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon ranges from 40 to 60 percent."

Carnegie soils have more than .5 percent plinthite deeper than 15 inches below the surface.  Cowarts soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section and very firm lower Bt horizons.  Esto soils lack plinthite.  Freemanville soils have plinthite beginning at a depth of 26 inches.

These soils formed in clayey Coastal Plain deposits.  Mean annual air temperature is about 63 to 70 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 43 to 55 inches."
