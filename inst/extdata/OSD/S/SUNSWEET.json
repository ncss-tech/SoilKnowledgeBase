  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 120 inches.  Depth to horizons containing 5 percent or more plinthite ranges from 5 to 15 inches.  Content of rounded ironstone nodules ranges from 5 to 35 percent in the A and Btc horizon, from 0 to 15 percent in the Btv1 and Btv2 horizons and 0 to 5 percent in the lower Bt horizon.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid except where the A horizon has been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 3, 4 or 5, and chroma of 2, 3, 4, 6 or 8.  It is sandy loam, loamy sand or their gravelly analogues.\nThe Btc horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4, 5 or 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  It is sandy clay loam, sandy clay, clay or their gravelly analogues.  Plinthite is 0 to 10 percent.\nThe Btv1 and Btv2 horizons have the same matrix color as the Btc horizon but have few to many red, brown, yellow and gray mottles.  Texture is sandy clay or clay but ranges to sandy clay loam in the Btv1 horizon.  Plinthite is 5 to 35 percent.\nThe Btv3 horizon is medium to coarsely mottled in shades of red, brown, yellow, gray and white, or it has the same matrix color range as the Btc horizon with common to many mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow, gray and white.  Plinthite is 5 to 35 percent.  It is sandy clay or clay.  Clay content of the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon ranges from 40 to 60 percent."

Baxterville, Dothan, Malbis, and Tifton soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the control section and plinthite deeper than 15 inches below the surface.  Carnegie soils have more than .5 percent plinthite deeper than 15 inches below the surface.  Cowarts soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section and very firm lower Bt horizons.  Esto soils lack plinthite.  Freemanville soils have plinthite beginning at a depth of 26 inches.  Varina soils have less than 5 percent ironstone nodules in the A horizon and plinthite beginning at depth of about 38 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sunsweet soils are on the steeper parts of fairly smooth upland landscapes to the Coastal Plain.  These soils occur predominantly on short sideslopes adjacent to streams and other steep parts of the landscape.  Slopes are dominantly 5 to 17 percent but range from 2 to 25 percent.  These soils formed in clayey Coastal Plain deposits.  Mean annual air temperature is about 63 to 70 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 43 to 55 inches."
