Arujo soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to granitic paralithic material, and have a mean summer temperature that differs by greater than 25 degrees F. from the mean winter temperature. Botella, Chico, Corona, Elkhorn, Havala, Kawenga, Lockwood, and Saltcanyon soils are all greater than 60 inches to rock.  McCoy  soils are 25 to 40 inches to granitic paralithic material and have Bt horizons that are slightly to moderately alkaline. Tongva soils lack very gravelly, very cobbly or very stony textures in the lower part of the argillic horizon, and they have paralithic contacts at 20 to 40 inches."
