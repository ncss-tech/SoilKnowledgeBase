  "OVERVIEW": "The Sindion series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone, sandstone, phyllite, siltstone, shale, granite, gneiss, schist, and basalt on flood plains. Permeability is moderate. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

Chiswell and Litz soils are shallower to bedrock and are on uplands. Combs soils contain less clay in the subsoil and are on similar landscapes. Clubcaf soils are poorly drained and are on similar landscapes. Marbie and Wyrick soils have argillic horizons and are in upland drainageways and depressions.  Monongahela soils have a fragipan and are on stream terraces.  Speedwell soils are well drained and on similar landscapes."
