Gravel and cobbles range from 0 to 35 percent in the A, Ap, and Bw horizons and from 0 to 80 percent in the Cg and C horizons. Some pedons contain few to common flakes of mica. Reaction ranges from slightly acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 6.

Allegheny, Chavies, Cotaco, and Wheeling soils have argillic horizons and are on stream terraces. Austinville, Frederick and Groseclose soils contain more clay in the subsoil and are on uplands. Chiswell and Litz soils are shallower to bedrock and are on uplands. Combs soils contain less clay in the subsoil and are on similar landscapes. Clubcaf soils are poorly drained and are on similar landscapes. Marbie and Wyrick soils have argillic horizons and are in upland drainageways and depressions.  Monongahela soils have a fragipan and are on stream terraces.  Speedwell soils are well drained and on similar landscapes."
