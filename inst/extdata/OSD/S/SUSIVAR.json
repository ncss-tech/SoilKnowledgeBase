  "OVERVIEW": "The Susivar series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in stratified loamy alluvium more than 40 inches thick, underlain by very gravelly sand. Susivar soils are on floodplains and low stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 25 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 33 to 36 degrees F. These soils are stratified with textures that include silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, very fine sand, and fine sand. Depth to sands and gravel ranges from 40 to greater than 60 inches. Upon mixing, the control section is coarse-loamy. Organic carbon content varies irregularly with increasing depth. Reaction throughout the profile ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is stratified silt loam, fine sandy loam, and loamy fine sand.\nThe ACg and Cg horizons have hue of 5YR to 5GY; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 4. These horizons have common to many greenish gray through red redoximorphic features present. The individual strata range from less than 1 inch to 18 inches in thickness.\nThe C horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y; value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 to 4.\nThe 2C horizon (where present) is variegated sand and gravel. Coarse fragment content ranges from 40 to 70 percent; 10 to 20 percent cobbles, and 30 to 50 percent gravel."
