    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Saneli soils occupy nearly level flood plains of major streams.  Slopes are mostly less than 1 percent.  The regolith consists of clayey over sandy sediments many feet thick.  The climate is arid with an average annual precipitation of 4 to 12 inches, and a Thornthwaite P-E index of 10 to 15.   The mean annual air temperature ranges from 59 to 68 degrees F."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Surface runoff is very slow.  Water enters the soil rapidly when the soils are dry and cracked, but very slow when the soil is wet and the cracks are sealed.  Internal drainage is slow.  Permeability is very slow."

A field study of the type location is recommended to update the description.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
