  "OVERVIEW": "The Spartabutte series consists of moderately deep, well-drained soils on mountain backslopes formed in colluvium from granitic rocks with loess and minor amount of volcanic ash in surface horizons.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and mean annual temperature about 42 degrees F.",
