  "OVERVIEW": "The Savona series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are deep to calcareous sandy and gravelly outwash. They formed in outwash dominantly of limestone origin on outwash plains and terraces. In some places, the upper part of the solum formed in silty or loamy alluvium or in loess as much as 46 cm (18 inches) thick. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",

Also, Ockley and Wea soils have less clay within the particle-size control section, and Wea soils have a mollic epipedon. The very poorly drained Lippincott and Westland soils are in depressions and have a mollic epipedon."
