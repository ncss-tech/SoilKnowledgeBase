Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in outwash high in limestone gravel and sand, and in some places have a mantle of silty or loamy alluvium or loess as much as 46 cm (18 inches) thick. Climate is humid and temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1118 mm (34 to 44 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 13 degrees C (51 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 160 days. Elevation is 299 to 366 meters (980 to 1200 feet) above mean sea level."

In addition, Eldean soils have loose sandy and gravelly outwash between a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 and 40 inches). Also, Ockley and Wea soils have less clay within the particle-size control section, and Wea soils have a mollic epipedon. The very poorly drained Lippincott and Westland soils are in depressions and have a mollic epipedon."

The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 15 to 76 cm (0.5 to 2.5 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and high or very high in the substratum. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow in the solum and rapid or very rapid in the substratum."
