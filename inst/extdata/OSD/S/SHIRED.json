Organic materials are composed mostly of decayed leaves, twigs, roots and other vegetative material.  Percent fiber ranges from about 5 to 15 percent rubbed and 25 to 40 percent unrubbed.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or their mucky analogs.  In the lower part, medium or coarse gray iron depletion mottles and pockets of sand or loamy sand ranges from none to common.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown and yellow are in most pedons.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."
