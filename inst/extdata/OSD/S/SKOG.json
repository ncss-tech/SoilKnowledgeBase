The somewhat poorly drained Clemens (T) and Rockmarsh (T) soils are on lower landscape positions and have more clay in the series control section. The moderately well drained Dairyland soils are on similar landscape positions but are underlain by dense loamy till. The excessively drained Emmert soils are on slightly higher landscape positions."
