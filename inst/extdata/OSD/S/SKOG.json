  "REVDATE": "07/2005",
  "STATES": "WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Skog series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in a thin mantle of loamy alluvium over sandy-skeletal alluvium on floodplains.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the loamy alluvium and rapid or very rapid in the sandy-skeletal alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
