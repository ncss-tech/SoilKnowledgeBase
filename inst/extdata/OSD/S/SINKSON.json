The mean annual soil temperature is about 42 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is about 59 to 63 degrees F.  The 10- to 40-inch control section is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Fine sandstone or siltstone fragments typically range from 0 to 15 percent but may range to 35 percent.  EC is less than 4 mmhos throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 10R, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  A Bk or Bky horizon is present in some pedons.  Calcium carbonate and gypsum occur throughout this horizon."
