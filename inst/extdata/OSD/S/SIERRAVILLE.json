  "OVERVIEW": "The Sierraville series is a member of the fine, montmorillonitic, frigid family of Ultic Haploxeralfs. Typically, Sierraville soils have reddish brown, slightly acid, stony sandy loam and stony loam A horizons that grade to weak red, slightly and medium acid, heavy clay loam and light clay B2t horizons underlain by volcanic rock at a depth of 75 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a lithic contact of volcanic bedrock is 40 to 80 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is about 43 degrees to 47 degrees F. The soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. from about April 1 to November 1 and above 47 degrees F. from about April 15 to November 1. Mean summer soil temperatures are more than 59 degrees F.  The soil between depths of about 8 to 14 inches is usually dry all of the time from July 15 until November 1 and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year. Rock fragments including stones, cobblestones and gravel range from 20 to 50 percent by volume in the A horizon.  Fragments decrease with increasing depth and range from 5 to 20 percent by volume in the B horizon. The base saturation of all horizons is between 50 and 75 percent. The A horizon is dark reddish brown or reddish brown in hue of 2.5YR or 5YR. Moist chroma is 4 in some or all parts. It is sandy loam and loam. The B2t horizon is reddish brown and weak red in hue of 2.5YR or lOR, and the dry value is more than 1 unit higher than the moist value in some or all parts. It is heavy clay loam or clay and total clay content is 35 to 45 percent. This horizon has subangular blocky or angular blocky structure. It is slightly or medium acid. The upper boundary is gradual or there is a transitional horizon or both."

They formed in residuum weathered from basic volcanic rock.  The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 28 inches. Average January temperature is about 27 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 60 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 43 degrees to 45 degrees F.
