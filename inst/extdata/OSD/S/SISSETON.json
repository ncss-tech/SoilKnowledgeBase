  "OVERVIEW": "The Sisseton series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in calcareous, stratified, loamy and silty glacial drift on uplands. These soils have moderate permeability.  Slope range from 2 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and mean annual temperature about 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Free calcium carbonate is at or near the surface. The control section typically is loam or silt loam.  The pedon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout and has up to 10 percent by volume pebbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7 and 2 to 5 moist, chroma of 2 or 3.  In cultivated areas the Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or silt loam and has common or many accumulations of carbonate.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 35 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  It typically is loam or silt loam but sandy loam strata are common in the lower part.  Few to many, fine and medium, prominent mottles and stains of reddish brown to yellowish brown are inherent to the glacial drift.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 7 to 30 percent."
