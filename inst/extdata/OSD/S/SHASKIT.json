  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is about 50 degrees F. Surface horizons contain 30 to 60 percent volcanic ash, and have bulk densities of less than 0.95. These soils are usually moist between depths of 8 and 24 inches. The top part of the 10 to 40 inch control section averages more than 30 percent volcanic glass, the next part is sand or loamy sand, and the bottom part is loamy with less than 18 percent clay and 15 to 50 percent particles coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 through 8 dry and 3 or 4 moist. It has weak to moderate blocky or granular structure.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, and dry value of 6 through 8. It ranges from ashy sandy loam to sand and is massive or single grained.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, dry value of 5 through 8, and dry chroma of 3 through 6. It is highly stratified, with texture ranging from coarse sand to loamy sand.\nThe 3C, 4C, and 5C horizons have value of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, dry value of 5 through 8, and dry chroma of 3 through 6. It is highly stratified, with texture ranging from  sandy loam to clay loam. Depth to mottles with chroma of 2 or less exceeds 40 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Shaskit soils are on nearly level to undulating stream floors at elevations of 2,500 to 5,500 feet. They formed in glacial outwash and alluvium. These soils occur in a cold, subhumid climate with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 40 inches; the mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F.; and the mean frost free season ranges from 70 to 100 days."
