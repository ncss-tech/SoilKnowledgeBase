  "OVERVIEW": "The Seaside series consists of very shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone.  Seaside soils are on coastal hills and mountains and have slopes of 5 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

Soil reaction is extremely or very strongly acid (pH 4.3 to 5.0).\nThe A horizon is 2.5Y 6/2, 7/2, or 10YR 7/3.  Moist color is 5Y 8/1; 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2; 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3 or 7/2.  Clay content is 4 to 10 percent.\nThe B horizon is 10YR 5/4, 6/3, 6/4, 7/3, 7/4 or 7/6.  Moist color is 10YR 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6 or 7/2.  It is sandy loam with 7 to 12 percent clay."
