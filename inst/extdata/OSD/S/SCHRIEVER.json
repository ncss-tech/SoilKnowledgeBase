  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Schriever soils are on the lower parts of natural levees and in backswamp positions on the Mississippi River alluvial plain and its tributaries. Slope gradient ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Some slopes are short and occur as undulating parallel ridges and swales. Elevation ranges from 0 to 50 feet. Schriever soils formed in clayey alluvium that is dominated by smectites. Climate is humid temperate. Mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 75 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 55 to 70 inches. Annual frost free days range from 235 to 350."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Baldwin, Barbary, Cancienne, Fausse, Gramercy, Harahan, Iberia, and Mhoon series. Baldwin soils are on slightly higher and older landscape positions and have an argillic horizon. Barbary soils are in swamps and have an n-value of 0.7 or more within a depth of 20 inches. Cancienne and Mhoon soils have less than 35 percent clay throughout the upper 40 inches. Fausse soils are on wetter backswamp positions and do not form cracks. Gramercy soils average less than 60 percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section. Harahan soils have a substratum with n-value of 0.7 or more within a depth of 40 inches. Iberia soils have a dark surface more than 12 inches thick and formed in older sediments of the Teche system."

Schriever soils are saturated in the layers between 0 and 0.5 foot during the months of December through April in normal years, and moist in the subsoil layers below that. Some pedons are continuously saturated in the substratum layers between 60 and 80 inches. Schriever soils are flooded for brief to very long durations during most years, unless protected by levees."

    "content": "REMARKS: The series was updated in 12/2004 to make the presence of a Bg horizon optional above the Bssg horizon.  Descriptions and random point data from Terrebonne and St. James Parishes indicate that slickensides may begin in the upper part of the subsoil. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the type location pedon include:\nOchric Epipedon-----0 to 4 inches (A horizon)\nCambic horizon------4 to 80 inches (Bg and Bssg horizons)\nIntersecting slickensides--15 to 80 inches (Bssg horizons)\nAquic conditions----episaturation, reduction and redoximorphic features in the A and Bg horizon and along slickenside faces.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab analyses of samples from the type location pedon and a supporting pedon from St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana were run by NSSL, Lincoln, Nebraska (S02LA-095-002 and S02LA-095-004).\nMLRA = 131\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
