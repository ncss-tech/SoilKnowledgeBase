  "OVERVIEW": "The Sixdollar series consists of deep, well drained soils on ridges and upper backslopes of mountains.  Sixdollar soils are formed in volcanic ash overlying colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
