These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The mantle of volcanic ash is 7 to 14 inches thick with an estimated moist bulk density of 0.80 to 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples. The particle-size control section is 35 to 85 percent rock fragments and 5 to 10 percent clay. Depth to lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 dry.\nThe Bw horizon has chroma of 3 to 4 dry or moist. It is very stony ashy sandy loam or very cobbly ashy sandy loam. It has 10 to 20 percent gravel, 10 to 20 percent cobbles, and 10 to 20 percent stones.\nThe 2C horizons have value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. It is extremely stony sandy loam, extremely stony coarse sandy loam, extremely cobbly sandy loam, very stony sandy loam, or very stony coarse sandy loam.

Slopes are 15 to 65 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from gneiss, granodiorite, and granitic rock with a volcanic ash mantle 7 to 14 inches thick. The climate is characterized by cool, moist summers and cold, wet winters. The average annual precipitation is 35 to 40 inches. The mean January temperature is about 21 degrees F, the average July temperature is about 58 degrees F, and the average annual air temperature is 35 to 40 degrees F. The frost-free period is 60 to 85 days."
