Alsup and Goodson soils have a paralithic contact from 40 to 60 inches. Losantville soils have free carbonates at 8 to 20 inches. Miamian soils have free carbonates from 18 to 40 inches.Morrisville soils have free carbonates at 10 to 30 inches. Shircliff soils have free carbonates at 30 to 60 inches. Useful soils have a lithic contact from 40 to 60 inches. Vincent soils formed in lacrustine deposits with a very low sand content in the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Skrainka soils are on basin-floor remnants and platforms consisting of terraces, footslopes, and ridges. Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent. The soils are primarily developed in colluvium and residuum derived from from basic igneous rocks. The upper material includes colluvial additions from arkose sandstone and acid igneous rocks. The lower material is derived from intrusive mafic rocks which include diabase, basalt, and gabbro. This material is colluvium which may grade with depth to highly weathered residuum below a former strath surface. Mean annual temperature is 54 to 58 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 38 to 48 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Ashton, Delassus, Elk, Irondale, Lamotte, Nolin, Syenite, and Taumsauk series. Ashton and Elk soils are fine-silty and are on lower terraces. Delassus have a low base saturation, are fine-loamy and have a fragipan. They are commonly at higher elevations. Irondale, Syenite, and Taumsauk soils are at higher elevations and formed in materials primarily derived from acid igneous rocks. Syenite is fine loamy. Irondale, and Taumsauk are loamy-skeletal and are on steeper sideslopes. Lamotte soils formed in acid sandstone and are fine-loamy. They are at similar elevations on basin ridges. Nolin soils are fine-silty and are on flood plains."
