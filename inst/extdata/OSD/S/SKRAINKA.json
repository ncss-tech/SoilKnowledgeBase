  "OVERVIEW": "The Skrainka series consist of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in alluvium or colluvium and residuum weathered primarily from basic igneous rocks. These soils are on basin-floor remnants. Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches.",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Skrainka soils are on basin-floor remnants and platforms consisting of terraces, footslopes, and ridges. Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent. The soils are primarily developed in colluvium and residuum derived from from basic igneous rocks. The upper material includes colluvial additions from arkose sandstone and acid igneous rocks. The lower material is derived from intrusive mafic rocks which include diabase, basalt, and gabbro. This material is colluvium which may grade with depth to highly weathered residuum below a former strath surface. Mean annual temperature is 54 to 58 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 38 to 48 inches."

Ashton and Elk soils are fine-silty and are on lower terraces. Delassus have a low base saturation, are fine-loamy and have a fragipan. They are commonly at higher elevations. Irondale, Syenite, and Taumsauk soils are at higher elevations and formed in materials primarily derived from acid igneous rocks. Syenite is fine loamy. Irondale, and Taumsauk are loamy-skeletal and are on steeper sideslopes. Lamotte soils formed in acid sandstone and are fine-loamy. They are at similar elevations on basin ridges. Nolin soils are fine-silty and are on flood plains."
