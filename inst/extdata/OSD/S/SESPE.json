  "OVERVIEW": "The Sespe series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from reddish sandstone and shale bedrock.  Sespe soils are on uplands and have slopes of 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 24 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 63 degrees F. and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F. at any time.  The soil between depths of about 4 and 12 inches is usually dry all of the time from late May until mid-December and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.  Rock fragments of cobblestone size are less than 2 percent and gravel-size fragments are less than 5 percent in all horizons except in the transition to the paralithic contact.  Reddish hue is derived mostly from the parent material.  Base saturation is more than 75 percent in all parts of the soil profile.\nThe A horizon is brown, reddish gray, dark reddish gray, or reddish brown (7.5YR 5/2, 4/2; 5YR 5/2, 4/2, 5/3, 4/3).  It is heavy loam or clay loam.  This horizon has granular or subangular blocky structure and has 3 to 4 percent organic matter in the upper part and 1 to 2 percent organic matter in the lower part.  It is neutral to medium acid.\nThe B2t horizon is dark reddish brown, reddish brown, or weak red (5YR 3/3, 4/3; 2.5YR 5/2, 4/2).  It is heavy clay loam, light clay or sandy clay and has 35 to 45 percent total clay.  The upper boundary of this horizon is gradual or there is an A3 horizon.  The B2t horizon has 5 to 15 percent more clay absolute than the A horizon.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  Some pedons have a B3 horizon or a C horizon up to 10 inches thick above the paralithic contact.  Lime-coatings occur on the upper joints of the sandstone and shale in some pedons."

The soils formed in material weathered from reddish sandstone and shale.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches.  Average January temperature is 50 degrees to 53 degrees F., average July temperature is 67 degrees to 73 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 60 degrees to 61 degrees F.
