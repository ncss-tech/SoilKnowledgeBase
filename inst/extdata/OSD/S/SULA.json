    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are rather uniform throughout most of their distribution.  Where the parent materials are thickest the soils may grade into a substratum of fine sandy loam.  On some of the nearly flat areas the upper part of the subsoil is moderately heavy and tends toward Solonetz development.  In places, these soils are in complex association with thinly developed Solonetz."
