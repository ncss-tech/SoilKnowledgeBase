    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are rather uniform throughout most of their distribution.  Where the parent materials are thickest the soils may grade into a substratum of fine sandy loam.  On some of the nearly flat areas the upper part of the subsoil is moderately heavy and tends toward Solonetz development.  In places, these soils are in complex association with thinly developed Solonetz."

Where underlying material is calcareous, mapping inclusions will include soils that are calcareous in the lower part of their subsoils.\nNote 1:  Provisional Soil survey color names based on Munsell Color Charts, adopted in Staff Conference, 1947.\n* Tentative series proposed in Bitterroot Valley Area, Montana.\nOSED scanned by SSQA.
