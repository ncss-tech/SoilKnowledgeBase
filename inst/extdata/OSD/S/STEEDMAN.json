  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to secondary carbonates ranges from 10 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam, and stony or gravelly phases are recognized.  Rock fragments less than 3 inches in diameter comprise from 0 to 25 percent by volume.  Rock fragments from 3 to 36 inches in diameter comprise from 0 to 50 percent by volume.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid through strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has COLE ranging from 0.07 through 0.12 and is clay or silty clay.  The Bt1 horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The Bt1 horizon has mottles in shades of gray, brown, or red and the reaction ranges from neutral to moderately acid.  The Bt2 horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of gray, red, or brown.  The Bt2 horizon ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have BC horizons which are similar to the Bt horizons.\nThe Cr horizon is grayish, weakly laminated clayey shale or compacted clay that is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  This rock like material is non paralithic and has low to moderate excavation difficulty.  Fractures are greater than 10 cm apart.  It is dense enough to be root restrictive, and slakes in water within 15 hours."

Soils in similar families are Acove, Agan, Axtell, Aydelotte, Bazette, Bluegrove, Bronte, Crockett, Crosstell, Durant, Foraker, Fulshear, Grainola, Katemcy, Lexton, Lindy, Navo, Tabler, Tabor, and Thurber series.  Acove, Bluegrove, Bronte, Fulshear, Katemcy, Lexton, Lindy and Thurber soils have mixed mineralogy and have COLE less than 0.07.  Agan and Aydelotte soils have a solum greater than 60 inches thick and have mixed mineralogy.  Axtell, Crockett, Crosstell, and Tabor soils have a solum greater than 40 inches thick and have an abrupt textural change from the A to the Bt horizon. Bazette soils have a COLE less than 0.07.  Durant, Foraker, and Tabler soils have mollic epipedons.  Grainola soils have mixed mineralogy and are more alkaline in the A and Bt1 horizon.  Nora, Normangee, and Ponder soils have sola more than 40 inches thick."

They formed in material weathered from shale containing thin strata of sandstone of Pennsylvanian age.  The climate is warm and moist subhumid.\nMean Annual Precipitation: 35 to 40 inches.\nMean Annual Temperature: 57 to 68 degrees F.\nThornthwaite Annual P-E indices: 50 to 66."
