  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness typically is between 40 and 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from about 40 to 70 inches.  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages between 12 and 18 percent clay and between 52 and 75 percent sand.  Sand size is mostly fine and medium.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is sandy loam, but in some pedons it is fine sandy loam.\nThe AC horizon and the B horizon, where present, have value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is sandy loam but ranges to loamy sand."

In addition, Ankeny soils have a mollic epipedon that is 24 to 36 inches thick and has a B horizon that is 3 or more in chroma.  Disco soils have a thinner mollic epipedon.  Eyota soils have a silt loam or loam 2B horizon with chroma of 3 or 4.  Lomax soils have chroma of 3 or more in the major part of the B horizon and average less than 52 percent sand in the 10- to 40-inch control section."

These soils formed in dark colored moderately coarse textured alluvium containing 52 to 75 percent sand.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 44 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 28 to 34 inches."
