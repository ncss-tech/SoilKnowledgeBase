  "OVERVIEW": "The Shellwood series consists of moderately well drained, moderately rapidly permeable, calcareous soils on floodplains.  They formed in loamy alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches.",

The 10- to 40-inch control section averages between 12 and 18 percent clay and between 52 and 75 percent sand.  Sand size is mostly fine and medium.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is sandy loam, but in some pedons it is fine sandy loam.\nThe AC horizon and the B horizon, where present, have value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is sandy loam but ranges to loamy sand."

In addition, Ankeny soils have a mollic epipedon that is 24 to 36 inches thick and has a B horizon that is 3 or more in chroma.  Disco soils have a thinner mollic epipedon.  Eyota soils have a silt loam or loam 2B horizon with chroma of 3 or 4.
