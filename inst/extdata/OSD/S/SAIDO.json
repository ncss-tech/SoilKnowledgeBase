  "OVERVIEW": "The Saido series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in silty, calcareous, gypsiferous alluvium on mesas, cuestas, fans and knolls.  Slopes are 1 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
