These soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and reworked lacustrine deposits. Slopes range from 4 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 1,900 to 2,100 meters. The climate is dry, sub-humid with cool moist winters and hot dry summers with the exception of 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September due to summer convection storms. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 350 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
