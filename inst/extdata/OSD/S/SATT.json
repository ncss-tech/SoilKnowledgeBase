  "OVERVIEW": "The Satt series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and reworked lacustrine deposits. Satt soils are on eroded fan remnants with slopes ranging from 4 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 325 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
