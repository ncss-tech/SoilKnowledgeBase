  "OVERVIEW": "The Summers series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum derived from coarse grained sandstone with thin shale strata.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent.  Summers soils are on upland ridges.  Mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
