The particle size control section averages less than 18 percent clay.  Percent coarse fragments range from 20 to 50 percent in the A horizon, 20 to 45 percent in the BA and Bw horizon, 35 to 60 percent in the BC horizon and 50 to 70 percent in the C horizon with the particle size control section averaging more than 35 percent. Reaction is strongly acid through very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe BA and Bw horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.

Slope gradient range from 0 to 25 percent.  Climate is humid continental with long winter snow cover.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 60 inches, frost free days range from 90 to 130 days and elevation ranges from about 3000 to 6000 feet above sea level."

Briery, Gauley, Leatherbark, Mandy Simoda, Snowdog, and Trussel soils lack the thick dark umbric epipedon.  Simoda and Snowdog soils are moderately well drained and have a fragipan.  Snowdog soils also formed in colluvium.  Leatherbark soils are somewhat poorly drained, and Trussel soils are poorly drained and have a fragipan.  Trussel soils also formed in colluvium."
