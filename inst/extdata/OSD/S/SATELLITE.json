  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline in all horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon is a mixture of black (10YR 2/1) organic matter and white (10YR 8/1) sand grains.  When rubbed, this horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 3 to 5.  Texture is coarse sand, sand, or fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, with value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 8.  Upon burning the sand does not change color.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, or red range from none to common.  Texture is coarse sand, sand, or fine sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Adamsville, Broward, Canaveral, Padre, and Panam series in the same family.  Adamsville soils are on similar positions, have coatings of sesquioxides that import a higher chroma to the C horizon, and they have a higher content of very fine sand and available water capacity.  Broward soils are on similar to slightly lower positions and are moderately deep to limestone.  The moderately well drained to somewhat poorly drained Canaveral soils are on similar positions contain sand size=shell fragments throughout.  Padre and Panam soils are on barrier islands and have Ustic moisture regimes."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Satellite soils are on low knolls and ridges on higher elevations in the Lower Coastal Plain.  They formed in regolith of a thick bed of marine sand.  The climate is humid semitropical.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Near the type location, the average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 74 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 330 days."

The poorly drained to very poorly drained Basinger soils are on lower positions and have horizons having some spodic characteristics. The moderately well drained Daytona and Orsino soils have spodic horizons. EauGallie, Immokalee, Myakka, Oldsmar, Orsino and Wabasso soils are poorly to very poorly drained, on adjacent lower positions, and are Spodosols.  The moderately well drained to somewhat poorly drained Pomello soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and are Spodosols.  The very poorly drained Pompano soils are on adjacent lower positions.  Punta and Zolfo soils have a spodic horizon at a depth of more than 50 inches deep. In addition, Punta soils are poorly drained. The excessively well drained St. Lucie soils are on higher adjacent positions.  The moderately well drained Tavares soils are on slightly higher positions."
