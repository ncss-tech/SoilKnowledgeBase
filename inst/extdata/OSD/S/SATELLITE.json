  "OVERVIEW": "The Satellite series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils on low knolls and ridges of the Southern Florida Flatwoods (MLRA 155) and to a lesser extent in the South Central Florida Ridge (MLRA 154), Southern Florida Lowlands (MLRA 156B), Florida Everglades and Associated Areas (MLRA 156A) and the Atlantic Coast Flatwoods (MLRA 153A).  They formed in thick beds of marine sand.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 74 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

When rubbed, this horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 3 to 5.  Texture is coarse sand, sand, or fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, with value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 8.  Upon burning the sand does not change color.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, or red range from none to common.  Texture is coarse sand, sand, or fine sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Adamsville, Broward, Canaveral, Padre, and Panam series in the same family.  Adamsville soils are on similar positions, have coatings of sesquioxides that import a higher chroma to the C horizon, and they have a higher content of very fine sand and available water capacity.  Broward soils are on similar to slightly lower positions and are moderately deep to limestone.  The moderately well drained to somewhat poorly drained Canaveral soils are on similar positions contain sand size=shell fragments throughout.  Padre and Panam soils are on barrier islands and have Ustic moisture regimes."

The climate is humid semitropical.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Near the type location, the average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 74 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 330 days."

The poorly drained to very poorly drained Basinger soils are on lower positions and have horizons having some spodic characteristics. The moderately well drained Daytona and Orsino soils have spodic horizons. EauGallie, Immokalee, Myakka, Oldsmar, Orsino and Wabasso soils are poorly to very poorly drained, on adjacent lower positions, and are Spodosols.  The moderately well drained to somewhat poorly drained Pomello soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and are Spodosols.  The very poorly drained Pompano soils are on adjacent lower positions.  Punta and Zolfo soils have a spodic horizon at a depth of more than 50 inches deep. In addition, Punta soils are poorly drained. The excessively well drained St. Lucie soils are on higher adjacent positions.  The moderately well drained Tavares soils are on slightly higher positions."
