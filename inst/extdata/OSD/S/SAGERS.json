(A horizon)\nCambic horizon:  The zone from 8 to 18 inches.  (Bw horizon)\nSecondary carbonates:  In the zone from 18 to 60 inches.  (Bk and BCk horizons)\nRemarks:\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nThe classification was changed from fine-silty, mixed, active, calcareous, mesic Typic Torriorthents to fine-silty, mixed, active, mesic Typic Haplocambids September 2004 to better reflect the current concept for the series.  The horizonation was also updated.\nTaxonomic Version: Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
