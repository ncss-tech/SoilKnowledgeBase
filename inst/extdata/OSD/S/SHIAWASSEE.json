  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Shiawassee series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are shallow or moderately deep to dense till on till plains. They formed in loamy outwash overlying loamy till. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).",
