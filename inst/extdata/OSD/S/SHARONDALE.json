  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 80 inches and depth to hard bedrock is more than 5 feet. Flat rock fragments, mostly 2mm to 15 inches in length, range from 10 to 85 percent in individual horizons, but average 35 percent or more in the particle-size control section. Clay content ranges from 8 to 27 percent, but is commonly between 12 and 27 percent. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value moist of 2 or 3, dry 4 or 5, and chroma moist of 1 to 3, dry 3 to 5. Texture of the fine-earth is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture of the fine-earth is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. Some pedons display lithochromic mottles in shades of brown, yellow, red, or  gray. Some pedons have very few or few thin discontinuous silt coatings or clay films on faces of peds, and on rock surfaces below a depth of about 30 inches.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture of the fine-earth is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. Some pedons display lithochromic mottling and  discontinuous silt coatings or clay films similar to the B horizon.\nBedrock is hard sandstone or siltstone, and less commonly soft shale."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Palantine series is the only other member of this family. Other soils in similar families include the Guyandotte, Kankakee, Lacrescent, and Marlean, Spivey, and Stock land series. Guyandotte soils are on similar landforms, but lack base saturations of 50 percent in one or more horizons. Kankakee soils are moderately deep to bedrock and formed in loamy alluvium on outwash plains and stream terraces. Lacrescent soils formed in 12 to 50 centimeters of loess, a mixture of loess and loamy colluvium, or in loamy sediments on dissected uplands. Marlean soils formed in 20 to 50 centimeters of loamy glacial or eolian sediments overlying loamy residuum weathered from limestone on ridges, interfluves, and side slopes of dissected uplands. Spivey soils formed in colluvium weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks that accumulates along drainageways, on benches, fans, and in coves of the Southern Blue Ridge Mountains (MLRA 130B). Stockland soils formed in gravelly alluvium on stream terraces and outwash plains."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sharondale soils are mostly in deep coves, or on mountain side slopes on north and east facing slopes (azimuth of about 320 to 140 degrees). Slopes are dominantly 50 to 90 percent, but range from 15 to 100 percent. These soils formed in loamy colluvium weathered from strongly acid to neutral Pennsylvanian aged sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Surface stones or boulders range from .01 to 75 percent of surface coverage, but most commonly areas range from 3 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,000 to 4,000 feet and local relief difference ranges from 800 to 2,500 feet. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 59 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 49 inches."

None of these soils has a mollic epipedon. Caneyville, Gilpin, Renox, and Shelocta soils have argillic horizons. Berks, Caneyville, Dekalb, Gilpin, Marrowbone, and Muskingum soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Caneyville soils are in a fine family. Gilpin, Kimper, Muskingum, Renox, and Shelocta soils are in a fine-loamy family. Fedscreek and Marrowbone soils are in a coarse-loamy family."
