    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sabine soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping beach ridges along the Gulf of Mexico.  These soils formed in sandy sediments of Recent age that were reworked by wind and storm tides and are now stabilized by vegetation.  Mean annual temperature is 70 to 72 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 44 to 60 inches.  Frost free days range from 250 to 270 and elevation ranges from 4 to 12 feet.  The Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 68 to 80."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Baines, Galveston, Mustang, Nass, and Veston series.  Baines soils are Aquolls, are lower in the landscape, and are mapped in a complex with Sabine soils.  Galveston, Mustang, Nass, and Veston soils have a ochric epipedon.  Galveston soils have less than 10 percent silt plus sand and are on about the same landscape position.  Mustang and Nass soils are lower in the landscape and have a water table at or near the surface during most of the year.  Veston soils are slightly lower in the landscape and have a fine-silty particle-size control section."

An apparent water table occurs between 30 and 50 inches most of the year.  The soils are rarely to occasionally flooded for very brief duration during storm surge."

    "section": "SERIES ESTABLISHED",
    "content": "SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Galveston County, Texas; 1984.  The Sabine series was first correlated in Jefferson County, Texas in 1962.  The series was put on the inactive list in 1972 and combined with the Stowell series.  In 1984 the series was reestablished with the correlation of Galveston County.  The type location was placed near the original type location with the 1996 correlation of Jefferson and Orange Counties, Texas"

Data from type location by TAMU supports siliceous (S84TX-167-1).\nSOIL INTERPRETATION RECORD NUMBER: TX0955\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
