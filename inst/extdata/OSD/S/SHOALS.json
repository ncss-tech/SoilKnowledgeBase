    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Soils in similar families are the Bowmansville, Orrville, and Washtenaw series. Bowmansville, and Orrville soils have an active cation-exchange activity class. Bowmansville soils have hue redder than 10YR in the upper part of the series control section. Orrville soils are more acid than neutral in the middle part of the series control section. Washtenaw soils are Aeric Fluvaquents and have a buried soil within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Shoals soils are on flood plains receiving sediments from areas influenced by Wisconsinan or Illinoian glaciation. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in loamy alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1168 mm (32 to 46 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 13 degrees C (47 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 210 days. Elevation is 104 to 305 meters (340 to 1,000 feet) above mean sea level."

Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2.0 feet) during the winter and spring in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderate or moderately rapid in the substratum. These soils are subject to rare to frequent flooding."

Data for other pedons sampled by the Agricultural Experiment Station at Purdue University and at The Ohio State University are also available from KSSL.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
