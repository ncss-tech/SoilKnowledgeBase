  "OVERVIEW": "The Sedalia series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils on uplands.  These soils               formed in a thin mantle of loess and the underlying loamy and clayey residuum from cherty limestone.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 9 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches.",

An E horizon is present in some pedons that have not been cultivated.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bt and 3Bt horizons have mottled colors with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 8.  The 2Bt horizon is gravelly, very gravelly, extremely gravelly, cobbly, very cobbly, or extremely cobbly analogues of silty clay loam or clay loam and the 3Bt horizon is clay, gravelly clay, or cobbly clay.
