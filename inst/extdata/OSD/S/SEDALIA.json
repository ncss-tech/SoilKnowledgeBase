  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the 2Bt horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Chert gravel by volume is 0 to 10 percent in the A and Bt horizons; 15 to 50 percent in  the 2Bt horizon and 5 to 25 percent in the 3Bt horizon.  Chert cobble by volume is less than 5 percent in the A and Bt horizons; 5 to 40 percent in the 2Bt horizon and less than 10 percent in the 3Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has color value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It commonly is silt loam, but includes silty clay loam.  Reaction is medium acid to neutral.  An E horizon is present in some pedons that have not been cultivated.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bt and 3Bt horizons have mottled colors with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 8.  The 2Bt horizon is gravelly, very gravelly, extremely gravelly, cobbly, very cobbly, or extremely cobbly analogues of silty clay loam or clay loam and the 3Bt horizon is clay, gravelly clay, or cobbly clay.  Reaction is medium acid to neutral."
