These soils formed in mixed alluvium from volcaniclastic material and lacustrine deposits.  The climate is hot and dry in summer and cool and moist in winter.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 300 to 380 mm, and average annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 8.4 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 90 to 115 days."
