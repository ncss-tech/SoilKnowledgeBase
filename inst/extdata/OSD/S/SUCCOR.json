  "OVERVIEW": "The Succor series consists of very deep, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in mixed alluvium from volcaniclastic material and lacustrine deposits.  Succor soils are on pediments and landslide deposits.  Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent.  Average annual precipitation is 330 cm and average annual temperature is 8.9 degrees C.",
