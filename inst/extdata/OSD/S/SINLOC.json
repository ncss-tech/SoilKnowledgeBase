  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are always moist and are saturated below 31 inches for more than 90 consecutive days in most years.  They are moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Effervescence is about 52 degrees F. at a depth of 20 inches.  Thickness of the solum is 15 to 30 inches.  Hue is 10YR or 2.5Y.  Sodium saturation is more than 15 percent in the upper 10 inches and decreases with increasing depth.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry.\nThe B horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam and has weak subangular blocky or prismatic structure.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is stratified silt loam, very fine sandy loam within the particle size control section but averages less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser and less than 18 percent clay.  It ranges to sandy loam or loamy sand below the control section.  Vertical or diagonal clastic dikes occur within the C horizon of some pedons."

Sinloc soils occur in an arid climate having an annual precipitation of 6 to 9 inches, with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average January temperature is 27 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 71 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The frost free season is 135 to 180 days."
