  "OVERVIEW": "The Sinloc series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments with a loess mantle.  Sinloc soils are on terraces and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

They are moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Effervescence is about 52 degrees F. at a depth of 20 inches.  Thickness of the solum is 15 to 30 inches.  Hue is 10YR or 2.5Y.  Sodium saturation is more than 15 percent in the upper 10 inches and decreases with increasing depth.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry.\nThe B horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam and has weak subangular blocky or prismatic structure.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is stratified silt loam, very fine sandy loam within the particle size control section but averages less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser and less than 18 percent clay.  It ranges to sandy loam or loamy sand below the control section.  Vertical or diagonal clastic dikes occur within the C horizon of some pedons."
