  "STATES": "AZ,NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The St. Thomas series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite. The St. Thomas soils are on hills and mountains. Slope ranges from 2 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.",

Birdspring soils have mean winter temperatures of 40 to 45 degrees F. and the upper part of the soil profile is frozen for short periods. Dozer soils have a clay content of 18 to 35 percent and does not receive summer precipitation. Mariscal soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 67 to 72 degrees. Saguaro soils are moist in some part for more than than 20 days cumulative from June through August and are typical of the Sonoran desert and MLRA 40."
