  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 63 to 127 cm.  Depth to bedrock is more than 152 cm.  The soil is commonly free of rock fragments but a few pedons contain up to 3 percent gravel.  Stones cover from 0 to 3 percent of the surface.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the surface and subsurface horizons, unless limed, and from strongly acid to neutral in the upper part of the subsoil.  The reaction in the lower part of the subsoil and in the substratum is moderately acid to neutral.\nIn undisturbed areas some pedons have an O horizon that ranges from 3 to 18 cm thick that is neutral or has a hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3 and a chroma of 0 to 2.  It is muck or mucky peat.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has weak or moderate, very fine to coarse granular structure.  Undisturbed areas have an A horizon 5 to 13 cm thick, that has hue of 10YR, value of 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Eg horizon, has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2 and few or common redoximorphic features.  It has weak or moderate, thin to thick platy, fine or medium granular or very fine subangular blocky structure.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2 and has faint to prominent redoximorphic features.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.  It has subangular blocky or platy structure but some pedons have primary structure that is prismatic.  Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe BCg horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, or 5BG value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2 with faint to prominent redoximorphic features.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  It has platy or angular blocky structure but some pedons have primary structure that is prismatic.  Consistence is friable to very firm.\nThe Cg horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y or 10Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 0 to 2 and redoximorphic features are less abundant than in the B horizon or are lacking.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. Platy or prismatic structure is dominant but some pedons are massive. Consistence is firm or very firm.  Patchy or discontinuous oxide coatings are common in the B and C horizons in pedons from marine deposits and are less common or lacking in those from lacustrine deposits."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in the same family.  The Lamoine, Swanton, and Swanville series are similar soils in related families.   Lamoine soils have dominant chroma of 3 or more between the A or Ap horizon and 76 cm below the mineral soil surface.  Swanton soils have a coarse-loamy over clayey particle-size class.  Swanville soils have less clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Scantic soils are on coastal lowlands and river valleys.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  The soils formed in medium, moderately fine and fine textured glaciomarine or glaciolacustrine deposits.  The climate is humid and cool temperate.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 6 to almost 8 degrees C , and mean annual precipitation ranges from 863 to 1219 mm.  The frost-free season ranges  from 90 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from about 2 to 275 m above mean sea level."

The Biddeford, Buxton and Lamoine soils are members of a drainage sequence with Scantic soils on the same landscape, Buxton and Lamoine soils are in higher positions and Biddeford soils are in depressions.  The Elmwood, Melrose, Swanton and Whately soils all have a coarse-loamy over clayey particle-size class.  Elmwood and Melrose soils are in higher positions on the landscape. Swanton soils are in similar positions and Whately soils are in depressions."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Previous revisions reflect a change in classification from Typic Haplaquepts to conform with Keys To Soil Taxonomy, sixth edition, 1994.  Historic correlations of Scantic may have occurred in presumed or isolated frigid areas in MLRAs 144A and 145.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 28 cm (Ap and Eg horizons).\n2.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 28 to 89 cm (Bg horizon).\n3.  Nonacid - the pH is 5.0 or more in 0.01M calcium chloride in at least some part of the control section (25 to 100 cm).\n4.  Aquic conditions - redoximorphic features at 10 cm.\n5.  Episaturation - a perched water table.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Source of data used in establishing taxonomic class and range in characteristics is Maine Agricultural Experiment Station, Technical Bulletin 94, September 1979.\nSoil interpretation record numbers for the Scantic series are: Scantic, ME0044; Scantic, stony, ME0062.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
