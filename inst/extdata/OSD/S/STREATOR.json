Kings and Moline soils average more than 45 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Lanyon and Rosedell soils have carbonates within a depth of 89 cm (35 inches). Mackerlake soils have a sodium absorption ratio that averages more than 8 in the lower two-thirds of the series control section. Marna, Titus, and Woodbury soils average less than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Waldorf soils have a moist bulk density less than 1.55 gm/cc in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Streator soils are level to nearly level areas on till plains or lake beds of Wisconsinan Age. Streator soils formed in loess or silty material and in silty clay or clay till or lakebed sediments. Slope gradients commonly are less than one percent but range to 3 percent. Summers are hot and winters are cold. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8.3 to 11.7 degrees C (47 to 53 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1016 mm (34 to 40 inches), frost-free period ranges from 150 to 185 days, and elevation ranges from 187 to 231 meters (614 to 758 feet) above mean sea level."

The Streator soils are also associated with the somewhat poorly drained Kernan soils which are better drained and have a lighter colored A horizon."

The seasonal high water table is within 30 cm (1 foot) of the soil surface and there is frequent ponding during the period of January through May. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers/s) in the loess or silty material and moderately low to moderately high (0.14 to 1.41 micrometers/s) in the till or lakebed sediments. Permeability is moderately slow in the loess or silty material and slow to very slow in the till or lakebed sediments."
