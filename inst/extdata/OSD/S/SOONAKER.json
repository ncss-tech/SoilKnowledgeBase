  "OVERVIEW": "The Soonaker series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuffaceous sandstone, rhyolitic tuff and other tuffs.  The Soonaker soils are on hills.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
