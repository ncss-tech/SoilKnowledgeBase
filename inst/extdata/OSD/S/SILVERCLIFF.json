The particle-size control section averages less than 18 percent clay in the fine earth fraction, and stratified layers of sand are common.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent and are dominantly less than 3 inches in diameter, but cobble-size fragments are common.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  This horizon is cobbly sandy loam, very cobbly sandy loam, or gravelly sandy loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 or 5.  This horizon is typically sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 0 through 4.  The Cca horizon has 20 to 35 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

Broad Canyon soils are slightly and or medium acid in the control section.  Fairydell, Farlow, Kamack, Midelight, Midfork, Sebud, and Tiban soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Also, Farlow and Midelight soils have channery coarse fragments and have a lithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Greyback and Midfork soils lack a calcic horizon.  Foxmont, Grafen, and Rockabin soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Handran, Klug, Lag, Maurice, McCort, Sup, Thornburg, Tineman, and Wareagle soils lack continuous horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation.
