Average summer temperature ranges from 61 to 63 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 100 days."

Blacknoll soils lack a mollic epipedon.  Jipper soils are deep to basalt.  Katseanes soils are shallow and have an argillic horizon.  Nayrib soils are very shallow and are on pressure ridges of the basalt plain. Pinebutte soils have an argillic horizon.  Vadnais soils have an argillic horizon.  Snowshoe soils are coarse textured windblown deposits over finer textured material and are more than 60 inches deep.  Wolverine soils are on stabilized dunes and lack a cambic horizon.  The Katseanes and Pinebutte soils are in areas of higher elevation with more precipitation.  Snowshoe and Wolverine soils are on stabilized sandunes."
