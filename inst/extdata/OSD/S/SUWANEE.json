  "OVERVIEW": "The Suwanee series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slow permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, siltstone and shale on valley floors, flood plains, stream terrace, and alluvial fans. Slope is 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches.",
