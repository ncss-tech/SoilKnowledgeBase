  "OVERVIEW": "The Squatterflat series consists of very deep, well-drained soils on eroded mountain valley terraces. Squatterflat soils formed in colluvium derived from andesitic tuff and tuff breccia over alluvium derived from mixed sources with an influence of volcanic ash in the upper part.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and mean annual temperature about 44 degrees F.",
