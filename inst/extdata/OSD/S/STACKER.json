  "OVERVIEW": "The Stacker series consists of moderately deep, well drained, soils that formed in loess over basalt. Stacker soils are on plateaus, hillslopes, footslopes, and benches. Slopes are 2 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
