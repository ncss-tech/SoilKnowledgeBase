    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The Sawdust soils typically have carbonates to the surface but some pedons are  leached to a depth of 4 inches. The depth to bedrock is more than 40 inches.  Rock fragments which are dominantly pebbles and channers range from 5 to 45 percent by volume in the upper 10 inches.  They range from 35 to 90 percent by volume in the control section and are dominantly channers and flagstones.  Some pedons have a thin O horizon.\nThe A horizon has 7.5YR or 10YR hue, value of 3 to 6 dry and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is gravelly loam, gravelly silt loam or channery loam, but is loam or silt loam, channery silt loam, very channery loam, very gravelly loam or very gravelly silt loam in some pedons.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  When the A horizon is thicker than 6 inches, the lower part has value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 moist.\nThe AC horizon has 5 YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR hue; value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist; and chroma of 2 to 5.  It is loam or silt loam and contains up to 50 percent coarse fragments of rock.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has 2.5YR through 10YR hue, value of 5 to 8 dry and 4 to 7 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sandy loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, loam or clay loam and contains 35 to 90 percent coarse fragments.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline."

These soils formed in colluvial or residuum weathered from calcareous limestone or sandstone. Mean annual temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 26 inches."

The Gurney soils have bedrock at depths between 20 and 40 inches and have an argillic horizon and are in open areas.  The Hopdraw soils contain more sand and are on similar landscapes.  The Paunsaugunt soils are shallow to bedrock and are on higher convex areas in the landscape.  The Vanocker soils have an argillic horizon and are on similar landscapes with a more dense cover of trees."
