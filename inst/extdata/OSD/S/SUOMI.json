The particle size control section averages 20 to 40 percent fine sand and coarser and 35 to 50 percent clay. Rock fragments of mixed lithology range from 1 to 8 percent by volume throughout the profile.\nSome pedons have Oa or Oe horizon (duff), 1 to 3 inches thick, with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value 2 or 3 and chroma 0 to 2. It is comprised of partially or well decomposed leaves, twigs, and other forest flora.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 0 to 2, or is neutral. It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or very fine sandy loam. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe B/E horizon has properties of the Bt and E horizons respectively.\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silty clay, clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Suomi soils are on linear to convex surfaces of ground moraines, end moraines and bedrock controlled moraines. They formed in calcareous glacial till. The materials are of Late Wisconsin Age and contain significant areas stratified with glacio-lacustrine sediments. Slopes are 2 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 23 to 28 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 41 degrees F. The frost free period ranges from 90 to 120 days. Elevation above sea level ranges from 1200 to 1450 feet."
