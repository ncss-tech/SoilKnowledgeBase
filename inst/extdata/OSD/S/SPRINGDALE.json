  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Springdale soils are on terrace treads and risers. Elevation is 425 to 1,225 meters. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent. Springdale soils formed in sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial deposits mixed with minor amounts of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 375 to 600 mm. The mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C. The frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."

Bisbee, Dart, Hagen, and Marble soils are sandy and are on terraces. Cedonia and Hunters soils are fine-silty and are on terraces. Clayton, Donavan, Hudnut, Phoebe, and Stevens soils are coarse-loamy. In addition, Donavan, Phoebe, and Stevens soils have a mollic epipedon. Clayton soils are on lake terraces and Stevens soils are on side slopes of hills and mountains, and Hudnut and Phoebe soils are on outwash terraces. Garrison and Raisio soils are loamy-skeletal and have a mollic epipedon. Garrison soils are on outwash terraces and Raisio soils are on side slopes of mountains. Spens soils do not have a cambic horizon and are on terrace escarpments. Wapal soils do not have a cambic horizon, are frigid, and are on terrace escarpments. Winthrop soils have a mollic epipedon and are on fans and terraces."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for urban development, homesites, timber production, livestock grazing, recreation and wildlife habitat. The potential natural vegetation is ponderosa pine with an understory of common snowberry, white spirea, Saskatoon serviceberry, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, arrowleaf balsamroot, creeping barberry, silky lupine, and pinegrass. At higher elevations some Douglas-fir is in the overstory."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon -- 0 to 18 cm (Oi, A, AB horizons)\nCambic horizon -- 8 to 33 cm (AB, Bw horizons)\nVitrandic feature -- 3 to 33 cm (A, AB, Bw horizons)\nParticle-size control section -- 28 to 103 cm (part of the Bw, C1, part of the C2 horizons)\nThis soil occurs in four soil survey areas; Spokane, North Ferry, Okanogan, and Stevens County. The classification of the Springdale pedons in the Spokane, Stevens, and Okanogan reports should probably be Vitrandic Haploxerepts; in the North Ferry report the classification should be Vitrandic Haploxerolls and a new series was established called Leiko.\nSpringdale soils should be further investigated to determine typical mineralogy (isotic vs. mixed).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Partial laboratory data is available for this series. Sample number S57WA063-8, pedon number 40A1036, NSSL, Lincoln, NE 8/87.\nTaxonomic version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
