  "OVERVIEW": "The Sumine series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Sumine soils are on hills, mountains, and plateaus.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
