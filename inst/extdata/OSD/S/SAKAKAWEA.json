  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 10 inches thick.  The soil typically contains carbonates to the surface.  Some uncultivated pedons do not effervesce in the upper 7 inches before mixing.  The 10-40 inch control section has a noncarbonate clay content of about 10 to 18 percent.  It has a carbonate clay content of about 2 to 8 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have a thin ABk horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam.  The CaCO3 equivalent ranges from 20 to 30 percent.  Some pedons have a BCk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has massive structure and is stratified.  It is loam or silt loam in the upper part and silty clay, silty clay loam, silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand in distinct layers in the lower part.  Mottles are relict and vary widely in amount and distinctness between pedons.  Few to common, fine or medium nests of gypsum are in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Huffton (T) series in the same family and the Kiev, Maschetah, Rondell, Zahl, and Zell series.  Huffton soils have salts in the Bk horizon.  Kiev soils are fine-loamy.  Maschetah and Rondell soils are fine-silty.  In addition, Rondell soils are moderately well drained and have a water table at 4 to 6 feet.  Zahl soils have a loam or clay loam Bk horizon, do not have a stratified C horizon, and contain coarse fragments throughout the profile.  Zell soils do not have a calcic horizon and are moist for longer periods of time in the soil moisture control section."

The soils formed in calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments of mixed mineralogy.  The climate is cool semi-arid.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 17 inches."

Inclusions of these families are expected in mapping.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 7 inches (after mixing); calcic horizon - the zone from 6 to 21 inches (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory sample S86ND061-301\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
