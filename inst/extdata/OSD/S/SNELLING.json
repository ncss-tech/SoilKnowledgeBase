  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 65 degrees F and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F at any time. The soil between depths of about 5 and 15 inches usually is dry all of the time after late April until late November or early December and usually is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year. Coarse and very coarse sand are more than 20 percent in both A and Bt horizons.\nThe A horizon has dry colors of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 5/3, 5/4 or 6/3. Moist value or chroma is 4 or more. It is sandy loam or loam and is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has dry colors of 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4, 7/4; 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6, 6/4, 6/6, 7/4 or 5YR S/4. Moist colors are 1 or 2 units of value darker. It is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay. Absolute clay increase from the A to Bt horizon is 4 to 12 percent. It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has dry colors of 10YR 7/3, 8/4; 7.5YR 6/4, 6/6 or 5YR 4/6. It is sandy loam or loamy sand. Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline but non-calcareous."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Arbuckle, Blasingame, Borden, Bressa, Fallbrook, Montpellier, Pomo, Sesame, Tivy, WasioJa and Wyman series. Arbuckle, Pomo and Wyman soils have less than 20 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the control section. Blasingame, Bressa, Sesame and Tivy soils are all less than 40 inches deep to a lithic or paralithic contact. Borden soils are moderately alkaline in the Bt horizon becoming calcareous with depth. Fallbrook soils have transitional horizons between the A and Bt horizons and the 3t and C horizons. Montpellier soils have hue of 2.5YR and 5YR in the Bt horizons. WasioJa soils are calcareous in the argillic horizon and are aridic bordering on xeric."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Snelling soils are nearly level to moderately steep and are on terraces at elevations of 150 to 2,000 feet. They formed in moderately coarse textured alluvium high in coarse sand and derived from granite and similar kinds of rock. The climate is dry, subhumid with 12 to 20 inches of precipitation. The average January temperature is about 45 degrees and average July temperature is about 70 to 76 degrees F and the mean annual temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F. The freeze free season averages about 250 days."

Pentz and Peters soils are less than 20 inches deep to a paralithic and lithic contact respectively."
