    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil has a udic moisture regime, but has a short dry period of less than 45 consecutive days during summer. The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F. The difference between mean summer and winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F. under canopy cover. In forested areas, an O horizon is 2 to 4 inches thick. The particle-size control section is medial loam, medial silt loam, medial silty clay loam, or medial clay loam, and is 18 to 30 percent clay. The particle-size control section has an estimated phosphate-retention of 95 to 100 percent, Alox +  Feox of 2.0 to 4.0 percent, moist bulk density of 0.55 to .090 g/cc, and 15-bar moisture (dried) of 20 to 30 percent. The solum commonly has hue of 5YR, but ranges to 10YR or 7.5YR in one or more horizons in some pedons. The umbric epipedon is more than 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and 2 or 3 dry. Texture is medial loam or medial silt loam. It is 0 to 10 percent flecks of charcoal. In some pedons the gravel is fired peds where associated with charcoal. There are 0 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 20 percent paragravel. It has 10 to 15 percent organic matter and a melanic index greater than 1.7.\nThe Bw horizon has moist value of 2 or 3 to a depth of 20 inches and 3 or 4 below 20 inches, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist above 20 inches and 3 or 4 moist and dry below 20 inches.  Texture is is medial silt loam, medial loam, medial clay loam, or medial silty clay loam in the upper part of the Bw horizon to a depth of 36 inches or more.  The lower part ranges to clay loam or silty clay loam. It has 0 to 20 percent paragravel; 0 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles above 40 inches and ranges  to 35 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles below 40 inches.\nA BC horizon is present in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Salander soils are on coastal hills, mountains and headlands at elevations of 50 to 1,800 feet. Slopes are dominantly 12 to 50 percent, but range from 0 to 90 percent. The soils formed in mixed colluvium and residuum dominantly from igneous rock, including small areas of basaltic sandstone. The marine climate is typified by cool wet winters and cool moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 110 inches. The mean January temperature is 43 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 60 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 53 degrees F. The frost-free season is 120 to 260 days."

Millicoma soils are less than 40 inches deep to bedrock and are skeletal. Templeton soils have an umbric epipedon less than 20 inches thick and have a fine-silty particle-size family class.  All of these soils are on summits and side slopes of coastal hills and mountains."
