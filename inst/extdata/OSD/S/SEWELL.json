  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:\nMajor Uses: Wildlife habitat and recreational areas. The rough topography and coarse fragment content of unreclaimed areas make it impractical for agriculture and difficult for standard forest harvesting practices. A few reclaimed areas are used for hay or pasture, and increasingly, are also used for homesites. Reclaimed areas typically exhibit higher bulk densities, much lower saturated hydraulic conductivities and low organic matter in the surface horizon, making establishment of most vegetation difficult.\nDominant Vegetation: Unreclaimed areas are naturally seeded deciduous forests with some barren areas. Reclaimed areas are usually open grassland, including some legumes. A few reclaimed areas have been planted to trees, but mortality is high because of soil compaction."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: (1) Sewell soils were previously mapped as a variety of strip mine spoil and udorthents units. (2) Mineralogy data and other West Virginia University studies were used for supporting data. (3) In West Virginia, these soils are formed by mine spoil from the New River geologic formation.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 10 cm (A horizon)\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 200 cm\nBrown sandstone rock fragments make up 65 percent or more of the total rock fragment content in the particle-size control section.\nThe 8/00 revision updates this series to the 8th edition Keys to Soil Taxonomy standards. The CEC activity class placement is based on similar soils such as Fiveblock. The COMPETING SERIES section was also updated.\nPrevious revisions: 2/88-BLW,JWB, LDS; 8/00-DHK"
