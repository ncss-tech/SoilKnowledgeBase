    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 45 to 80 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 5 feet but is normally less than 10 feet.  This soil is medium acid to very strongly acid.  Fragments of siltstone, sandstone, or shale ranges from 0 to 35 percent through the particle size control section and up to 45 percent below the control section.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Horizons with value of 3 are less than 6 inches thick.  The texture is silt loam or loam and rarely silty clay loam or clay loam where severely eroded.\nThe E horizon where present, has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.\nMany pedons have a transitional horizon between the A or E horizon and the Bt horizon and between the Bt and C or R horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons also have a hue of 2.5YR, value of 3 and chroma of 6 in the lower part.  The texture is silty clay loam or clay loam and some pedon have subhorizons of silt loam or loam.\nSome pedons have a C horizon with colors and textures like the Bt horizon and some pedons have a Cr horizon."

The Albemarle, Allegheny, Arcola, Bedington, Bucks, Butano, Chester, Chetwynd, Chilmark, Clymer, Collington, Cowee, Edgemont, Edneytown, Elsinboro, Frankstown, Freehold, Gilpin, Junaluska, Leck Kill, Matapeake, Meadowville, Murrill, Nixon, Pineville, Quakertown, Rayne, Shelocta, Syenite, Tate, and Ungers series have hue of 7.5YR or yellower throughout the Bt horizon.  Butano, Cowee, Gilpin, and Junaluska have bedrock at depths less than 60 inches.\nAllenwood soils formed in glacial till.  Arendtsville soils formed in material weathered from a fanglomeate of quartzite, sandstone, and auorhyolite held together in a red sandy matrix.  Aura soils have a higher sand content and less silt.  Birdsboro soils are on terraces and fans and have sola less than 50 inches thick.  Eubanks soils formed in granodiorites on the Piedmont Plateau.  Glenelg soils formed in residuum of micaceous schist on the Piedmont Plateau.  Thurmont soils formed in colluvium and alluvium from crystalline rocks.  Whiteford soils formed in residuum from slate."
