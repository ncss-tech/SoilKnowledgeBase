  "OVERVIEW": "The Stabler series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in pyroclastic flows consisting of volcanic ash and pumice.  Stabler soils are on terraces and backslopes and have slopes of 0 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 80 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in the summer in all parts of the moisture control section.  Mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 48 degrees F.  The particle-size control section contains 0 to 2 percent coarse fragments.  Apparent clay in the control section is 10 to 18 percent.  The soil is moderately acid or slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry.  Shot-like aggregates range from 5 to 20 percent.  Organic matter is 1 to 3 percent.  Sodium flouride pH is 9 to 11 percent, 15-bar water is 12 to 15 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It is medial loam or medial silt loam.  Shot- like aggregates range from 0 to 15 percent in the upper part.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 7 moist and dry, and chroma through 6 moist.  It is medial loam or medial sandy loam."
