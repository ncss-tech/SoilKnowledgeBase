  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 30 to 50 inches thick.  These soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in the summer in all parts of the moisture control section.  Mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 48 degrees F.  The particle-size control section contains 0 to 2 percent coarse fragments.  Apparent clay in the control section is 10 to 18 percent.  The soil is moderately acid or slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry.  Shot-like aggregates range from 5 to 20 percent.  Organic matter is 1 to 3 percent.  Sodium flouride pH is 9 to 11 percent, 15-bar water is 12 to 15 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It is medial loam or medial silt loam.  Shot- like aggregates range from 0 to 15 percent in the upper part.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 7 moist and dry, and chroma through 6 moist.  It is medial loam or medial sandy loam."

The soils formed in pyroclastic flows consisting of volcanic ash and pumice from Mt. St. Helens.  Summers are warm and dry.  Winters are cool and wet.  Annual precipitation is 60 to 95 inches.  Average January temperature is about 32 degrees F.; average July temperature is 63 degrees F.; and the annual temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  Frost- free season ranges from 110 to 140 days."
