The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. These soils receive an additional 2 to 5 inches of run-on moisture from flooding. The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; runoff is negligible; permeability is very slow. These soils are rarely ponded for long to very long periods in some years. After being ponded for a few days, the soil saturates at the surface, forms a perched water table, and wets deeper over time under sustained inundation."
