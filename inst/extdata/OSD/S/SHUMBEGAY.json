    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Aneth (UT), Luning (NV), Soda Lake (NV), Soolake (NV), and Yerington (NV) series.  Aneth soils have SAR of less than 13.  Soda Lake soils have a Bw horizon, lime accumulations below 18 inches and contain few to 20 percent durinodes below 24 inches.  Luning soils are moist 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms.  Soolake soils have a soil temperature that ranges form 48 to 53 degrees F., and do not have secondary lime accumulations at 12 to 24 inches.  Yerington soils have a Bk horizon and do not have thin Btn horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Shumbegay soils are on hummocks and stable dunes of low stream terraces and structural benches.  They formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from Triassic and Jurassic sandstone and siltstone.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,700 to 5,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches, with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 170 days."

Aneth soils occur on eolian-mantled summits of benches.  Tyende soils occur on adjacent summits of benches as areas below stable dunes.  Gotho soils are fine-loamy and occur on low stream terrace surfaces that have less accumulation of eolian material.  Uzona soils are fine textured and occur in broad areas on low stream terraces."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)\nEntisol feature - The absence of diagnostic subsurface horizons.  The Btn horizon does not qualify as a Natric horizon, because it is less than 6 inches (15 cm) thick.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy - Soils classified according to the Eighth Edition, 1998.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Organic carbon and calcium carbonate values are estimated.  Salinity values were determined with an Instant EC salinity kit.  The series type location was sampled for determination of particle-size and SAR, and the samples analyzed at a local soils laboratory in Farmington, New Mexico.  A sample of black greasewood leaves taken at one sample site averaged 7 percent sodium on a dry weight basis.  Release of this accumulated sodium may provide a possible source of sodium for pedogenesis.\nUpdated competing series section.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
