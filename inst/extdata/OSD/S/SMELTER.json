  "OVERVIEW": "The Smelter series consists of very deep, well drained soils that\nformed in alluvium and residuum from andesite, latite, or welded tuff.\nSmelter soils are on foothills and fan terraces and have slopes of 4 to\n30 percent.  Permeability is slow.  The average annual precipitation is\nabout 14 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees\nF.",
