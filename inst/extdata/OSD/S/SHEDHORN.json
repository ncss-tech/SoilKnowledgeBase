  "OVERVIEW": "The Shedhorn series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in colluvium or glacial till derived from consolidated shale or sandstone.  These soils are on glacial moraines, mountainsides, and foot slopes.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F.",
