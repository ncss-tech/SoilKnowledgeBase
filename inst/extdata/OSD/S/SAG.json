Bly and Tusk soils have the top of the argillic horizon above 20 inches.  The Carey Lake soils have sola less than 50 inches thick with BC and 2C horizons with mottles.  Dunford and Mahogan soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Hades soils have sola less than 50 inches thick and lack discontinuity above 60 inches.   Bly, Dunford, and Tusk soils have gravelly argillic horizons.  Marotz soils have Btb horizons and a particle-size control section with 15 to 35 percent gravel.. Nagle soils are calcareous at depths of 17 to 22 inches.  Strom soils are somewhat poorly drained."

They are metastable and are subject to slumping. The soils formed from basaltic colluvium with an influence of volcanic ash and loess in the upper horizons.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 100 days."

Immig soils are moderately deep and are on adjacent south slopes in complex with Gwinly soils."
