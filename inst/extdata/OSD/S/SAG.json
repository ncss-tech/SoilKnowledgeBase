  "OVERVIEW": "The Sag series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium from basalt with an influence of loess in the upper horizons.  Sag soils are on side slopes of hills with typically north and east exposures. Slopes are 12 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
