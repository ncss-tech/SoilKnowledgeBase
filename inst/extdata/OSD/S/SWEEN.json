  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a lithic contact of basic igneous rock is 24 to 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is about 62 degrees to 64 degrees F. and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F. at any time. The soil between depths of about 5 and 15 inches is usually dry all of the time from May until about mid-December and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year. Cobblestones and gravel make up as much as 35 percent of the A and C horizons and up to 25 percent of the B2t horizons in some pedons. Other pedons have as little as 1 or 2 percent rock fragments in all horizons. Base saturation is more than 75 percent in all parts of the profile.\nThe A horizon is gray, dark gray or dark grayish brown (lOYR 5/1, 4/1, 4/2; 2.5Y 4/2). It is loam or clay loam and is neutral to medium acid.  The horizon has weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure. It has approximately 3 or 4 percent organic matter in the upper part and 1 to 1.5 percent in the lower part.\nThe B2t horizon is pale brown, light brownish gray, brown, yellowish brown, light yellowish brown or grayish brown (lOYR 6/3, 6/2, 5/3, 5/4, 2.5Y, 6/2, 6/4, 5/2). It is heavy clay loam or clay and has 35 to 50 percent total clay. Absolute clay increase from the A horizon to the B2t horizon is 10 to 15 percent and the upper boundary of the B2t horizon is clear to gradual. This horizon has moderate to strong angular blocky or subangular blocky structure. It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon is light yellowish brown, pale brown, yellowish brown or light olive brown (lOYR 6/4, 6/3, 5/4; 2.5Y, 6/4, 5/4). It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam to sandy clay loam or clay loam and is mildly or moderately alkaline, but is noncalcareous. The C horizon of soil material is thin or lacking in some pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Gabino and Sespe soils have B2t horizon hue of 5YR or 2.5YK. Los Osos soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 24 to 40 inches, and have an increase (absolute) of 6 to 10 percent clay from the A horizon to the B2t horizon."

They formed in material weathered from basic igneous rock. The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches. Average January temperature is 49 degrees F., average July temperature is 68 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F. The freeze-free season is 260 to 290 days."
