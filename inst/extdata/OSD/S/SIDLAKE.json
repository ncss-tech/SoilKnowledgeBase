  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sidlake soils are on basalt or rhyolite plains and terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  Elevation ranges from 3,200 to 4,600 feet.  The soils formed in eolian material over basalt, latite, vitrophyre, or rhyolite.  Some areas have a slight influence of material weathered from these rocks.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 to 11 inches, the mean annual air temperature is about 45 to 52 degrees F, and the frost free season is 100 to 140 days."

Banbury and Cottle soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to bedrock.  Harsan soils are deep.  Kecko soils are deep and very deep, and lack argillic horizons.  Snowmore soils are moderately deep to a duripan.  Vining soils lack argillic horizon, and are in a coarse loamy family.  These soils are on landscape positions similar to Sidlake soils."
