The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metavolcanic rock that can be dug with hand tools. The climate is cool and arid with moist winters and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation, mostly snow, is 250 to 360 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C; and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
