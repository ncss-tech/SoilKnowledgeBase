  "OVERVIEW": "The Sutro series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metavolcanic rocks. The Sutro soils are on hills and have slopes of 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
