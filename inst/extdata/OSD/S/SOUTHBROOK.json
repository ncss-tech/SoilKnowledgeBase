  "REVDATE": "06/2009",
  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Southbrook series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of alluvium over outwash. These soils are on flats and swales on flood plains and stream terraces in river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. The mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters.",
