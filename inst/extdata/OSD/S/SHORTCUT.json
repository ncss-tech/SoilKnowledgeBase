  "OVERVIEW": "The Shortcut series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in material weathered from granodiorite, anorthosite and gneissic granitic rocks.  They are on mountainsides and ridges at elevations of 2,000 to 5,500 feet.  Slopes range from 25 to 85 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 24 inches, and mean annual temperature is 58 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 14 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at the contact is estimated to be between 59 and 72 degrees F.  The mean January soil temperature varies from 50 to 54 degrees F.  The soil just above the paralithic contact usually is dry from June to mid-November and is moist the rest of the year.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/2, 6/1, 5/4, 4/4 or 4/3; and moist color of 10YR 4/3, 4/1 or 3/3.  It is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand and averages 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments, mostly pebble size.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral (pH 6.2 to 6.6).\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 7/2, 6/3, 6/2, or 5/2; moist color of 10YR 6/3, 5/6, 5/3, 5/2, 4/6 or 4/4.  It is very gravelly loamy sand and averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments, mostly pebble size.  Reaction is medium acid to neutral (pH 5.9 to 6.8).  It grades into highly weathered rock."
