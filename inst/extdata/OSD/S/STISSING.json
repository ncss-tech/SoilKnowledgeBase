  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to the dense substratum commonly is less than 51 cm but ranges up to 51 cm in some places.  The soil ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid except where limed.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam throughout the soil. Rock fragments range from 5 to 50 percent in the A, from 5 to 35 percent in the B and from 10 to 40 percent in the C horizon.  Stones range from 0 to 15 percent in the surface and from 0 to 5 percent in the subsoil and substratum. Flagstones range from 0 to 10 percent in the surface and from 0 to 5 percent in the subsoil and substratum. Channers range from 5 to 25 percent in the solum and from 10 to 30 percent in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of l0YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has weak or moderate, very fine to medium, granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe B horizon has hue of l0YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of l or 2.  It has few to many distinct or prominent iron concentrations.  It is structureless or has weak thin or medium platy or weak or moderate very fine to medium subangular blocky structure.  It is friable or firm.\nThe Cd horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 3.  Chroma of 3 is below 30 inches.  It has common or many, medium or coarse, distinct or prominent iron concentrations which decrease in abundance and contrast with depth.  It is structureless or is geogenically derived, appearing in the form of weak or moderate plates."

Fredon, Lamson, Red Hook, and Raynham soils formed in water sorted materials, do not have a dense substratum and are nonacid.  Leicester soils do not have a dense substratum.  Lyme soils are in a frigid family.  Mansfield, Menlo, and Whitman soils are very poorly drained.  Massena, Newstead, Ridgebury, and Sun soils are nonacid.  Raypol soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stissing soils are nearly level soils in slight depressional areas and on the lower parts of concave slopes.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in loamy till derived principally from dark gray phyllite, slate, shale, and schist. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees Celsius.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1270 mm.  The frost-free period ranges from 120 to 180 days."

Bernardston, Pittstown, Mansfield, and Newport soils are associated in a drainage sequence.  Dutchess, Cardigan, Kearsarge, and Nassau soils are on nearby uplands.  Cardigan and Dutchess soils are well drained and Cardigan soils are moderately deep.  Kearsarge and Nassau soils are shallow to bedrock.  Quonset and Warwick soils are on nearby outwash plains, terraces, eskers, and kames."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity ranges from moderately high or high in the solum and moderately low or moderately high in the substratum.  Runoff is negligible to very low."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Cation-exchange activity class is presumed from a review of data for similar soils.  Changes in competing series may result from updates in classification. The soil meets the current definition of episaturation although there is evidence of saturation in the dense substratum. The soil is described as having some redoximprhic features which decrease with depth in the Cd.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 16 inches (Bg horizon).\n3. Dense till substratum at 16 inches (Cdg horizon).\n4. Episaturation - the zone from 20 to 40 cm is saturated and overlies a relatively impermeable, relatively unsaturated layer.  (Bg horizon and Cdg horizons)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
