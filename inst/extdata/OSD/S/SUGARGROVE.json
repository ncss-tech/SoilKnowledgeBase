  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 25 to 55 inches. Depth to soft bedrock ranges from 20 to 60 inches. Depth to hard bedrock is 40 inches or more. Most pedons have a Cr horizon, commonly between 24 and 50 inches, above hard siltstone or less commonly limestone bedrock. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid. Content of rock fragments range from 10 to 35 percent in A, E, and upper part of the Bt horizons and from 15 to 60 or more percent in the lower part of the Bt and C horizons. Most pedons have transition horizons with colors and texture similar to adjacent horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture of the fine earth is silt loam or loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4 or hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 to 6 and chroma of 4 or 6. Texture of the fine earth is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon, in upper part, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 or 6. Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown and red. Texture of the fine earth is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon, in the lower part, has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles are in shades of brown and red.  Texture of the fine earth is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 8 with mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray. Some pedons do not have a dominant matrix color.\nThe Cr horizon is interbedded, highly weathered siltstone and cherty limestone.\nThe R layer is hard, grayish to brownish siltstone or limestone."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cheaha, Fruithurst, Rion, Rome, Sherless, Sherwood, State, Tidings, and Wickham series in the same family. Cheaha soils are less than 40 inches to hard bedrock. Fruithurst soils have weathered slate at 20 to 40 inches. Rion soils formed in residuum of crystalline rocks of the Piedmont uplands and are underlain by saprolite. Rome and State soils have a solum thickness greater than 60 inches. Sherless and Sherwood soils do not contain coarse fragments of chert. Wickham soils formed in stratified materials and do not have a paralithic contact within 60 inches."
