  "OVERVIEW": "The Sabe series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Sabe soils are on alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 9 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Colorado took over responsibility for the Sabe series and moved the type location to Saguache County.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized are:  an E horizon from 7 to 15 inches; an argillic horizon from 15 to 48 inches that is discontinuous, being made up of lamalae and bands of sandy clay loam in a matrix of loamy sand.  Last updated by the state 4/95."
