    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sandall soils are on mountains, hills, and ridges.  They usually occur on south and west-facing backslope and footslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived mainly from limestone with some sandstone and quartzite.  Some areas are locally influenced by loess.  Slopes are 3 to 60 percent.  Elevations range from 4,300 to 6,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 11 to 14 inches, the mean annual temperature is 46 to 54 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 80 to 140 days."
