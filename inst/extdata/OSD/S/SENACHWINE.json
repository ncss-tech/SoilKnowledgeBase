  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Senachwine soils are on till plains. Slope ranges from 2 to 60 percent. Senachwine soils formed in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying calcareous loamy till. Illite is the dominant clay mineral in the till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 873 to 1076 mm (34 to 42 inches), mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F), frost free period ranges from 152 to 187 days, and elevation ranges from 139 to 300 meters (456 to 984 feet) above sea level."

The moderately well drained Birkbeck and Catlin soils have thicker loess over the till and are on upslope positions. Hennepin soils have lower average clay content in the subsoil. La Rose soils have darker surface layers. Hennepin and La Rose soils are on similar positions."
