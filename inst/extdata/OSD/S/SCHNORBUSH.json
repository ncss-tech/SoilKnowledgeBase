The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 47 to 51 degrees F.  The soil is strongly acid or moderately acid.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The particle size control section is 35 to 60 percent paragravel.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It has granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe B horizon has value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and 3 through 6 dry.  It s loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam and has 0 to 20 percent hard coarse fragments.  This horizon has subangular blocky or angular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have a few mottles or iron stains in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Schnorbush soils are on mountainous uplands at elevations of 200 to 1,400 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 80 percent.  They formed in glacial till and residuum from siltstone.  The soils are in a mild marine climate and have cool, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches.  The average January temperature is about 37 degrees F.; the average July temperature is about 58 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 160 to 200 days."
