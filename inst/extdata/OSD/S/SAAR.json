  "OVERVIEW": "The Saar series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in volcanic ash, colluvium  and glacial till.  Saar soils are on glacially modified mountain sides and have slopes of 3 to 65 percent.   The average annual precipitation is about 95 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

Shuksan soils have more than 8 percent organic carbon in the upper part of the Bhs horizon and are extremely acid in the E and Bhs1 horizon.  GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Saar soils formed in volcanic ash, colluvium, and glacial till.  The soils are on glacially modified mountain sides and have slopes of 3 to 65 percent.  The elevations are mostly from 2,600 to 3,800 feet, but some are as high as 4,500 feet.. Mean annual precipitation is 85 to ll0 inches.  Snow cover lasts from November through May.  The average July temperature is 56 degrees F; the average January temperature is 28 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 110 days."
