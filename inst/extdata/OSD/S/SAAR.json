    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Deming, Hinker, Karta, and Shuksan, soils and the similar Humskel, thader, and Stirrup soils.  Deming and Stirrup soils are more than 40 inches deep.  Hinker, Humskel, and Thader soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Shuksan soils have more than 8 percent organic carbon in the upper part of the Bhs horizon and are extremely acid in the E and Bhs1 horizon.  GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Saar soils formed in volcanic ash, colluvium, and glacial till.  The soils are on glacially modified mountain sides and have slopes of 3 to 65 percent.  The elevations are mostly from 2,600 to 3,800 feet, but some are as high as 4,500 feet.. Mean annual precipitation is 85 to ll0 inches.  Snow cover lasts from November through May.  The average July temperature is 56 degrees F; the average January temperature is 28 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 110 days."
