Rock fragment content, by volume, is less than 2 percent throughout the profile, however individual thin strata may contain up to 10 percent. The particle size control section has greater than 25 percent medium sand or coarser and averages coarse sand.\nSome pedons have a thin Oa horizon (duff layer).\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loamy sand. It averages between 50 to 85 percent fine sand or coarser with a clay content of 2 to 10 percent. It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loamy sand. It is very strongly acid to moderately acid. It typically has distinct to prominent Fe concentrations.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 6. It is coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, and sand. It is strongly acid to slightly acid. It typically has distinct to prominent Fe concentrations.\nSome pedons have a Cg horizon."
