It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loamy sand. It averages between 50 to 85 percent fine sand or coarser with a clay content of 2 to 10 percent. It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loamy sand. It is very strongly acid to moderately acid. It typically has distinct to prominent Fe concentrations.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 6. It is coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, and sand.
