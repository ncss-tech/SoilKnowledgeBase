  "OVERVIEW": "The Saltcanyon series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed on alluvial fans.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  Slope ranges from 1 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
