  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 46 to 94 cm.  Residuum in the form of highly fractured bedrock (2Cr horizons) or non-cemented saprolite (2C horizon), where present, is at a depth of 50 to 145 cm. Depth to hard bedrock ranges from 100 to 150 cm. Rock fragments of gravel, channers, and cobbles range from 5 to 25 percent in the solum and the substratum.  Parachanners typically range from 0 to 15 percent in the subsoil and 5 to 20 percent in the till substratum where presesnt.  Parachanners, channers and flagstones range from 20 to 75 percent in the residual substratum. Very friable remnants of highly weathered gravel-sized pelitic limestone are present in some pedons in the subsoil and substratum. These remnants are intact within the profile but are easily crushed when rubbed between the fingers. Reaction in unlimed areas is strongly acid to neutral in the mineral surface and subsoil. Reaction in the substratum ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline. Average clay content in the particle-size control section is 5 to 15 percent.\nForested areas have an Oe horizon, if present, with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Ap, or A horizon where present, has hue of 10YR, and value and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have BC and/or C horizons with hue of 5Y to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe 2C horizons have inter-layered hues of 5YR to 2.5Y, values of 2 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8. Texture is dominantly silt loam in the fine-earth fraction, but is loam or sandy loam in some pedons.\nSome pedons have residual 2Cr horizons underlying the 2C horizons with colors and textures like the 2C horizons. The 2Cr horizons are dominantly extremely weakly to moderately cemented bedrock. They are up to 66 cm thick. They constitute paralithic material."

The soils formed in glacial till over residuum derived from limestone-interbedded phyllite, calcareous metasiltstone, or pelitic limestone bedrock.  Surface stones and boulders range from 0 to 3 percent. Elevations are 50 to 110 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 1000 to 1135 mm. The mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free period is 115 to 155 days."

The very deep moderately well drained Chesuncook soils, and the very deep somewhat poorly drained Telos soils formed in lodgement till, and are on side slopes and toe slopes. Corinna soils are shallow to bedrock, and are on slightly convex summits and shoulder slopes. Penobscot soils are moderately deep to bedrock, and are on slightly convex summits and upper side slopes. Kenduskeag soils are very deep and somewhat poorly drained on foot slopes.  Wassookeag soils are deep, moderately well drained, and are on smooth to slightly concave summits and side slopes."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series is named for Sebasticook Lake in southwestern Penobscot County, Maine. This soil is part of a proposed catena of soils that include Corinna, Penobscot, Kenduskeag and Wassookeag. They developed in till that is shallow to deep to calcareous metasedimentary bedrock of the Waterville Formation and the Sangerville Formation in central Maine. In comparison to other soils of the region they have a higher base saturation, nutrient availability, and water-holding capacity. They are considered agriculturally productive, particularly for potatoes and similar row crops.\nCharacterization data for this pedon is isotic but not all sampled Sebasticook pedons were isotic. Some were mixed. Given the variability in the series as sampled and the landform system for the catena being dominantly mixed mineralogy, mixed is selected as representative for the series concept.\nFeatures similar to those described as remnants of highly weathered pelitic limestone, were historically described as \"limestone ghosts\" in some places.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 33 cm (Ap horizon)\n2. Cambic horizon - from a depth of 33 to 56 cm (Bw horizon)\n3. Lithologic discontinuity - at a depth of 56 cm (2C1 horizon)\n4. Lithic contact - at a depth of 109 cm (2R layer)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Primary characterization samples from pedon 03N0759, samples 03N03777 through 3783, from Penobscot County, Maine, samples by SSL, Lincoln, NE, 09/04.  Additional characterization samples from pedons 05N0221, 05N0229, 05N0232, and 05N0234, from Penobscot County, Maine, samples by SSL, Lincoln, NE, 2004.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
