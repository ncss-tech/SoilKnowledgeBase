It's a new subgroup and the mollic epipedon is over 50 centimeters thick. Converted measurements from English to metric and converted to semi-tabular format. Added soil moisture regime, soil temperature regime, mean annual soil temperature, particle size clay and sand content. Added clay and sand content and reaction to horizon data in RIC. Updated competing series. Updated geographic setting. Increased mean annual precipitation to 33 inches from 32 inches and added frost free period based on climate data. Updated geographically associated soils. Changed permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity and added flooding frequency. Added ponding frequency and changed runoff to high.\n10/2014 DJK\nUpdated horizonation of typical pedon. Added horizon from 160 to 200 using pedon description from the site. Changed top depth to carbs from 15\" to 20\". Lowered A horizon reaction from moderately alkaline to slightly alkaline. Lowered sand contents from 15 to 10 for all horizons. Added SAR ranges to RIC. Added Bss and Bkss horizons to RIC. Added elevation and precipitation pattern to geographic setting. Changed MAP from 24-33\" to 28-34\". Added KSSL characterization pedons to additional data.\nFuture study needs to check if these soils should be classified as Vertisols.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Physical and chemical data for the typical pedon is available from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska pedon ID: 79KS041001 (sample numbers 791649-791700). Additional KSSL data is available for S01KS027001, 88KS061326, and 11KS029001.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
