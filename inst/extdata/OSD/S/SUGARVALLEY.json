Appleriver soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Blair, Bunkum, Fishhook, Freeburg, Geff, Keene, and Muren soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Glenford soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity within a depth of 127 cm (50 inches). Reesville soils formed entirely in loess and do not have a 2B horizon. Torox soils have moist bulk density of less than 1.70 g/cm3 in the lower part of the series control section. Xenia soils average more than 10 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sugarvalley soils are on ground moraines of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in loess and in the underlying water modified till. The till is dense but is not restricting to root and water penetration. Climate is humid and temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1118 mm (34 to 44 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 13 degrees C (51 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 160 days. Elevation is 317 to 349 meters (1,040 feet to 1,145 feet) above mean sea level."

The poorly drained Cyclone, Ragsdale, and Treaty soils are in depressions. Fincastle soils are on slight rises on the same landform and are underlain by dense till that is restricting to root and water penetration. The moderately well drained Morningsun and Xenia soils are on higher or slightly more sloping areas. Morningsun soils do not have redoximorphic features in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Xenia soils are underlain by dense till that is restricting to root and water penetration."

    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was formerly mapped as Reesville series in the Preble County Soil Survey published in June 1969. Field investigations indicate that these soils in the Boston Plains area formed in loess and the underlying water modified till that is dense but not restricting to root and water penetration.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 41 cm (Ap, BE horizons).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 41 to 129 cm (Bt, 2Bt horizons).\nAquic conditions: redox depletions and concentrations in all horizons between 25 and 200 cm.\nRevised 04/2015 to update competing series differentiae (Glenford) and to update terminology used to describe redox features in profile.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data are available for PB-78, the typical pedon, and PB-74 from the Soil Characterization Laboratory at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
