Field investigations indicate that these soils in the Boston Plains area formed in loess and the underlying water modified till that is dense but not restricting to root and water penetration.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 41 cm (Ap, BE horizons).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 41 to 129 cm (Bt, 2Bt horizons).\nAquic conditions: redox depletions and concentrations in all horizons between 25 and 200 cm.\nRevised 04/2015 to update competing series differentiae (Glenford) and to update terminology used to describe redox features in profile.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data are available for PB-78, the typical pedon, and PB-74 from the Soil Characterization Laboratory at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
