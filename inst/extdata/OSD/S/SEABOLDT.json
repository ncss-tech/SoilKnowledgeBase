Neiman; and David W. Roberts. 1991. Forest habitat types of northern Idaho: a second approximation. General Technical Report INT-236. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Intermountain Research Station.)\n6/2016--This official series description was updated as part of the final correlation of the Spokane County, Washington, soil survey. The series describes the soils formerly mapped as Gibbs taxadjunct. The primary taxadjunct feature is the coarse-loamy particle-size control section that is dominantly coarser glaciofluvial parent material. The formatting was updated according to SSR1 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
