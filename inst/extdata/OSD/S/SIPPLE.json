The Absarook, Archmesa, Burtoner, Gurney, Hoppers, Jeffcity, Maudlin, Moen, Moento, Pianohill and Watrous soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Beartooth soils have 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the Bk horizons. The Beeno, Reeder, and Reedwest soils are moderately deep to a paralithc contact. The Bielenberg, Bookcliff, Clancy, Placerton, Snakejohn, and Ulrant soils are deep to a lithic contact. The Clasoil, Farside, Hangdo, Hyalite, Kokoruda, Sponseller, Trag, Tragmon, and Trazuni soils do not have horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation. The Dooley, Doughty, Felor, Livona, and Meagher soils are moderately deep to a lithologic discontinuity. The Empedrado, Fairfield, Farnuf, Martinsdale, Trujillo, Vida, Watne, Williams, and Yegen soils do not have lithologic discontinuities. The Greenway soils have a lithologic discontinuity at 15 to 25 inches."

The climate is cool with long cold winters and moist springs and summers. Mean annual precipitation is 17 to 22 inches. Mean annual temperature is 39 to 43 degrees F. The growing season is 90 to 110 days."
