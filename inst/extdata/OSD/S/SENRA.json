    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Senra soils are on lava plateaus. These soils formed in volcanic ash and residuum derived from basalt or tuff-breccia. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. Elevations range from 1,280 to 1,540 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
