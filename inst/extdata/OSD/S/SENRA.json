  "OVERVIEW": "The Senra series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over residuum derived from basalt or tuff-breccia. Senra soils are on lava plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
