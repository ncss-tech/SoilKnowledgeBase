  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature is 55 degrees to 59 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is moist in some part from October until sometime in August.  Moisture in the summer is due, in part, from heavy fog and low evapotranspiration rates.  It is dry in all parts less than 45 consecutive days in August and September.  Base saturation is less than 50 percent throughout the solum but commonly increases slightly with increasing depth.  Organic matter is 1 percent or more to a depth of less than 20 inches.  Reaction is very strongly acid to medium acid commonly becoming less acid with increasing depth.  Gravel ranges from 5 to 15 percent.  Clay averages 18 to 27 percent in the particle-size control section and there is only 1 or 2 percent more clay in the B horizon than the A horizon.  The soil is loam or sandy loam.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2 or 5/3 in the upper part and 10YR 5/3, 6/2, 6/3 or 6/4 in the lower part.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2 or 3/3 in the upper part and 10YR 3/2, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2 or 5/3 in the lower part.  This horizon has moderate granular or moderate subangular blocky structure.\nThe B2 horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/6, 6/8, 8/3, 8/4, 7/6 or 8/6 and moist color of 10YR 5/6, 5/8, 7/3, 7/4, 6/6, 7/6, 5/4, 3/3, 4/3, 4/4, 4/6 or 6/3.  It has weak granular to moderate subangular blocky structure."
