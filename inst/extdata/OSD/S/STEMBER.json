  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days during summer and fall.  After the upper 7 inches are mixed, the entire soil is calcareous.  A calcic horizon is at a depth of 9 to 20 inches and a lithic contact with basalt is at a depth of 20 to 35 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 19 to 24 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and is 35 to 65 percent rock fragments.  The mollic epipedon is 12 to 20 inches thick and includes the A and Bk horizons.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  It is gravelly silt loam or silt loam.\nThe Bk horizon, when present, has chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is very cobbly silt loam, very gravelly silt loam or gravelly silt loam.\nThe 2Bqk horizon has value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly loam, extremely cobbly loam, or very cobbly loam.  The coarse fragments include 20 to 50 percent lime-silica cemented fragments and 15 to 30 percent lime-silica coated basalt fragments."

Elevations range from 1,400 to 3,400 feet.  Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 125 to 135 days and up to 180 days in Idaho."
