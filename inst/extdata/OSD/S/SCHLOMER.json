  "OVERVIEW": "The Schlomer series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to laminated, soft siltstone and shale.  They formed in loess over semi-consolidated siltstone and shale.  These soils are on terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 8 inches and average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

These soils are continuously dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches from about May 1 to October 1, unless irrigated.  Depth to siltstone or shale ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to secondary lime ranges from 15 to 26 inches. Rock fragments range from none to a trace in the control section.\nThe Ap1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It has strong or moderate platy or granular structure.\nThe Ap2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  It has weak to moderate coarse platy or prismatic structure.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y with value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  It has weak to moderate prismatic or subangular blocky structure.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y with value of 7 or 8 dry and 5 or 6 moist with chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  Structure is angular or subangular blocky. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Schlomer soils occur on terraces at elevations of 750 to 1,000 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  They formed in loess mixed with alluvium in the A and Bw horizon and in residuum and alluvium derived from the Ringold Formation in the Bk horizon.  These soils overlay soft siltstone and shale sediments of the Ringold Formation. These soils are in an arid climate that borders on xeric with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches.  The frost free season is 180 to 200 days."
