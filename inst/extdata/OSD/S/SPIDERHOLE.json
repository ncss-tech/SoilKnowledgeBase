  "OVERVIEW": "The Spiderhole series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in loess derived from mixed rocks over residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuff or basalt.  Spiderhole soils are on plateaus and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
