Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,405 to 1,904 meters.  The climate is arid with cool winters; summers are hot and dry with occasional convection storms.  The mean annual precipitation is 130 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C, the frost-free season is 120 to 170 days."
