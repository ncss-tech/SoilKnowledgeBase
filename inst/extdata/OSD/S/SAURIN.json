The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is about 12 to 15 degrees F. The soil is dry throughout from mid-June until sometime in October and is moist the rest of the time. It is moderately acid or slightly acid. Organic matter is more than 1 percent but only to depths of less than 20 inches. Base saturation ranges from 60 to 90 percent but is more than 75 percent in all parts to a depth of at least 30 inches. Gravel ranges from 5 to 15 percent throughout the profile. Clay is 27 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3 or 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.\nThe B horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 5/2 or 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/2 or 3/3. It has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure, has a slight increase in clay over the A horizon and contains a few clay films."
