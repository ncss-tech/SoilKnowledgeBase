  "OVERVIEW": "The Saurin series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone and shale. Saurin soils are on hills and have slopes of 2 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 61 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is about 12 to 15 degrees F. The soil is dry throughout from mid-June until sometime in October and is moist the rest of the time. It is moderately acid or slightly acid. Organic matter is more than 1 percent but only to depths of less than 20 inches. Base saturation ranges from 60 to 90 percent but is more than 75 percent in all parts to a depth of at least 30 inches. Gravel ranges from 5 to 15 percent throughout the profile. Clay is 27 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3 or 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.\nThe B horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 5/2 or 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/2 or 3/3. It has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure, has a slight increase in clay over the A horizon and contains a few clay films."
