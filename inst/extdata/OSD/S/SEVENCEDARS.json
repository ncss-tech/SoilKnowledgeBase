  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are usually moist, and are dry in the soil moisture control section less than 45 consecutive days after the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 40 to 45 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is less than 46 degrees F. The particle-size control section has 35 to 80 percent rock fragments. It has a phosphate retention of greater than 85 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 2.0 to 4.0 percent, 2.0 to 15 cmol (+)/kg of KCl extractable aluminum, and 20 to 30 percent 15-bar moisture (air dried sample). Moist bulk density is 0.75 to 0.90g/cubic centimeter in the particle-size control section. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches or more thick. Hue is 7.5YR or 10YR. Soil reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry. It is typically medial loam but may range to medial clay loam. It has 15 to 35 percent gravel, 5 to 35 percent cobbles, 0 to 10 percent stones and 0 to 10 percent paragravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 8 dry. The fine-earth section of the upper part is typically medial loam or medial sandy loam but may range to medial clay loam; the lower part is loam or sandy loam. It has 10 to 25 percent clay.  It has 15 to 35 percent gravel, 5 to 35 percent cobbles, 0 to 10 percent stones and 0 to 10 percent paragravel."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sevencedars soils occur in the area along the summit of the Coast Range; some of the area has been glaciated. The soils are on ridgetops and side slopes of mountains. Slopes are 5 to 100 percent. The soils are typically formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt and coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock but in some areas may be mixed with glacial till from volcanic rock. Elevation is 2,800 to 4,100 feet. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 120 to 150 inches. The mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F. The frost free period is 40 to 100 days."

Caterl, Laderly, and Murtip soils are on side slopes which are lower in elevation and have frigid soil temperature regimes. Newanna soils are on side slopes and are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock. Woodspoint soils have a medial family particle-size class and a cryic soil temperature regime."
