  "REVDATE": "03/2008",
  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sitdown series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial outwash and ablation till with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  These soils are on backslopes and footslopes of mountains, outwash terraces and terrace escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between a depth of 12 and 35 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The volcanic ash mantle is 10 to 14 inches thick and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 1.00 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 65 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist, 3 to 6 dry.  It is 10 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, and 0 to 15 percent stones.  It is gravelly ashy loam, gravelly ashy sandy loam or stony ashy sandy loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly or extremely gravelly loamy sand, very cobbly loamy sand, very gravelly sand or very cobbly sand with 20 to 65 percent gravel, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 20 percent stones.  It is slightly acid or neutral."

Manley, Resner, and Togo soils have a volcanic ash mantle greater than 14 inches thick. In addition, Manley and Togo soils are loamy-skeletal in the lower part of the control section. Manley soils are on the upper slopes of foothills and mountains.  Togo series are on backslopes, footslopes and ridges of mountains.  Nevine, Oxerine, Parmenter, Sacheen, and Torboy soils have a frigid temperature regime.  Nevine soils are on moraines, foothills and mountains.  Oxerine soils are on footslopes, backslopes, shoulders and ridges of hills and mountains.  Parmenter soils are on kames, kame terraces and outwash terraces.  Resner, Torboy and Sacheen soils are on similar landscapes as Sitdown soils.    Moses soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact and are on toeslopes, footslopes, backslopes and broad ridges of mountains."

Further investigation is needed as to a udic soil moisture regime.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Sandy-skeletal, isotic Andic Eutrocryepts to Sandy-skeletal, isotic Haploxerandic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
