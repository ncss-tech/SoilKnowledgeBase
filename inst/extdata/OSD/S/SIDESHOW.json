  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sideshow series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from shale.  Sideshow soils are on hills, alluvial fans, and terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
