  "OVERVIEW": "The Sieben series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from metamorphic and igneous rock.  They are on dissected alluvial fans, fan remnants, stream terraces, hills and mountains.  Slopes are 1 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
