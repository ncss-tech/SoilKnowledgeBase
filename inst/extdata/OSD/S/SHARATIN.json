  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Total thickness of recent volcanic ash ranges from a few inches to 15 inches, but the normal range in thickness is 7 to 12 inches.  Texture of the uppermost layer ranges from silt loam to loamy fine sand.  Thickness of the buried dark solum ranges from 10 to 25 inches; normally the solum is 15 to 20 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sharatin soils are on glacial outwash terraces in narrow valleys.  The soils are formed in volcanic ash deposited over the outwash sand and gravel.  The climate is cool maritime.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 70 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.  Temperatures below freezing are recorded on fewer than 40 days annually, and temperatures above 70 degrees F. are rare."
