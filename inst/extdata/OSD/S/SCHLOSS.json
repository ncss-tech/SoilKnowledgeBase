Rock fragments of mostly channer or flag-size sandstone make up 15 to 35 percent of the A and E horizons, 20 to 55 percent of the B horizon, and 35 to 70 percent of the C horizon.  The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The A and E horizons are loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.  Some pedons do not have a C horizon."
