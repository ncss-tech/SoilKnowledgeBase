  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments of mostly channer or flag-size sandstone make up 15 to 35 percent of the A and E horizons, 20 to 55 percent of the B horizon, and 35 to 70 percent of the C horizon.  The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The A and E horizons are loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.  Some pedons do not have a C horizon."

    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils have previously been included in the Lehew series.  The major diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are the alluvial E horizon from 2 to 4 inches and the cambic horizon from 12 to 20 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Mineralogy and particle size data from the site location are available from the NSSL and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.\nNote: CEC class based on similar soils.\nThe 1/2006 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). The CEC activity class placement is based on similar soils and not on laboratory data. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available.\nCompeting series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nPrevious revision dates: 2/85\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
