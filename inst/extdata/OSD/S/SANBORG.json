    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F.  The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 60 percent and the weighted average content of fine sand or coarser is less than 15 percent.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 2 percent throughout.  Discontinuous disoriented remnant varves, inherited from the original lacustrine parent material, occur in individual subhorizons in some pedons.  Redox accumulations occur in the glossic horizon and, in some pedons, in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Saturation occurs in these horizons for 1 month or more per year in most years.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam.  Reaction naturally ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSanborg soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizon or both).  The E part has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  The E part is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4. It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value of 3 to 5.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value of 3 or 4.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a C horizon with color, texture, and reaction similar to the BC horizon described above."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Kent, Negwegon, and Nester series.  (These series will be classified to Glossic Oxyaquic) A similar soil is the Amnicon(T) series.  Kent and Nester soils have 15 percent or more of fine sand or coarser in the particle-size control section.  Negwegon soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section and have mean annual soil temperature of 45 to 47 degrees F.  Amnicon soils are in the very fine family."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Sanborg soils are on knolls and flats on till plains.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent.  These soils formed in clayey till derived from clayey lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 43 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 90 to 120 days.  Elevation ranges from 600 to 1000 feet."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Badriver, Kellogg, and Odanah soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Badriver soils and the well drained Odanah soils form a drainage sequence with Sanborg soils. The moderately well drained Kellogg soils are nearby in landscape positions similar to those of Sanborg soils where there is a sandy outwash mantle 20 to 40 inches thick over the clayey till."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Surface runoff is low or medium.  Permeability is slow.  Sanborg soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 1.0 to 2.5 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period of September to June in 6 or more out of 10 years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for woodland.  Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest.  Common trees are red maple, balsam fir, white spruce, white pine, quaking aspen, and paper birch.  Common understory species are American hazel, redosier dogwood, black snakeroot, big leaf aster, wild sarsaparilla, and bracken fern.  Some areas are used for cropland and pastureland.  Oats, bromegrass, timothy, alfalfa, trefoil, and red clover are the principle crops.  Many areas which were formerly cropland are now idle and are reverting to natural vegetation."
