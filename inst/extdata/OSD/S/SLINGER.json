  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Fractured sandstone occurs at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  The ochric epipedon ranges from 4 to inches thick.  Rock fragments range from 45 to 70 percent in the particle-size control section and commonly are angular pebbles and less commonly cobbles.  The mean annual soil temperature is 39 to 42 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F.  These soils are dry in all parts 50 to 55 percent of the time that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 through 6 dry and 6 through 8 moist.  Gravel ranges from 15 to 30 percent.  The A horizon is strongly calcareous or very strongly calcareous.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 4 through 8 dry and 6 through 8 moist.  It commonly is very gravelly loam and less commonly gravelly loam or very cobbly loam.  Rock fragments range from 30 to 65 percent, with 20 to 50 percent as pebbles and 0 to 45 percent as cobbles.  The C horizon is moderately calcareous or strongly calcareous."
