  "OVERVIEW": "The Sumerduck series consists of very deep, moderately well to somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium and slope alluvium from schist, phyllite, metamonzonite and gneiss in the Northern Piedmont. Permeability is moderately slow. Slope ranges from 0 to 7 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 41 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.",

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Cotaco, Delanco, Dillard, Russett, and Sheva soils are in the same family. Cotaco soils formed in colluvium and alluvium of acid sandstone, siltstone, and shale on footslopes, fans, and low stream terraces. Delanco soils formed in alluvium of micaceous crystalline rock on terraces, heads of drainageways, and footslopes. Dillard soils formed on toeslopes and stream terraces. Russett soils formed in sandy and loamy deltaic and fluvio-marine sediments of the coastal plain. Sheva soils are moderately deep to soft bedrock and formed in residuum of Triassic-aged sedimentary rock."

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F, mean annual precipitation ranges from 387 to 44 inches, frost free days range from 165 to 203 days, and elevation ranges from 100 feet to 400 feet above sea level."

The typical pedon originally had a Oi layer described as undecomposed leaf material or similar undecomposed material."
