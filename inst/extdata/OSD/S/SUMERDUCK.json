  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Cotaco, Delanco, Dillard, Russett, and Sheva soils are in the same family. Cotaco soils formed in colluvium and alluvium of acid sandstone, siltstone, and shale on footslopes, fans, and low stream terraces. Delanco soils formed in alluvium of micaceous crystalline rock on terraces, heads of drainageways, and footslopes. Dillard soils formed on toeslopes and stream terraces. Russett soils formed in sandy and loamy deltaic and fluvio-marine sediments of the coastal plain. Sheva soils are moderately deep to soft bedrock and formed in residuum of Triassic-aged sedimentary rock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sumerduck soils formed in alluvium and slope alluvium from schist, phyllite, metamonzonite and gneiss in the Northern Piedmont. Sumerduck soils are in drainageways that are subject to frequent, extremely brief, flash flooding events with little or no deposition or erosion. Slope gradients range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F, mean annual precipitation ranges from 387 to 44 inches, frost free days range from 165 to 203 days, and elevation ranges from 100 feet to 400 feet above sea level."

The well drained Penhook and Yellowbottom (tentative) soils are on summits, shoulders and backslopes of sidelopes on adjacent ridges. The moderately well drained Goldvein soils are on summits and shoulders of sideslopes and headslopes. The well drained Brinklow soils are on steeper backslopes of side slopes."
