  "OVERVIEW": "The Sylvania series consists of deep, moderately well drained, soils formed in colluvium and the underlying residuum weathered from shale or interbedded shale and sandstone.  These soils are on ridgetops and sideslopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 39 inches.",
