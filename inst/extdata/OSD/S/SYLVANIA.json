  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on upland ridgetops and sideslopes.  The regolith consists of a mantle of colluvium and the underlying residuum weathered from shale or shale and interbedded sandstone.  Sandstone fragments and, in areas where conglomerate is present chert fragments, are commonly part of the colluvium.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 44 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 63 degrees F."

Barco soils have a loamy subsoil, are moderately deep to bedrock and are on similar landscape positions.  Barden soils are very deep, and are commonly on less sloping positions.  Collinsville soils are shallow to bedrock and are on lower side slopes below Sylvania soils."
