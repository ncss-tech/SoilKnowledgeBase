The soils formed from medium and moderately coarse textured alluvium weathered from mixed acid igneous and basaltic rocks.  In some areas, the upper part of the profile contains an admixture of loess.  Elevations are about 2,500 to 5,500 feet.  The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 100 to 150 days."
