  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stampede soils are on fan remnants and lava plateaus.  These soils formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from volcanic rock such as tuff or from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 1 to 20 percent.  Elevations range from 1,220 to 2,130 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."
