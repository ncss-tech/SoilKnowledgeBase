  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 32 to 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid except the A and B1 horizons are less acid in recently limed areas.  Gravel and cobbles range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in the solum.  Coarse fragments in the C horizon average from 0 to 35 percent by volume, but some subhorizons within the C horizon may contain as much as 50 percent of coarse fragments by volume.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 and chroma of 2 to 4.   It is loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 and chroma of 3 or 4; hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6; hue of 5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4.  It is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8; hue of 5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4 or 6. Mottles in shades of brown range from none to common in the upper part and mottles in shades of brown, yellow, gray, and red range from none to common in the lower part.  It is loam, clay loam, or silt loam.  Some pedons have a silty clay loam texture, however, the weighted average clay content of the upper 20 inches averages between 18 and 30 percent, and the content of sand coarser than very fine sand is more than 15 percent.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Mottles in shades of brown, gray, yellow, or red range from none to common.  It is loam, clay loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Mottles range from none to many in shades of brown, gray, and yellow.  The fine earth texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam and contains thin strata of loamy sandy."

Chavies and Hayter soils have base saturation more than 35 percent and soil temperature less than 59 degrees F.  Humphreys soils have more than 15 percent chert fragments. State soils have an Ap horizon with moist color value of 4 or more and have mixed mineralogy.  Statler soils have mixed mineralogy.
