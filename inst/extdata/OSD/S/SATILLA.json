  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The surface mineral horizons range from 21 to 38 inches thick.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid throughout.  Soil salinity ranges from none to low.\nThe Ap or the surface A horizon has hue of 10YR, values of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 2.  Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Organic matter content ranges from 20 to 35 percent.\nThe A1 horizon has hues of 5Y to 10YR, values of 3 to 5, and chroma of 0 to 2.  None to common fine or medium brown mottles are throughout the horizon.  The A2 horizon has hues of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The A1 and A2 horizons are clay loam, silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  Organic matter content ranges from 5 to 25 percent.\nThe 2Oa has hues of 10YR to 5YR, values of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The organic material has weak, medium granular or weak medium blocky structure.  Stumps, logs and roots range from few to many."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family.  Series in similar families are the Chowan and Wysocking series.  Chowan soils have less than 15 percent of the control section as coarse or coarser than fine sand.  Wysocking soils have 80 to 95 percent silt plus very fine sand and less than 18 percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Satilla soils are on broad, nearly level river flood plains.  They are farther inland than the tidal marshes but are still influenced by tides.  Tide water of low salinity covers the soils during storm tides.  These soils formed in loamy marine and fluvial sediments deposited over organic material.  Elevation ranges from 5 to 10 feet above mean sea level.  Mean annual precipitation is about 45 to 55 inches and is evenly distributed throughout the year.  Mean annual temperature is 65 to 70 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bayboro, Bohicket, Capers and Ellabelle series.  All of these soils lack buried organic horizons.  In addition, Bayboro, Capers and Ellabelle soils contain more clay in the control section and lack stratified layers of organic material.  Bohicket and Capers soils have high salinity and Bohicket soils are continuously saturated with sea water."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Satilla soils are very poorly drained.  Runoff is very slow, and permeability is moderately rapid.  The water table is at depths of 0 to 1.5 feet in undiked areas.  In diked areas it is at a depth of 0 to 1.5 feet in late winter and early spring but recedes to about 1.5 to 3.0 feet in summer and fall."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the soil was diked and used for rice culture before 1900.  It is now used mainly for growing vegetables and pasture grasses.  Natural vegetation consists of giant cutgrass, big cordgrass, maidencane, rush and cattails in the diked areas.  Natural vegetation in undiked areas consists of water tupelo, water oak, blackgum and southern baldcypress."
