  "OVERVIEW": "The Stringam series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and in eolian material derived dominantly from rhyolitic tuff and obsidian.  Stringam soils are on nearly level to steep uplands and mountain slopes.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
