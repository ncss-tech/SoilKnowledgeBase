  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. JLL/GRB",
  "REVDATE": "09/2006",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Santa Isabel series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils on coastal plains.  They formed in clayey alluvium that weathered from volcanic rocks and limestone.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",
