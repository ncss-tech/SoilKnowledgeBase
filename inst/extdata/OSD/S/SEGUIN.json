  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Average texture of the 10- to 40-inch control section is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Silicate clay ranges from 18 to 30 percent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 40 to 60 percent.\nThe A horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2; 2.5Y 4/2), dark brown (10YR 4/3), grayish brown (10YR 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2), or brown (10YR 5/3).\nThe Bw horizon is grayish brown (10YR 5/2), brown (10YR 5/3), or pale brown (10YR 6/3).\nThe C horizon is light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), pale brown (10YR 6/3), or very pale brown (10YR 7/3, 7/4).  The texture of individual stratum in the C horizon varies from loamy very fine sand to silty clay and a few strata have up to 15 percent limestone pebbles.  Some pedons have buried A horizons 5 to 10 inches thick."

All these soils have less than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the control section.  In addition, Bergstrom, Bosque, Frio, and Gowen soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick; Grigston soils have mean annual soil temperatures less than 59 degrees F.; Laredo soils have mean annual soil temperature more than 72 degrees F.; and Spur and Toyah soils have fine-loamy control sections."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Flooding occurs at intervals of about once each year to once every 5 years in areas not protected by dams.  Slope gradients are mainly less than 1 percent but range up to 3 percent.  The climate is dry subhumid with a mean average rainfall of 28 to 35 inches.  The Thornthwaite P-E indices are 38 to 48.  Mean average temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F."
