  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Hantho series. Closely related is the Corwith series. Other related series are the Nichols, Salter, and Yahara. Hantho soils have hue yellower than 10YR in the lower part of the series control section. Corwith soils have a mesic temperature regime. Nichols and Salter soils formed in similar deposits but do not have mollic epipedons and mottles with chroma of 2 or less. In addition, Salter soils are coarse-loamy. Yahara soils formed in similar materials but are coarse-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 635 to 889 mm (25 to 35 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 8.9 (46 to 48 degrees F)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Nichols, Rousseau, Shawano, and Keowns soils. The moderately well drained and well drained Nichols soils form a drainage sequence with the Shiocton soils. Rousseau and Shawano soils are in similar landscape positions, but formed in fine sand. In some places near the 8.3 degrees C (47 degree F) temperature line, the poorly drained mesic Keowns soils are associated with the Shiocton soils."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate. These soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of 31 to 76 cm (1 to 2.5 feet) for some time in most years."

Specialty crops, such as beans, cabbage, peas, and sweet corn, are also commonly grown. Some areas are used for pastureland. Native vegetation is prairie grasses and scattered wetland tree species."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 inches) (Ap); cambic horizon - 25 to 66 cm (10 to 26 inches) (Bw1, Bw2); Aquic feature  redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less and saturation within 76 cm (30 inches) of the surface.\nAdditional field and lab study is needed to verify placement in coarse-silty family and presence or absence of an argillic horizon.\nAbout 70% of the correlated acres of Shiocton are in the mesic soil temperature zone including the series type location in southern Shawano County. I was going to change the classification from frigid to mesic but there is an existing series (Corwith) which competes and which I could not adequately differentiate from Shiocton. If the classification of Shiocton remains the same after further study, perhaps the Corwith series could be used for the mesic acres. Another possibility is to correlate the mesic acres as slightly warmer temperature taxadjuncts of Shiocton as was done in the Calumet-Manitowoc soil survey. Also, if Shiocton remains frigid, a new typical pedon should be used since the current one is in the mesic zone just south of the mesic/frigid line in Shawano County.\nSome of the acres in Shawano County and all of the 9280 acres correlated in Oconto County are in the frigid temperature zone.\nA new series is needed for the 2900 acres correlated as a clayey substratum phase in Outagamie County\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
