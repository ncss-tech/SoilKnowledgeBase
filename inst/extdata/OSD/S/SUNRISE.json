  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil between the depths of 8 and 15 inches is moist in all parts from late November until March. Mean annual soil temperature is about 64 degrees F. Organic matter is less than 1 percent. Some pedons are saline with conductivity of the saturation extract ranging up to 16 mmhos/cm.\nThe A horizon is loam, fine sand, sandy loam, loam or light sandy clay loam. It is brown, pale brown, or light yellowish brown (lOYR 5/3, 6/3, 6/4). Disseminated lime may occur throughout the A horizon or start in the lower part.\nThe C horizon is light yellowish brown, pale brown, or very pale brown (lOYR 6/4, 6/3, 7/3, 7/4), or light brownish gray, light gray, or white (2.5Y 6/2, 7/2, 8/2). It is clay loam or sandy clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay between 10 and 40 inches. It is heavy sandy loam in the lower part in some pedons. Extremely hard 2mm to 2 inches lime nodules make up 35 to 80 percent by volume, 10 to 40 inch control section. The sum of the carbonates is greater than 65 percent with calcium carbonate greater than 40 percent by weight. Some pedons have an unrelated faintly mottled stratified horizon at depths greater than 60 inches."

The climate is aridic with hot, dry summers and mild, somewhat moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 3 to 8 inches, some as snow.  Average January air temperature is 44 degrees to 45 degrees F.; average July air temperature is 80 degrees to 88 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 61 degrees to 65 degrees F. The frost-free season is 200 to 300 days. The Thornthwaite PE index is less than 12."
