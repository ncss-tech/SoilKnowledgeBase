  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other soil series in the same family. The Croghan, Elmwood, Finch, Naumburg, Scarboro, and Swanton soils are in related families. The Croghan, Finch, Naumburg, and Scarboro soils do not have the strongly contrasting clayey layer in the substratum. In addition,  Finch soils have ortsein layers that are greater than 50 percent in extent over each pedon, and Scarboro soils have histic epipedons. Elmwood and Swanton soils do not have spodic horizons and are in coarse-loamy over clayey textural families."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stockholm soils are on low-lying, nearly level landscapes. They are in deltas or other similar sandy outwash sediments over marine deposits. The overlying sandy deposits are from predominately noncalcareous sandstones or from granitic rocks. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The climate is humid continental. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 42 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F. The growing season ranges from 120 to 150 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  The Stockholm soils are in a drainage sequence with the moderately well drained Flackville soils. Other associated soils are the Adams, Adjidaumo, Croghan, Deford, Eelweir, Elmwood, Heuvelton, Munuscong, Muskellunge, Naumburg and Scarboro soils.  The Adjidaumo, Deford, Eelweir, Muskellunge, and Naumburg and Swanton soils occupy similar topographic positions as Stockholm soils. Adjidaumo, Eelweir and Muskellunge soils formed completely in clayey marine sediments. Deford and Naumburg soils formed in very deep sandy materials and do not have the closely underlying clayey substratum. Swanton soils are coarse-loamy over clayey.  Adams, Croghan, Elmwood, and Heuvelton soils are better drained and are on higher and generally more convex landscape positions. In addition, Adams and Croghan formed in very deep sandy material and do not have the closely underlying clayey substratum, Elmwood soils are coarse-loamy over clayey, Heuvelton soils formed in clayey lacustrine sediments and do not have overlying sandy materials.  Munuscong and Scarboro soils are very poorly drained and are on lower concave landscapes.  In addition, Munuscong soils are coarse-loamy over clayey, and Scarboro soils formed in very deep sands and do not have the contrasting clayey substratum."

Permeability is moderately rapid in the sandy materials and very slow in the clayey materials.  These soils have a perched seasonal high water table at depths of 0 to 12 inches below the soil surface."
