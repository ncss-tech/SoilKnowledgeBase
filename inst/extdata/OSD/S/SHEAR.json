  "OVERVIEW": "The Shear series consists of deep, well drained, soils that were formed in eolian clays.  These soils are on nearly level to sloping wind deposited dunes.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 51 to 54 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 69 inches to 72 inches F. These soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section 75 to 85 percent of the time the soil temperature is about 41 degrees F.\nSalinity and alkali affect ranges from moderate to strong and the calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 40 percent. The organic matter remains above 35 percent to a depth of 50 inches. The 10 to 40 inch control section averages 40 to 60 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of l0YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2. The very fine granular structure gives the appearance and loose consistence of medium sand. This horizon is dominantly silty clay, but ranges to sandy clay loam. It is strongly or very strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 dry above 40 inches and 6 or 7 dry below 40 inches, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silty clay or silty clay loam. The C horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline. In some pedons distinct or prominent mottles occur below 50 inches. In some pedons, the C horizon contains salt and/or gypsum flecks that range from few to many."
