The mollic epipedon is 24 to 40 inches thick.  The solum is slightly to strongly effervescent throughout.  The particle-size congtrol section has a weighted average clay content of 18 to 27 percent.  Depth to the water table is 1.0 to 1.5 feet from March to April.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is slightly to very strongly alkaline.  SAR is 13 to 30.\nThe Bkn horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam, loam, or sandy loam.  It is moderately to very strongly alkaline.  SAR is 25 to 70.  It has 15 to 30 percent clay.\nThe 2Bk horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is moderately to very strongly alkaline.  SAR is 13 to 30.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.
