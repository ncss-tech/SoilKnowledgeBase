Bertolotti, Cliffdell, Goode, Mesachie, Pitcher, and Roxer soils are very deep. Littlejohn soils are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days and contain angular andesite rock fragments. Mountaineer soils have an umbric epipedon. Pheeney soils have an umbric epipedon and contain angular andesite rock fragments. Scotties soils are deep (100 to 150 cm) to a lithic contact and contain angular sandstone rock fragments. Umpa soils have 10 to 20 percent clay in the particle-size control section, formed in pyroclastic material, and contain less than 5 percent volcanic glass."

They formed in volcanic ash overlying glacial drift and colluvium.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 500 to 1,800 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 8 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 75 to 110 days."
