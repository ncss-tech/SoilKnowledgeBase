  "OVERVIEW": "The Sawtooth series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash overlying glacial drift and colluvium.  Sawtooth soils are found on slopes of 0 to 60 percent on debris aprons, bedrock benches and valley walls of glaciated mountain landscapes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
