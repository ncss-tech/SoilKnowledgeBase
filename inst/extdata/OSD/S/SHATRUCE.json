  "OVERVIEW": "The Shatruce series consists of soils that are well drained, slowly permeable, and moderately deep to claystone bedrock. These soils formed in residuum from claystone and colluvium and occur on backslopes of ridges. Slope is dominantly about 35 percent, but ranges from 8 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).",
