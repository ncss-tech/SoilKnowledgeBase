Classification was changed 6/90 from Ultic subgroup to Typic based on base saturation data collected from 13 pedons in Palo Pinto and Jack Counties, Texas.\nEdited 12/2013 (RFG-SCP): Changed to tabular format and included metric values. Updated the competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 36 cm (0 to 14 in)(A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 36 to 66 cm (14 to 26 in)(Bt horizons)\nPaleustalfs feature: abrupt texture change at 36 cm (14 inches)\nDensic Material: 86 to 203 cm (34 to 80 inches)(Cd horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA: None\nTaxomomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
