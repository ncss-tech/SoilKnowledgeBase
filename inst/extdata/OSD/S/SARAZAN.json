  "OVERVIEW": "The Sarazan series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium basaltic breccia with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  Sarazan soils are on mountain slopes and broad ridgetops at elevations of 1,600 to 2,800 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 90 inches and average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Rock fragments are usually subangular basaltic breccia pebbles and cobbles that have strong brown to yellowish red weathering rinds, but are black in the unweathered centers.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 55 percent in the particle-size control section.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR; value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR or 2.5YR; value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry; and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is ashy silt loam or ashy silty clay loam.  Pebbles range from 35 to 50 percent and cobbles from 5 to 10 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 2.5YR; value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry;  and chroma of 4 to 8 moist and dry.

Pheeney soils have a lithic contact with andesite at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Voight soils have an argillic horizon.  Xeno soils formed in highly weathered tuff or tuffaceous breccia, have a paralithic contact with tuff, and have soft tuff fragments in the particle-size control section."
