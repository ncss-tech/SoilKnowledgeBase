    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Average annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F.  Depth to a lithic contact is 40 to 60 inches.  Rock fragments are usually subangular basaltic breccia pebbles and cobbles that have strong brown to yellowish red weathering rinds, but are black in the unweathered centers.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 55 percent in the particle-size control section.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR; value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR or 2.5YR; value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry; and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is ashy silt loam or ashy silty clay loam.  Pebbles range from 35 to 50 percent and cobbles from 5 to 10 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 2.5YR; value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry;  and chroma of 4 to 8 moist and dry.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is ashy silt loam or ashy silty clay loam.  Pebbles range from 45 to 55 percent and cobbles from 5 to 30 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sarazan soils are on mountain slopes and broad ridgetops at elevations of 1,600 to 2,800 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from basaltic breccia and volcanic ash and loess.  The climate is marine and characterized by cool, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 80 to 100 inches. The average annual air temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 140 to 190 days."

All of these soils except Hoffstadt have an umbric epipedon.  Beigle, Jonas, Voight, and Xeno soils have less than 35 percent hard rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Pheeney soils have a lithic contact with andesite at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Voight soils have an argillic horizon.  Xeno soils formed in highly weathered tuff or tuffaceous breccia, have a paralithic contact with tuff, and have soft tuff fragments in the particle-size control section."
