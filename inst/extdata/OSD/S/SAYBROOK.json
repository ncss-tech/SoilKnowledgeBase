Saybrook soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy till of Wisconsinan age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F)., mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 1016 mm (29 to 40 inches), frost free days range from 150 to 190 days, and elevation ranges from 180 to 311 meters (590 to 1020 feet) above mean sea level."

Catlin soils are on similar nearby landforms where the loess mantle is thicker. The Lisbon soils are the somewhat poorly drained member of a drainage sequence with Saybrook soils. The Brenton, Drummer, and Flanagan soils all are on nearly level or gently sloping parts of the landscape and have lower chroma in the upper part of the B horizon. La Rose soils typically have steeper slopes, a higher content of sand in the solum, and carbonates within a depth of 61 cm (24 inches)."

A perched seasonal high water table is at a depth of 61 to 107 cm (2.0 to 3.5 feet) at some time between February and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the solum and moderately slow (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow in the substratum."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Previously correlated Saybrook soils that developed in silt loam glacial till in eastern Illinois are part of the glacial moraine in which the Graymont series has been established. MLRA 108 update activities should determine the feasibility of recorrelating \"silt loam/silty clay loam till Saybrook to the Graymont series. The differentiating criteria would be greater than or less than about 50 percent silt in the glacial till.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nmollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 38 cm (15 inches). (Ap and AB horizons);\nargillic horizon - the zone from 38 to 91 cm (15 to 36 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and 2Bt5 horizons);\nlithologic discontinuity - at a depth of 81 cm (32 inches) (contact between the Bt4 and 2Bt5 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
