    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 46 to 100 cm. Depth to bedrock is commonly more than 183 cm. Rock fragments, mainly gravel and cobbles, range from 0 to 5 percent above 100 cm and from 0 to 60 percent below 100 cm. Stones cover 0 to 3 percent of the surface in some areas.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is commonly silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam. Structure is granular or subangular blocky with very friable or friable consistence. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe B horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Distinct or prominent redoximorphic features are present. Textures include silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, clay loam, and very fine sandy loam. Structure is commonly subangular blocky with friable consistence. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nBC horizons, where present, are similar in color and textures to B horizons. Fine sandy loam may be present at depth. Structure is commonly weak subangular blocky with friable consistence. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4. Textures include silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, clay loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam. Sandy loam and loamy sand may be found below the control section. Structure is commonly massive with friable consistence. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2C horizons (which, if present, occur below the particle size control section) have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4. Textures include sandy loam, loamy sand, with pockets or thin lenses of silt loam. Structure is massive or massive with plate-like divisions. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Siwanoy soils are nearly level to gently sloping soils found in depressional areas and drainageways in till plains. These soils formed in acid slope wash derived from glacial till, aeolian, or glaciolacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1021 to 1325 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 17 degrees C."

The well drained Charlton, the moderately well drained Sutton, and the poorly drained Leicester soils, associated in a drainage sequence, are formed in similar materials. Chatfield and Hollis soils have bedrock at 50 to 100 and 25 to 50 cm depths, respectively. The well drained Paxton, moderately well drained Woodbridge, poorly drained Ridgebury, and the very poorly drained Whitman soils, associated in a drainage sequence, are formed in similar materials but all have a dense substratum."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Siwanoy soils are mapped in the initial survey areas of Bronx County, NY. The soils are of minimal extent (less than 200 acres), however they are of unique importance to users of the soil surveys.\nSiwanoy soils often exhibit an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth however this is a result of anthropogenic filling (deposition) not alluvial deposition; excluding them from the concept of Fluvaquentic Humaquepts. Proposed revisions to soil taxonomy in ICOMANTH Circular Letter 7 developed for anthropogenic soils will help to clarify this difference.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Umbric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 22 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).\n2. Cambic horizon  - the zone from 22 to 80 cm.\n3. Aquic conditions - the zone from 22 to 69 cm (Bg1 and Bg2 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
