  "OVERVIEW": "The Schnipps series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from basalt or tuff.  Schnipps soils are on hills.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
