  "BYREV": "TDT-SWA-ERS",
  "REVDATE": "4/98",
  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sheddenbrook series consist of moderately well drained soils that are moderately deep to sandstone. They formed in a mantle of glacial outwash sands over bedrock. They are nearly level and gently sloping soils on outwash plains and near-shore deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 34 inches.",

Redoximorphic features consisting of concentrations of iron/manganese oxides, or iron depletions occur within 30 inches of the mineral soil surface. Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume. Unless limed, reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout.\nSome pedons have a thin Oe or Oi horizon.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loamy sand in the fine earth fraction.\nSome pedons have an E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak subangular blocky or it is single grain. Consistence is very friable or loose.\nThe Bs horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 through 5. Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand and sand in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable, very friable or loose.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Faint to prominent redoximorphic concentrations or depletions are commonly present. Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate platy, or it is single grain or massive."

The Nemadji series do not have bedrock within 40 inches.\nThe Adams, Covert, Covertfalls, Croswell, Deerton, Duel, East Lake, Fahey, Gratten, Ishpeming, Karlin, Kiva, Manitowish, Missisquoi, Occur, Pence, Rousseau, Rubicon, Sayner, and Vilas series are in related families. The Adams, Covert, Croswell, East Lake, Gratten, Karlin, Kiva, Manitowish, Mississquoi, Pence, Rousseau, Rubicon, Sayner and Vilas soils have bedrock at depths greater than 60 inches. Gratten and Covert soils have a mesic temperature regime as well. Covertfalls and Occur soils have sandy over loamy materials. In addition, Covertfalls soils have a mesic temperature regime. Deerton and Ishpeming soils lack redoximorphic features throughout and are somewhat excessively drained. Fahey soils average more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. The Duel soils are less acid, less gravelly, and overlie limestone bedrock."

They are on outwash plains and near-shore deposits of lake plains. The parent material is mainly from sandstone, but includes some igneous and metamorphic rocks. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 36 inches; mean annual temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period ranges from 90 to 140 days. Elevation ranges from 200 to 800 feet above sea level."
