  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil typically is calcareous throughout but depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 7 inches and is always shallower than one-half the thickness of the mollic epipedon.  Continuous subhorizons of genetically concentrated visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate do not occur within the control section, although some visible accumulation may occur discontinuously at any depth or throughout the control section.  The particle-size control section is loam or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume and are dominantly less than three inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is mildly alkaline through strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

The soils formed in alluvial material derived from a variety of rock sources.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 12 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  The mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature is 62 degrees F."
