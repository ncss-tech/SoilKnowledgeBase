It is loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or fine sand.\nThe IIC horizon is brown (10YR 5/3; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4), dark brown\n(10YR 4/3; 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4), pale brown (10YR 6/3), very pale brown (10YR 7/3, 7/4), light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), or light brown (7.5YR 6/4).  It is loamy fine sand or fine sand that may contain alternating strata of fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy\nclay loam that are slightly darker and are presumed to contain\nmore organic matter.  Clay content of the 10- to 40-inch control section is dominantly 2 to 10 percent.  Some pedons contain up to\n15 percent by volume of waterworn pebbles and cobbles."

Bruno and Kiomatia soils are moist for longer periods of time in the\nmoisture control section.  Corlena soils have mean annual soil temperatures less than 59 degrees F.  Gracemore soils have a water table at depths of less than 40 inches most of the year.  Lincoln\nand Orif soils are calcareous in the 10- to 40-inch control\nsection.  In addition, Orif soils contain more than 35 percent\ncoarse fragments and more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Pulaski soils\nhave average textures finer than loamy fine sand in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Zalla soils have mean annual soil temperatures more than 72 degrees F. and are calcareous."

Slope gradients are mostly less than 1 percent but range up to 3 percent.  The climate is subhumid with an average annual precipitation of 25 to 40 inches.
