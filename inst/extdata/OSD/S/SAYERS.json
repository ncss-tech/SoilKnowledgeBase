  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are medium acid through\nmildly alkaline in all horizons.\nThe A horizon is brown (10YR 5/3; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4), dark brown\n(10YR 4/3), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), pale brown (10YR 6/3), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), or\nlight brown (7.5YR 6/4).  It is loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or fine sand.\nThe IIC horizon is brown (10YR 5/3; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4), dark brown\n(10YR 4/3; 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4), pale brown (10YR 6/3), very pale brown (10YR 7/3, 7/4), light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), or light brown (7.5YR 6/4).  It is loamy fine sand or fine sand that may contain alternating strata of fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy\nclay loam that are slightly darker and are presumed to contain\nmore organic matter.  Clay content of the 10- to 40-inch control section is dominantly 2 to 10 percent.  Some pedons contain up to\n15 percent by volume of waterworn pebbles and cobbles."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bruno, Corlena, Gracemore,\nKiomatia, Lincoln, Orif, Pulaski, and Zalla series.  Bruno and Kiomatia soils are moist for longer periods of time in the\nmoisture control section.  Corlena soils have mean annual soil temperatures less than 59 degrees F.  Gracemore soils have a water table at depths of less than 40 inches most of the year.  Lincoln\nand Orif soils are calcareous in the 10- to 40-inch control\nsection.  In addition, Orif soils contain more than 35 percent\ncoarse fragments and more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Pulaski soils\nhave average textures finer than loamy fine sand in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Zalla soils have mean annual soil temperatures more than 72 degrees F. and are calcareous."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sayers soils are in nearly level to gently undulating flood plains along streams and rivers.  The soil formed\nin alluvium.  Slope gradients are mostly less than 1 percent but range up to 3 percent.  The climate is subhumid with an average annual precipitation of 25 to 40 inches.  The mean annual\ntemperature is 60 degrees to 70 degrees F.  The Thornthwaite P-E indices are 38 to 60."

Tabor soils are upland soils with clayey Bt horizons.  Uhland soils occur in\nsimilar positions but have coarse-loamy 10- to 40-inch control sections."
