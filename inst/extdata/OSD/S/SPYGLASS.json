    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Spyglass soils are on floodplain steps of basin floors . They formed in eolian, alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from sandstone, shale, and gypsum. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,200 to 6,900 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."
