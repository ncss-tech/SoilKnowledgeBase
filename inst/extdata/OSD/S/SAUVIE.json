  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are saturated with water from about December through June and are subject to freshwater overflow during high tides unless diked and artificially drained. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 53 degrees to 55 degrees F. Soil depth is over 5 feet, but rooting depth may be limited to less than 30 inches by a seasonal watertable. The 10- to 40-inch control section averages 25 to 35 percent clay. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 24 inches thick and has distinct mottles in the lower part.\nThe A horizon is usually silty clay loam and ranges to silt loam. It has strong to moderate subangular or angular blocky structure. A thin overwash of sand or fine sand less than 4 inches thick overlies the A horizon in some areas.\nThe B horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist. It has mottles that are distinct in the upper part and distinct to prominent in the lower part.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam. In some pedons this horizon has thin lenses of peaty material or loamy material with moist value of 2 or 3 and moist chroma of 1 in 10YR hue.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or neutral, value of 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 0 through 2. It is composed of stratified material ranging from sandy loam to silt loam. Mottles are distinct with some areas having dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) \"pipestems\" up to 1/4 inch in diameter formed in tubular pores and channels. Thin layers of gray (10YR 6/1) ashlike material are in some pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Beaucoup, Blackoar, Bridgeson, Gorham, Lummi, and Wapato series. Beaucoup and Gorham soils lack influence of ash and are moist in the summer. Also, Beaucoup soils have solum thickness of 40 to 60 inches. Blackoar and Lummi soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the 10- to 40-inch section. Also, Lummi soils are affected by tidal salt water. Bridgeson soils are neutral, have chroma of 1 in the A horizon, and are moderately fine textured in the lower Cg horizon. Wapato soils are fine textured in the lower part of the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Sauvie soils are on flood plains along the lower Columbia River and its tributaries. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in recent alluvium with some mixing with volcanic ash.  They are at elevations of 10 to 40 feet in a climate with cool dry summers and cool moist winters. Annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches. Average July temperature is 66 degrees to 68 degrees F., average January temperature is 38 degrees to 40 degrees F., and average annual temperature is 52 degrees to 54 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 165 to 210 days."
