  "OVERVIEW": "The Steinbeck series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from soft sand-stone. Steinbeck soils are on smooth rolling hills and have slopes of 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

The soil is moist in some or all parts between the depths of 7 to 20 inches from October to August. It is dry in all parts for less than 45 consecutive days in August and September. Moisture in the summer is due, in part, from heavy fog and low evapotranspiration rates.\nThe A1 horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/3, 7/2, 7/3 or 7/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2 or 5/3. It is loam or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is medium acid or slightly acid. Base saturation is less than 50 percent.\nThe A2 horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/3, 7/2, 7/3 or 7/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2 or 5.3. It is loam or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is medium acid or slightly acid. Base saturation is less than 50 percent.\nThe B2t horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6 or 6/8 and moist color of 10YR 4/4, 5/4, 6/4 or 6/8. There are common distinct and prominent 5YR 5/8; 7.5YR 5/8; 10YR 4/2, 3/6, 5/6 or 6/8 moist mottles.  This horizon is clay loam or heavy loam and averages 25 to 35 percent clay.
