  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of solum ranges from 100 to 163 centimeters.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 1.2 to 2.4 meters.  Depth to bedrock is more than 1 meters.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 38 to 60 centimeters.  The control section has more than 40 percent sand and less than 40 percent silt in the fine earth.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 30 percent above the fragipan including up to 15 percent greater than 7.5 centimers in diameter and 10 to 50 percent in the fragipan and C horizons including up to 5 percent greater than 7.5 centimeters in diameter.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral if limed in the A horizon, strongly acid to medium acid in the B2 and A`2 and medium acid to mildy alkaline beneath.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture ranges from fine sandy loam to silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 through 6.  Texture is commonly fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine earth fraction and less commonly sandy loam.  It is massive or has weak granular or blocky structure, and friable or very friable consistence.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture ranges from sandy loam to loam in the fine earth fraction.  It is massive or has weak platy structure and friable or firm consistence.  The horizon may be mottled.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is commonly very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam and less commonly sandy loam.  Structure is very coarse prismatic with prisms ranging in size from 15 to 60 centimeters across.  It is firm to very firm and brittle.  Material like that of the E horizon extends downward between prisms.\nThe C horizon is similar to the Bx horizon in color and texture but is massive or platy."

Bath, Lackawanna, Mardin, and Wellsboro soils commonly have 55 percent or more silt plus very fine sand in particle size control section.  Bernardston, Broadbrook, Newport, Paxton, Pittstown, Scituate, and Woodbridge have Cx horizons. In addition Bernardston has greater than 50 percent silt and very fine sand, Broadbook has greater than 50 percent silt, Newport is strongly acid to medium acid in the Cx and has 2.5Y or yellower hues in the B and Cx;  Pittstown, Scituate and Woodbridge are mottled in the B2 and Scituate has loamy fine sand or coarser texture in the Cx.  Braceville, Ira, Mardin, Wellsboro and Wurtsboro soils have distinct or prominent mottles below depths of 30 to 75 centimeters.  Broadalbin soils have silt loam to fine sandy loam control sections with more than 40 percent silt.  Ludlow, Montauk, and Wethersfield soils have fragipans that have weak platy structure or are massive.  Nantucket and Swartswood soils are extremely acid to strongly acid throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sodus soils are on drumlins and other convex landforms of glacial till plains.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 45 percent.  The soils developed in firm basal till dominated by red and gray sandstone with variable components of limestone, shale, and some erratic crystalline igneous material.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 80 to 113 centimeters; mean annual air temperature, from 7 to 9 degrees C.; mean growing season, from 120 to 180 days."

Amboy soils and associates occupy associated corase silty lake sediments; Alton or Howard soils are on associated glacial outwash terraces; and Colonie soils are associated on sandy deltas."
