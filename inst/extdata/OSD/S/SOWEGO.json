  "OVERVIEW": "The Sowego series consists of deep, moderately well drained to well drained soils formed in colluvium and local alluvium over residuum of shale, siltstone, fine-grained sandstone and conglomerate on footslopes, fans, saddles and along drainageways in the Triassic-Jurassic Basin of the Northern Piedmont. Permeability is moderate to moderately rapid. Slope ranges from 0 to 7 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 41 inches and mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",

Athol soils contain rock fragments of sandstone and do not have mottles in the upper 40 inches. Bolton, Bookwood and Duffield soils have chert and limestone rock fragments. Brecknock, Carpenter, Door, Dormont, Frondorf, Morrison, Ryder, Washington, Westmoreland, Wheeling and Williamsburg soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the Bt2 horizon. Carpenter soils are also well drained. Culleoka, Loudonville and Penn soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches. Hayter soils are well drained and have moderately rapid permeability. Lamotte soils contain sandstone fragments in the lower part of the solum in the Cr horizon. Legore, Myersville and Neshaminy soils have igneous rock fragments. Mechanicsburg soils have a lithologic discontinuity within 40 inches."

Drainageways are subject to frequent, extremely brief, flash flooding events with little or no deposition or erosion. Slope gradients range from 0 to 7 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 53 degrees to 57 degrees F, mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 44 inches, frost free days range from 165 to 203 days, and elevation ranges from 150 feet to 550 feet above mean sea level."

Nestoria soils are shallow, loamy-skeletal soils on backslopes. Bermudian soils are on floodplains. Clover soils are fine and very deep on summits and backslopes. Panorama soils are fine-loamy and deep on summits and backslopes. Ashburn soils are moderately well drained with a thin fluvial capping."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was previously mapped as Manassas.  Data showed series to be deep to paralithic contact, versus very deep, primarily due to its close proximity to Penn and Nestoria soils.\n02/2005 added statement about frequent, extremely brief, flash flooding in the geographic setting.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon-zone from 0 to 9 inches (Ap horizon)\n2. Argillic horizon-zone from 9 to 23 inches (Bt horizon)\n3. Aquic conditions-zone from 23 to greater than 60 inches\n4. Base saturation between 35 and 60 percent at 42 inches\n2016 Update was to change the status to Established."
