The sandstone is typically fractured in the upper part and most strata are cemented, however, some strata are noncemented. Some fragments of the sandstone harden irreversibly when exposed, and are deposited as stones and boulders on lower slopes as erosion undercuts them.\nExcavation difficulty: moderate to high.\nEffervescence: very slight to strong\nReaction: moderately alkaline."
