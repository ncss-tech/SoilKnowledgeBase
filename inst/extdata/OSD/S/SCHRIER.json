  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to basalt (lithic) or partially decomposed shale (paralithic) is 40 to more than 60 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F. Schrier soils are usually moist but are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days at depths of 4 to 12 inches in most years during the four-month period following the summer solstice. Depth to soft segregated lime is 10 to 43 inches. The particle-size control section is silt loam or loam in the upper part and loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam in the lower part; it averages 20 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 50 percent coarser than very fine sand. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick. The solum is 20 to 45 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist, 1 to 3 dry to a depth of 20 inches or more; below 20 inches the value ranges to as high as 4 moist and 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3. It has 0 to 5 percent gravel.\nThe 2Bk horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. Rock fragments range from 0 to 55 percent of which 0 to 45 percent are gravel and 0 to 10 percent are cobbles. Horizons containing over 35 percent rock fragments are less than 6 inches thick and occur as a discontinuity below the loess mantle. It has 5 to 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 4 to 6 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is loam or clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay. Rock fragments range from 0 to 80 percent of which 0 to 70 percent are gravel and 0 to 25 percent are cobbles. Horizons containing over 35 percent rock fragments occur below a depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Schrier soils are on foot slopes and side slopes of structural benches, canyons and hills.   Elevations are 1,500 to 4,500 feet. Slopes are 2 to 90 percent. These soils formed in colluvium weathered from basalt and shale and from reworked loess. The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F. The mean July temperature is about 67 degrees F., and the mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 160 days."

Cupper soils contain more than 60 percent volcanic ash. Ritter soils have less than 18 percent clay and are noncalcareous. Tub soils have an argillic horizon and are clayey."
