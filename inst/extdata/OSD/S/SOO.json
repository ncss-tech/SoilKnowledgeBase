  "OVERVIEW": "The Soo series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in loamy lacustrine deposits on lake plains.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Some areas have an A horizon with similar colors.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam. Reaction of the Ap is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 3 or 4.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizons have hue of 5YR or 7,5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is predominantly silty clay loam with thin bands of silt loam, silt, and silty clay. Reaction is moderately alkaline."
