The particle size control section averages from 18 to 40 percent clay and less than 50 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some areas have an A horizon with similar colors.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam. Reaction of the Ap is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 3 or 4.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizons have hue of 5YR or 7,5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is predominantly silty clay loam with thin bands of silt loam, silt, and silty clay. Reaction is moderately alkaline."

The Brickton and Pickford soils contain more than 40 percent clay in the control section.  In addition, the Brickton soils have grayer colors and have argillic horizons.  The Bruce soils contain more than 50 percent fine or coarser sand in the particle size control section and have darker surfaces."
