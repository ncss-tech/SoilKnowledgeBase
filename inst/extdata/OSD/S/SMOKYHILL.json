  "OVERVIEW": "The Smokyhill series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils on high flood plains.  They formed in clayey over lighter colored silty alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 74 centimeters (29 inches).  Mean annual air temperature is 13 degrees C. (55 degrees F.) at the type location.",
