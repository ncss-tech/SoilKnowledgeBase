  "OVERVIEW": "The Springlake series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in sandy and gravelly deposits on outwash plains, ground moraines, kame moraines, stream terraces and beach ridges. Permeability is very rapid. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 740 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

Calcium carbonate content ranges from 10 to 25 percent. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent by volume in the upper part of the solum and from 5 to 35 percent in the lower part of the solum and the substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is sand, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sand, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand. Reaction is strongly acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bhs horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loamy sand, sand or loamy coarse sand. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand or the gravelly analogs of these textures. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2BC horizon has colors and textures similar to those of the 2C horizon. Some pedons have a thin beta B horizon (less than 1/10 the thickness of the overlying horizons) at the contact of the carbonates.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sand, coarse sand or the gravelly analogs of these textures."

All of these soils, except for Furlong, have less than 15 percent calcium carbonate within the series control section. In addition, the Deerton and Furlong soils have a lithic contact at 50 to 100 centimeters. Kalkaska, Liminga, and Omega soils have less that 10 percent gravel in the series control section. Pence soils have more than 15 percent combined content of silt and clay in the upper 51 centimeters of the profile. The Adams and Duxbury soils have isotic mineralogy."
