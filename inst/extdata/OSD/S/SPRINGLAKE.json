  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 38 to 102 centimeters and corresponds to the depth of free carbonates. Calcium carbonate content ranges from 10 to 25 percent. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent by volume in the upper part of the solum and from 5 to 35 percent in the lower part of the solum and the substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is sand, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sand, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand. Reaction is strongly acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bhs horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loamy sand, sand or loamy coarse sand. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand or the gravelly analogs of these textures. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2BC horizon has colors and textures similar to those of the 2C horizon. Some pedons have a thin beta B horizon (less than 1/10 the thickness of the overlying horizons) at the contact of the carbonates.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sand, coarse sand or the gravelly analogs of these textures."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Deerton, Furlong, Kalkaska, Liminga, Omega, and Pence series and the closely related Adams and Duxbury series. All of these soils, except for Furlong, have less than 15 percent calcium carbonate within the series control section. In addition, the Deerton and Furlong soils have a lithic contact at 50 to 100 centimeters. Kalkaska, Liminga, and Omega soils have less that 10 percent gravel in the series control section. Pence soils have more than 15 percent combined content of silt and clay in the upper 51 centimeters of the profile. The Adams and Duxbury soils have isotic mineralogy."

The Greylock soils are finer textured throughout the profile. Guardlake soils are sandy-skeletal. Kalkaska soils do not have gravelly substratums. Longrie soils are underlain by limestone bedrock. Rubicon soils do not have the darker colored upper subsoil and gravelly substratum."
