  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to chalk ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 40 to 65 percent.  Non-carbonatic clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline in the surface layer, and from slightly to moderately alkaline in the rest of the profile.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Some pedons have cobbly or very cobbly silt loam or silty clay loam surface layers with 7 to 74 percent by volume of cobbles 3 to 10 inches in size and 4 to 15 percent by volume of chalk fragments or calcium carbonate nodules smaller than 3 inches.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay with up to 10 percent by volume of chalk fragments. Soft masses and/or concretions and nodules of calcium carbonate range from few to many.\nThe Bw horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. Iron accumulations in shades of yellow and brown range from none to common. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe upper part of the Bk horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Iron accumulations in shades of yellow and brown range from none to common. Soft masses and concretions of calcium carbonate range from few to many. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay with 0 to 15 percent by volume of chalk fragments.\nThe lower part of the Bk horizon and the BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown and gray range from few to many. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay or their channery analogues with 2 to 25 percent by volume of chalk fragments and/or calcium carbonate nodules.\nThe BC or C horizon, where present, has the same range of colors and textures as the lower Bk horizon. Thin laminations of soft chalk may be present in some pedons.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of level-bedded chalk or soft limestone with platy rock structure. It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools, and is rippable by mechanized equipment."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sumter soils are on sloping topography in the Blackland Prairie, but slopes range to steep at its contact with the Southern Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 1 to 40 percent. They formed in marly clays and chalk.  The climate is humid subtropical.  Near the type location, the average annual temperature is about 67 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is about 51 inches."

The well drained Binnsville, Demopolis, and Watsonia soils have sola less than 20 inches thick to chalk.  Brooksville, Houston and Okolona series have less than 40 percent calcium carbonate in the profile. In addition, the very poorly drained Brooksville series is on lower positions and is very deep. The moderately well drained Houston soils are on less sloping areas and have more clay in the control section. The well drained Okolona soils are on less sloping areas, are very deep and have intersecting slickensides in the solum. Kipling, Oktibbeha, and Vaiden soils have acid subsoils, are very deep and have more clay in the control section. In addition, the somewhat poorly drained Kipling soils are on similar positions, the moderately well drained and poorly drained Oktibbeha and Vaiden soils are on less sloping areas. The well drained Maytag soils are on less sloping areas, have vertic properties and more clay in the subsoil."
