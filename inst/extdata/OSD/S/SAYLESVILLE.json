  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Saylesville soils are on glacial lake basins, stream terraces, and in slack water areas associated with ground moraines.  Slopes  typically are 2 to 6 percent but range from 0 to 40 percent.  These soils formed primarily in silty clay loam lacustrine deposits with a thin silty or loamy mantle. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 635 to 889 mm (25 to 35 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 7.8 to 11.7 degrees C (46 to 53 degrees F)."

Del Rey, Martinton, Mundelein, and Wauconda soils are on lower positions on the landscape and have some grayer colors and are somewhat poorly drained.  In addition, Martinton and Mundelein soils have mollic epipedons and Wauconda soils have darker colored surface horizons.  Zurich soils are on similar landscapes.  Jericho soils have darker colored surface horizons.  Montgomery and Pella soils are in depressional areas, are poorly drained, and have mollic epipedons."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The previous series concept allowed for moderately well drained soils.\nThese areas will need to be evaluated during MLRA update activities.\n06/2006\n? Layer depths in the typical pedon for the OSD do not entirely match those in the TUD for Washington County. Don?t know if a different pedon was described or if the Tud was redescribed. Both are in the same quarter section. Also, the TUD\nsays 2-6 percent slope and the OSD says 5 percent slope but the location given in the OSD is in an A slope map unit. Slope of OSD was changed to 1 percent.\n- A new series (Oxyaquic Hapludalf?) is needed for moderately well drained acres mapped in several survey areas. This includes all the acres correlated in Jefferson Co., WI and in Lake Co., IL. It also includes at least some of the acres correlated in Green and Walworth Co., WI and probably includes some of the acres correlated in Kenosha-Racine, Milwaukee-Waukesha, Ozaukee, Sheboygan, and Washington Co., WI.\n- 639 acres were correlated as Saylesville Dark Surface Variant (Typic Argiudoll) in Kenosha-Racine County survey.\n- Colors with chroma of 2 are allowed in the range of characteristics for the Bt because they occur in the Bt3 horizon of the typical pedon. Need to field check to verify if 2 chroma colors really occur in this well drained soil.\n- If the Ap and E horizons (0-12?) are a silty mantle (loess or alluvium) over the clayey lacustrine deposits, there should be a lithologic discontinuity and the Bt, BC and C horizons should be 2Bt, 2BC, and 2C.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon -\n0 to 31 cm (0 to 12 inches) (Ap, E);  albic horizon - 23 to 31 cm (9 to 12 inches) (E); argillic horizon - 31 to 74 cm (12 to 29 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
