  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sieberell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans and sidslopes of hills.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
