  "OVERVIEW": "The Specie series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from sandstone.  Specie soils are on mesa slopes, terraces, and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 5 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Elevation is 7,000 to 9,000 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches and is evenly distributed throughout the year, but with a slight maximum during late summer. Over 50 percent of the precipitation falls as snow.  Mean annual temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F.  The frost free period is 70 to 90 days."

The 4 to 17-inch horizon was judged to be a cambic horizon because of the blocky structure and apparent loss of carbonates.\nThe superactive CEC activity class is presumed for this series based on the general trend indicated by lab data throughout this region.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
