Elevation is 7,000 to 9,000 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches and is evenly distributed throughout the year, but with a slight maximum during late summer. Over 50 percent of the precipitation falls as snow.  Mean annual temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F.  The frost free period is 70 to 90 days."

Principal native vegetation is Rocky Mountain Douglas fir and scattered ponderosa pine with an understory of slender wheatgrass, elk sedge, boxleaf myrtle, and Oregon grape.  Some areas have shrub and grass vegetation consisting of antelope bitterbrush, true mountainmahogany, mountain big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, prairie junegrass, and bluebunch wheatgrass."

The 4 to 17-inch horizon was judged to be a cambic horizon because of the blocky structure and apparent loss of carbonates.\nThe superactive CEC activity class is presumed for this series based on the general trend indicated by lab data throughout this region.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
