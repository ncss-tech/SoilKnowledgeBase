  "OVERVIEW": "The Sader series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine materials derived from mixed rocks.  Sader soils are on lake terraces and lake plains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 225 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
