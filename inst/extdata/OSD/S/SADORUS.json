  "OVERVIEW": "The Sadorus series consists of shallow, well drained soils on mountain sides, foothills, and nearly level terraces.  They formed in loess and residuum weathered from rhyolite.  Permeability is  moderately rapid.  Slopes are 1 to 60 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

The average annual precipitation is 17 to 22 inches.  The average annual temperature is 37 to 40 degrees F. The frost-free season is 70 to 90 days.  Moisture consists of 2 to 4 feet of snow, late winter and early spring rains and brief summer storms."
