  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in loess and eolian material from mixed sources and weathered rhyolite.  Slopes are 1 to 60 percent. Elevations are 5100 to 6,300 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 17 to 22 inches.  The average annual temperature is 37 to 40 degrees F. The frost-free season is 70 to 90 days.  Moisture consists of 2 to 4 feet of snow, late winter and early spring rains and brief summer storms."
