    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 through 55 inches. Depth to carbonates ranges from 17 through 55 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Content of rock fragments range from 0 through 3 percent in the mineral soil above a depth of 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR; value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate granular or fine blocky. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through neutral.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through neutral.\nThe Bt/E horizon has colors and textures similar to the Bt and E horizon. Structure is moderate or strong, fine to coarse subangular or angular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through neutral.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 10R through 5YR; value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. Some pedons have subhorizons with redoximorphic concentrations having chroma 3 through 8 and hue of 10R through 7.5YR. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is heavy silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. The clay percentage averages greater than 35 percent. Structure is moderate or strong, subangular or angular blocky, or coarse or very coarse prismatic. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with colors and textures similar to the Bt. Consistence is firm or very firm. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10R through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silty clay or clay. Consistence is firm or very firm. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alexandria, Brushcreek, Lairdsville, Lucas, Morley, Ozaukee, and St. Clair series in the same family. Lairdsville soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. The remaining soils have 7.5YR or yellower hues throughout the Bt horizon.\nThe Cayuga, Cazenovia, Hudson, Milton, and Odessa series are similar soils in related families. Cayuga soils have a lithologic discontinuity below which is an increase in rock fragment content. Cazenovia soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section. Hudson soils have 7.5YR to 2.5Y hues throughout the B horizon. Milton soils have mixed mineralogy. Odessa soils have dominant chroma of 2 or less on faces of peds in the Bt horizon."

Slope ranges from 0 through 60 percent. The soils formed in reddish clayey lake sediment. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 through 40 inches; mean annual air temperature, from 45 through 50 degrees F.; mean annual frost free days range from 120 through 180 days."

    "content": "REMARKS: Schoharie soils were formerly classified as Typic Hapludalfs. They have been classified as Oxyaquic Hapludalfs due to changes in the 8th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon:\n1) Ochric Epipedon - from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon).\n2) Glossic feature - from 11 to 18 inches (Bt/E horizon).\n3) Argillic Horizon - from 11 to 33 inches (Bt/E, and Bt horizons).\n4) Oxyaquic Subgroup - as evidenced by redoximorphic accumulation of iron above 40 inches (Bt and C horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
