  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Steinmetz series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granodiorite and other granitic rock types.  Steinmetz soils are on hill slopes and side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 90 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to partially decomposed granodiorite is more than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 10 to 18 percent clay, 0 to 30 percent gravel, and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. Colors which qualify for mollic only occur in the upper 3 to 5 inches.  It has 0 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.  It has 2 to 4 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  It is a sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nA BC or C horizon may occur in some pedons.  Textures vary from sandy loam to very gravelly sand.  These horizons commonly occur directly above weathered granodiorite."

The Chaix, Elwha, Siskiyou and Sitkum soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact.  Dome soils are dry for over 90 consecutive days.  Gilligan soils have a silt loam mantle which extends into the particle-size control section and overlay glacial outwash material.  Siskiyou and Tethrick soils are dry for 60 to 90 consecutive days.  Ulricher soils are dry for 90 to 120 consecutive days.  Vader soils developed from fine grained sandstone and contain 0 to 30 percent soft gravel and cobble-size fragments."

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granodiorite or other granitic rock types.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 40 to 60 inches but may range to 100 inches in high winter rainfall interior mountains of Curry County, Oregon.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 160 days. Slopes range from 35 to 75 percent."
