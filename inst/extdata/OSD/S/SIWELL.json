  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 24 to 55 inches in thickness.  Thickness of the silty upper part is 20 to 40 inches.  The A, E, and Bt horizons range from very strongly acid to medium acid.  The 2Bt horizon ranges from very strongly acid to moderately alkaline.  The 2C horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10 YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe E horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chorma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam.\nThe Bt subhorizons have hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8, or they have hue of 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 6; and some part of the upper 10 inches of the Bt horizon has a matrix with value of 5 or 6.  In some pedons the lower part of the Bt horizon has few to common mottles in shades of brown, gray, or red.  The Bt horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam, and the upper 20 inches has from 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon commonly is mottled in shades of brown, red, or gray.  Less commonly it has a matrix in hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 mottles are few to many in shades of gray and brown.  The 2Bt horizon is silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe 2C horizon has the same range in color as the 2B horizon.  Soft accumulations or nodules of calcium carbonate, if present, are few to many."

Dubbs, Gallion, Memphis, Rilla, and Vian soils do not have clayey  horizons.  Falkner and Tippah soils have a acid clayey 2Bt horizon.  Freestone soils have a fine-loamy particle size class.  Loring and Providence soils have a fragipan.  Muskogee soils have mottles with chroma of 2 or less in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Siwell soils are on uplands of the Southern Mississippi Valley Silty Uplands Major Land Resource Area.  These are nearly level to moderately steep soils.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soil formed in a silty mantle, 20 to 40 inches thick, and the underlying calcareous clays.  The climate is warm and humid.  The mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees Fahrenheit and the mean annual precipitation is about 51 inches near the type location."
