  "REVDATE": "04/2003",
  "STATES": "MS",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Siwell series consists of moderately well drained soils that formed in a silty mantle, about 20 to 40 inches thick, and the underlying calcareous clay.  Permeability is very slow.  These nearly level to moderately steep soils are in uplands of the Southern Mississippi Valley Silty Uplands Major Land Resource Area.  Water is perched above the clayey layer at a depth of 2.5 to 3 feet during winter and early in spring.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 24 to 55 inches in thickness.  Thickness of the silty upper part is 20 to 40 inches.  The A, E, and Bt horizons range from very strongly acid to medium acid.  The 2Bt horizon ranges from very strongly acid to moderately alkaline.  The 2C horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10 YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe E horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chorma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam.\nThe Bt subhorizons have hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8, or they have hue of 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 6; and some part of the upper 10 inches of the Bt horizon has a matrix with value of 5 or 6.  In some pedons the lower part of the Bt horizon has few to common mottles in shades of brown, gray, or red.  The Bt horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam, and the upper 20 inches has from 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon commonly is mottled in shades of brown, red, or gray.  Less commonly it has a matrix in hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 mottles are few to many in shades of gray and brown.  The 2Bt horizon is silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe 2C horizon has the same range in color as the 2B horizon.  Soft accumulations or nodules of calcium carbonate, if present, are few to many."
