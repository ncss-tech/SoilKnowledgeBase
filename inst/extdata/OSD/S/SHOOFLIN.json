    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shooflin soils are on terraces and foothills in intermountain valleys.  Elevations are 3,500 to 4,500 feet.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in material derived from Tertiary sediment.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters and moist springs.  Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches, much of which falls as snow and as spring rain.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."
