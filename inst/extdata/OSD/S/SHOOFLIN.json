  "OVERVIEW": "The Shooflin series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from Tertiary sediment.  These soils are on terraces and foothills in intermountain valleys.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
