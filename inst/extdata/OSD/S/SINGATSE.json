  "OVERVIEW": "The Singatse series consist of very shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived mainly from volcanic rocks. Singatse soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Berzatic, Blacktop, Cadrina, Pintwater, Sojur, and Tsaya series.\nBerzatic soils have 15 to 35 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the particle-size control section.  Blacktop soils are intermittently moist in the upper part of the moisture control section for about 10 days cumulative in the period June through September by convection storms.  Cadrina soils have fragments of sandstone or shale in the particle-size control section and are intermittently moist in the moisture control section during summer months. Pintwater soils have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates.  Sojur soils have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are dominated by channers.  Tsaya soils have hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR and are dominated by channers of sedimentary rock."
