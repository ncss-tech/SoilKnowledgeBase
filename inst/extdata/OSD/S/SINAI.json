  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free calcium carbonate ranges from about 17 to 35 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 25 inches.  Tonguing of A horizon material occurs below the Ap or A horizon above depths of 35 inches.  The tongues of soil material extend into the C horizons in some pedons.  The particle size control section contains 45 to 60 percent clay.  When the soil is dry, cracks 1/8 inch to 2 inches wide and several feet long extend downward through the solum.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is silty clay, but is silty clay loam or clay in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bss horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silty clay or clay. Some pedons have mottles inherent to the parent material. Intersecting slickensides are few to common. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bkss and C horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist and chroma of 1 to 6.  It is silty clay or clay.  Intersecting slickensides are few to common.  The C horizon in most pedons is stratified with layers of silty clay, silty clay loam, clay loam, and silt loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Most pedons have mottles inherent to the parent material in the Bk and C horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sinai soils are nearly level to moderately sloping on uplands having plane and convex surfaces.  Slope gradients typically are less than 6 percent, but range from 0 to 9 percent.  They are mostly circular in shape, are typically surrounded by shallow depressions or moats, and are in high parts of the landscape.  The soils formed in clayey glaciolacustrine sediments of ice-walled lakes. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 27 inches.  Growing season is about 125 to 130 days; average growing season precipitation from 13 to 22 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 3000."

Nutley soils are on similar landscapes and have a mollic epipedon less than 16 inches thick.  Sinai soils are on slightly higher positions in the landscape than the Barnes, Forman, Kranzburg, Poinsett, and Peever soils.  Buse soils are on plane to convex slopes below the Sinai soils.  The Barnes, Buse, and Forman soils contain less than 35 percent clay in the control section.  The Kranzburg, Poinsett, and Peever soils have a mollic epipedon less than 16 inches thick.  In addition, the Kranzburg and Poinsett soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section.  The Peever soils have an argillic horizon.  Tonka soils have an albic horizon and are in depressions."
