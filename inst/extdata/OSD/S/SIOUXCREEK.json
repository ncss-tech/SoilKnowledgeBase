  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the loamy mantle and depth to sandy residuum, ranges from 20 to 39 inches.  Depth to a paralithic contact with sandstone ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Except for thin (less than 5 inch) transition horizons above the sandy 2B horizon, the coarse-loamy mantle has less than 50 percent fine or coarser sand and averages 7 to 17 percent clay. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the loamy mantle.  Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy residuum. Typically reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout the pedon but it ranges to neutral in the upper part of the solum, where the soil is limed.  Redox accumulations are typically throughout the soil below the A or Ap horizon.  Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are within the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon or higher. Saturation occurs in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon at some time in most years.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  The E horizon is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nSiouxcreek soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.  Some pedons with a B/E horizon do not have a Bt horizon.\nThe 2BC or 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or fine sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed dominantly in silty or loamy alluvium or in silty or loamy alluvium and till over sandy residuum from the underlying weakly cemented sandstone.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 120 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 800 to 1950 feet."

The well drained Hayriver soils are on adjacent side slopes at lower elevations where geologic erosion has removed the loamy glacial deposits and the soil is formed in loamy residuum from sandstone."

These soils have an perched seasonal water table at a depth of 1 to 2.5 feet at some time during the period from September to June in most years."
