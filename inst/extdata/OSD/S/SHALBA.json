  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to paralithic contact ranges from 12 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture of the A horizon is fine sandy loam.  The reaction ranges from slightly acid through very strongly acid.  The boundary between the A and Bt horizons is abrupt and wavy.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Ped coatings of very dark gray, dark gray, and very dark grayish brown range from none to common.  Mottles are in ped interiors and range from none to common, fine to medium in shades of brown and yellow. Structure ranges from weak to moderate, medium angular blocky.  Reaction of the Bt ranges from medium acid to very strongly acid. The lower boundary of the Bt is wavy or irregular.\nThe Cr horizon is a clayey tuff, tuffaceous sandstone, siltstone, or tuffaceous clay.  Texture ranges from sandy loam to clay loam. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through mildly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the family.  Similar soils are the Arol, Burlewash, Corrigan, and Falba.  All of these have a solum thickness greater than 20 inches.  In addition, Arol soils are less acid in the Bt horizon and  Burlewash soils are well drained.  Corrigan soils are in areas of higher rainfall."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shalba soils are on nearly level to sloping convex uplands.  Slopes are mainly 1 to 5 percent but range from 1 to 8 percent.  These soils developed from interbedded clays, tuffs, ash beds, sandstones, and siltstones of the Catahoula and related formations.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 67 to 70 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 44 inches.  Frost free days range from 260 to 280 days and elevation ranges from 250 to 600 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 44 to 64."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils do not have an aquic moisture regime.  Classification change from Typic Albaqualfs is the result of interpretation that low chroma matrix is due to litochromic influences.  Field observation, landscape position and climate indicate the whole soil is not typically saturated throughout.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 4 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - 4 to 18 inches (Bt horizon)\nAbrupt textural change - at 4 inches; paralithic contact - at 18 inches.\nParalithic contact at 18 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
