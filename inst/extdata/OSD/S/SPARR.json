    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 60 or more inches.  Soil reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid throughout, except where the surface has been limed.  Some pedons have up to 2 percent cobble or stone-size chert fragments at the soil surface or within the solum.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have mixed horizons and are multicolored in shades of gray and brown.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Where chroma of 1 or 2 is in the upper part, it is due to clean sand grains and not to wetness.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, or yellow and below 18 inches, gray, range from none to common.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe EB horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Redoximorphic depletions in shades of gray range from few to many.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nSome pedons have a BE horizon.  Where present, it has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, and gray range from few to many.  Texture ranges from loamy sand to fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, gray, and red range from few to many.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 7.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, brown, and red range from few to many.  Texture ranges from sandy loam to sandy clay.\nThe BCg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 7.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, brown, or red range from few to many.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has the same range of colors as the Btg horizon.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand."

Apopka and Arredondo soils are well drained and are on higher positions.  In addition, Arredondo soils have a higher activity class.  Masaryk and Millopper soils are moderately well drained and are on higher positions.  In addition, Millhopper soils have a higher activity class."

The very poorly drained Blichton soils are on lower positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick.  The poorly drained Kanapaha soils are on lower positions.  Jumper and Lochloosa soils are on similar positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick.  In addition, Jumper soils have more than 5 percent plinthite in the subsoil.  The well drained Kendrick soils are on higher positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick."
