  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sparr series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly to slowly permeable soils on uplands of the coastal plain.  They formed in thick beds of sandy and loamy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.",

Some pedons have up to 2 percent cobble or stone-size chert fragments at the soil surface or within the solum.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have mixed horizons and are multicolored in shades of gray and brown.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Where chroma of 1 or 2 is in the upper part, it is due to clean sand grains and not to wetness.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, or yellow and below 18 inches, gray, range from none to common.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe EB horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Redoximorphic depletions in shades of gray range from few to many.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nSome pedons have a BE horizon.  Where present, it has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, and gray range from few to many.  Texture ranges from loamy sand to fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, gray, and red range from few to many.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 7.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, brown, and red range from few to many.
