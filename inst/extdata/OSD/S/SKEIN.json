  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Skein soils are on mesa tops, ridges, structural benches and high terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 65 percent.  The soil formed in colluvial remnants, slope alluvium or residuum derived dominantly from interbedded sandstone and shale.  Skein soils are in a climatic setting that receives the annual precipitation in an evenly distributed pattern throughout the year with over 50 percent received as snow.  Elevations range from 6,200 to 8,200 feet.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches.  Precipitation Pattern:  Wettest months are July to October and driest months are December and June.  Mean annual temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 85 to 120 days."
