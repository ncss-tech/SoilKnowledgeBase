  "OVERVIEW": "The Sutherland series consists of very shallow and shallow to a hardpan, well drained soils that formed in fan alluvium from mixed sources.  Sutherland soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.",

Ferrogold, Orrubo, Wechech, and Wodovar soils are in the Mohave Desert receive mostly winter precipitation and are usually dry from April through November.  Neso soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 59 to 62 degrees F. In addition, Neso soils are in the Pecos-Canadian Plains and Valleys and are more moist in May and June. Orrubo soils have Cr horizons below the hardpan at depths between 17 and 30 inches. Tencee soils are drier in the control section for longer periods (typic/aridic). Philder soils have more than 18 percent clay in the upper part of the B horizon.  Infantry, Paisano, and Sequite soils are inactive."
