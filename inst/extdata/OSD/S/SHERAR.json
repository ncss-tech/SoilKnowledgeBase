  "OVERVIEW": "The Sherar series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and clayey sediments over very cobbly breccia.  These soils are on uplands and have gently sloping to very steep south-facing slopes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 54 degrees F.  The solum ranges from 20 to 30 inches thick.  Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam or clay loam with 5 to 10 percent pebbles and 10 to 25 percent cobbles.  This horizon has moderate thin platy to weak very fine granular structure.\nThe B horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay or gravelly clay and has 40 to 50 percent clay, 5 to 25 percent pebbles and 10 to 25 percent cobbles.  This horizon has weak medium or coarse prismatic and moderate to strong medium to coarse subangular blocky structure in the upper part and weak to moderate subangular blocky structure in the lower part."
