    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for at least half the time (cumulative) during the period the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. and are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for more than 90 consecutive days during the four months following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 54 degrees F.  The solum ranges from 20 to 30 inches thick.  Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam or clay loam with 5 to 10 percent pebbles and 10 to 25 percent cobbles.  This horizon has moderate thin platy to weak very fine granular structure.\nThe B horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay or gravelly clay and has 40 to 50 percent clay, 5 to 25 percent pebbles and 10 to 25 percent cobbles.  This horizon has weak medium or coarse prismatic and moderate to strong medium to coarse subangular blocky structure in the upper part and weak to moderate subangular blocky structure in the lower part."
