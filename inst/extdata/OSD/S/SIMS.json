The somewhat poorly drained Kawkawlin soils have an argillic horizon and are in slightly higher landscape positions. The moderately well drained Nester soils have an argillic horizon, do not have aquic conditions, and are on higher landscape positions."

Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between November and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. Permeability is slow."
