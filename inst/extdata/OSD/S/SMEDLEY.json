  "OVERVIEW": "The Smedley series consists of shallow well drained soils that overlying a strongly cemented hardpan.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks.  These soils are on alluvial fans, fan piedmonts and ballenas.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C., and mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm.",

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Where fans are dissected, short side slopes of up to 30 percent are common.  The soils formed in alluvium derived from andesite, rhyolite, basalt and granitic rocks and are underlain in many areas by Tertiary sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone at a depth of more than 100 cm. Elevations are 1,585 to 2,0242 meters.  Mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm.  Frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."
