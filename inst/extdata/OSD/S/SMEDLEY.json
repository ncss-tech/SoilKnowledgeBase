  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Smedley soils are on alluvial fans with plane or convex slopes, fan piedmonts and ballenas and commonly have a gradient of 2 to 15 percent.  Where fans are dissected, short side slopes of up to 30 percent are common.  The soils formed in alluvium derived from andesite, rhyolite, basalt and granitic rocks and are underlain in many areas by Tertiary sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone at a depth of more than 100 cm. Elevations are 1,585 to 2,0242 meters.  Mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm.  Frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."
