  "OVERVIEW": "The Soudan series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in a mantle of outwash or eolian material and underlying dense till. They are on till plains and till mantled bedrock uplands.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches.",

The very poorly drained Cathro soils formed in organic materials and are in depressions. The well drained Cloquet soils formed in a mantle of loess and underlying outwash. The well drained Conic and moderately well drained Wahlsten soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches."

Albic horizons are in less than 25 percent of all pedons based on field documentation.
