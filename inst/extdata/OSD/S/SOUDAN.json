    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Soudan soils are on linear or convex slopes on till plains and till-mantled bedrock uplands. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. They formed in a mantle of outwash or eolian material and underlying dense till. Mean annual air temperature is 36 to 40 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 27 to 30 inches. The frost-free period ranges from 90 to 120 days. Elevation above sea level is 1400 to 1900 feet."

Somewhat poorly drained Babbitt, moderately well drained Eaglesnest and well drained Eveleth soils do not have sandy textures above the dense till. The very poorly drained Cathro soils formed in organic materials and are in depressions. The well drained Cloquet soils formed in a mantle of loess and underlying outwash. The well drained Conic and moderately well drained Wahlsten soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches."

Albic horizons are in less than 25 percent of all pedons based on field documentation. Lab data will be obtained in the future.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Number MN0868.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
