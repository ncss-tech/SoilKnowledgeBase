They have mollic epipedons and loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections.  Castlepeak soils are on outwash fans, fan terraces and stream terraces.  Castlepeak soils are excessively drained, lack cambic horizons and receive  12 to 16 inches of precipitation.  Langer soils are on mountains and have mollic epipedons.  Yankeefork soils are on outwash fans, fan terraces and stream terraces.  Yankeefork soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections and receive 16 to 20 inches of precipitation."
