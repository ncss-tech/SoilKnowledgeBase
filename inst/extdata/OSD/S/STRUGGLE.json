  "OVERVIEW": "The Struggle series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till from granitic rocks.  Struggle soils are on moraines.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.  Slopes are 5 to 35 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 580 mm and the average annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.",
