Ishkoten soils formed in parent materials from the Animas Formation and have hues as yellow as 2.5Y. Silesca soils have hues as red as 5YR.\nGoldvale soils: have a particle-size control section dominated by medium and coarse, angular, granitic sand.\nLarkson soils: have hue of 7.5YR and yellower.\nLoghill soils: have accumulations of secondary calcium carbonate and have 15 to 50 percent rock fragments in the Btk and Bk horizons.\nSpud soils: formed in parent material weathered from basalt with modification from underlying sandstone and shale.\nSilesca soils: have a lithic or paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches below the mineral surface."

The soil formed in deep colluvium and alluvium from pyroclastic rocks and basalt.  The climate is subhumid with warm moist summers and cold moist winters.  Elevations range from 6,800 to 8,000 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 20 to 25 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 45 F.; average January temperature is 26 F.; average July temperature is 64 F.  Frost-free season is 75 to l00 days."
