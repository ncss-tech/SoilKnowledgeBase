  "OVERVIEW": "The Sclome series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in fine alluvium overlying volcanic ash and valley fill. These soils are in mountain valleys and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F. These soils are usually saturated from December through June but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 30 to 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Depth to the seasonal high water table in winter and early spring is 1 to 2 feet below the surface. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 10 to 16 inches. The particle-size control section averages 22 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent mostly fine pebbles. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 0 through 3 dry or moist. In some pedons, the A horizon is overlain by a thin C horizon 1 to 3 inches thick of recent alluvium, or an Oa horizon 1 to 4 inches thick. Some pedons have an AB, AC or BA horizon below the A horizon.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist. It has weak or moderate, fine or medium blocky structure.\nThe 3BAgb horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist. It is clay loam or silty clay loam. Some pedons lack a 3BAgb horizon. Some pedons have a 3Ab horizon. The 3Bgb horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist. It is stratified sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe 3Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist. It is stratified loamy sand to silty clay loam."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are a mollic epipedon from the surface to 13 inches. Beneath the mollic epipedon is a cambic horizon from 13 to 50 inches.  The cambic horizon is gleyed from 18 to 50 inches. The soil fails to be buried because the mantle at the surface is altered to be the mollic epipedon and part of the cambic horizon.\nThis draft reflects a change in classification from Fluvaquentic Haplaquolls to Fluvaquentic Hapludolls based on the lack of redox features in the 3BAgb horizon. The type location for this series may need revisiting to determine if redox features exist in this zone.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
