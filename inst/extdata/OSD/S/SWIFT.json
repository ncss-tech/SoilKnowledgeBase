The upper part of the particle-size control section averages 10 to 35 percent pumice cinders.  The lower part of the control section averages 40 to 75 percent hard rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 through 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist, 2 or 3 dry.  Subhorizons with a dry value of 5 are less than 10 inches thick.  Hard pebbles range from 5 to 10 percent.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.

The soil formed in colluvium from volcanic ash and basic igneous rock including porphoritic andesite and olivine basalt with a mantle of aerially deposited pumice and volcanic ash of the 176-year old \"Layer T\".  The climate is marine with cool, wet winters and warm, moist summers.  Average annual precipitation is 90 to 120 inches.  Average January temperature is about 32 degrees F.; average July temperature is 64 degrees F.  Average annual temperature is 42 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
