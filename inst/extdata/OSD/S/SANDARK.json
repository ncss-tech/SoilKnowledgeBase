  "OVERVIEW": "The Sandark series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone.  Sandark soils are on fan terraces and toeslopes and have rapid permeability.  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
