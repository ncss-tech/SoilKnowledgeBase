  "OVERVIEW": "The Swanpond series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils.  They formed in residuum weathered from limestone bedrock on nearly level to gently sloping uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

Content of coarse fragments, commonly chert or limestone, ranges from 0 to 20 percent throughout.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid\nto slightly alkaline, unless the soil has been limed.  Depth to redoximorphic features ranges from 30 to 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 through 5. It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have a thin BA horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR value of 4 through 6, and chroma 4 through 8.  Few to many redoximorphic features are present below a depth of 30 inches.  It is typically clay, but some pedons have thin subhorizons of silty clay in the upper part.\nThe BC and C horizons, where present, have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma 4 through 8, with few through many redoximorphic features. It is clay or silty clay."
