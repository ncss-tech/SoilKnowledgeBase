They have formed colluvium and the underlying residuum derived from limestone that has a high chert content and is primarily Ordovician or Mississippian in age.  Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 44 inches."

These soils are on similar landscape positionsas the Sonsac soils."
