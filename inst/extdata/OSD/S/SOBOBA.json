  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist in some or all parts between depths of 12 and 35 inches from about December 1 to April 15.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 63 to 65 degrees F.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown, brown, or pale brown, and has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  It ranges from coarse sand to sandy loam and is gravelly, cobbly or stony in some pedons.  This horizon is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon is commonly somewhat lighter in color, coarser in texture, and higher in proportion of coarse fragments than the A horizon.  Rock fragments make up 35 to 75 percent of the volume of the 10 to 40 inch control section.  Darker colors buried surface soils occur randomly in the C horizon."

Cajon soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section and are dry more than 3/4 of the time.  Carrizo soils have average soil temperature of about 74 degrees F.  Cortina soils have very gravelly sandy loam control sections.  Delhi soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments  in the control section.  Gorgonio soils have dark colored surface horizons, with more than 1 percent organic matter.  Tujunga soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Soboba soils are on alluvial fans and flood plains at elevations of 25 to 3,700 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in recent alluvium, mostly from granitic rocks.  The climate is one of long dry summers and mild, moist winters with an average annual rainfall of 10 to 20 inches.  The average January temperature is 50 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 72 degrees F.; and the average annual temperature is 60 to 62 degrees F.  The frost free season is 260 to 330 days."

Fallbrook soils are upland soils with reddish brown argillic horizons.  Hanford soils have sandy loam texture, with less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Ramona soils are terrace soils with reddish brown argillic horizons.  Vista soils lack many  coarse fragments and have a paralithic contact of weathered granite."
