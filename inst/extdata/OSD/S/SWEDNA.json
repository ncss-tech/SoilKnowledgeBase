  "OVERVIEW": "The Swedna series consists of very deep, very poorly or poorly drained soils that formed in stratified alluvium over gravelly alluvium.  Swedna soils are on floodplains.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are stratified sand through silt.  The upper sediments range from 10 to 37 inches in thickness over very and extremely gravelly sand.  The upper part of the control section is coarse-loamy upon mixing.  Organic carbon content is assumed to vary irregularly with increasing depth.  Depth to a reduced matrix or many redox features ranges from 0 to 10 inches. Reaction throughout the profile ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value moist of 2 through 4; chroma moist of 1 through 3.  Texture is commonly fine sandy loam but ranges to include sandy loam, or fine sand.\nThe C horizon (when present) has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value moist of 3 or 4; chroma moist of 1 through 3.  Texture is stratified sand through silt; occasional pockets and strata of organic materials occur and have texture of muck or mucky peat.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5BG; value moist of 2.5 through 4; chroma moist of 1 or 2. Texture is stratified sand through silt.  These horizons have a reduced matrix and/or common or many redox features; when present, redox concentrations have hue of 5YR through 10YR; chroma moist of 4 through 6; redox depletions have hue of 2.5Y through 5GY; chroma moist of 1 or 2.\nThe 2C horizons are variegated sand and gravel.  Texture includes sand or coarse sand.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 70 percent and include 25 to 60 percent rounded gravel and 0 to 30 percent rounded cobble.  Pockets and strata of sand and silt are common."
