  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The loamy and clayey horizons are l0 to 30 inches thick over saprolite and partially weathered shale.  Thickness of the clayey Bt ranges from 6 to l7 inches.  Depth to hard bedrock is more than 5 feet.  Reaction ranges from very strongly to strongly acid in the A horizon and from strongly acid to slightly acid in the Bt horizon.  Coarse fragments of shale and quartz gravel range from 5 to l5 percent in the A horizon and from 5 to 20 percent in the Bt horizon.  The C horizon contains 50 to 85 percent shale fragments.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or l0YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The A horizon is loam, silt loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, clay, or silty clay.  Thin transitional horizons, when present, may be loam.\nThe C horizon is saprolite that has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 4.  Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction.  Shale fragments range from 50 to 85 percent by volume.  These fragments are typically reddish in color but strata can include brown, gray, or yellowish colored fragments."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Soil series in the same family are Brantley, Canton Bend, Capshaw, Cowton, Enon, Gundy, Hampshire, Maben, Mecklenburg, Meth, and Zion. Brantley and Meth soils are on Coastal Plain uplands, have thicker solum, and hues that range to 2.5YR.  Canton Bend soils are on stream terraces, have mica in the upper sola and more than 30 percent silt.  Capshaw and Hampshire soils are underlain by hard limestone at depths less than 60 inches.  Cowton soils have a Cr horizon at 20 to 40 inches.  Enon, Maben, and Mecklenburg soils have slower permeability.  In addition, Enon and Mecklenburg soils are underlain by dark colored, mixed felsic and mafic crystalline rocks and Maben soils are underlain by stratified loamy and shaly clays.  Gundy soils commonly have hue of 2.5YR and are underlain by soft rock at 40 to 72 inches.  Zion soils have thin Bcn horizons, slow permeability, and hard bedrock less than 40 inches below the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Spray soils are on broad, smooth or convex areas between intermittent drainageways in Triassic Basins of the Southern Piedmont.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in residuum weathered from Triassic shale.  Near the type location, mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 53 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 62 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ayersville, Leaksville and  Pinkston series.  Ayersville soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy, hues of 2.5YR or redder, and commonly are on slightly higher lying knolls.  Leaksville soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy and are on lower lying concave areas around the heads of drains and along intermittent drains. Pinkston soils have less than 35 percent base saturation and are on steeper side slopes at higher elevations."
