    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic features include:\nMollic epipedon: the zone from 0 to 40 inches. (A1, A2, and A3 horizons)\nParticle-size control section: the zone from 10 to 40 inches. (Part of the A2 horizon and A3 horizon)\nSeries last updated by state 7/02.\nActivity class is presumed based on the general trend of other soils in the area.\nThe range in characteristics of this series has become much too broad over the years, and needs to be narrowed back to the original concept.  The original concept of the series is in alluvial parent material, on fan remnants and stream terraces, with an aridic ustic moisture subclass, about 11 to 15 inches of precipitation, and sagebrush grass vegetation.  The original slope range was 0 to 15 percent slopes.  It appears that the original concept did not include a cambic horizon.\nTaxonomic Version: Tenth edition, 2006\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
