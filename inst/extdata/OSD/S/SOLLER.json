  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to the hard fragmental limestone ranges from 20 to 34 inches.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline in the surface layer and from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline in the subsoil.  Calcium carbonate equivalent in the solum is more than 40 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Content of cobbles range from 0 to 30 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay.\nThe Cr horizon consists of soft weathered limestone that can be penetrated with a spade."

The climate is humid tropical.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  The average annual temperature ranges from 76 to 78 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 80 to 90 inches."

The somewhat poorly drained Camaguey soils are very deep, have smectitic control sections, are Vertisols, and are on slower foot slope positions.  Colinas soils are on similar positions, are moderately deep, and have coarse-loamy, carbonatic control sections.  Naranjo soils are very deep, have fine carbonatic control sections and are on similar to lower positions.  Santa Clara soils are moderately deep, have fine mixed control sections and are on lower foot slope positions."
