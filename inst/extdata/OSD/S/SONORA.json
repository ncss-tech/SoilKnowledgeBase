  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness and depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The soil ranges from strongly to very strongly acid, except where limed; the Ap and upper B horizons range to neutral.  Content of course fragments ranges from 0 to 5 percent by volume in the lower part of the solum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  They are silt loam and have moderate, fine or medium granular or subangular blocky structure.  Some pedons have AB horizons, 3 to 10 inches thick, with hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 6.  They are silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  They are silt loam or silty clay loam and have moderate fine, medium, or coarse subangular blocky structure.\nThe 2Bt horizons have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6 and most pedons are mottled in shades of red, brown, or gray.  They are sandy clay loam, clay loam, loam, or fine sandy loam, and have weak or moderate fine or medium, angular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe 3Bt horizons have hue of 10R, 2.5YR, or 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 4 or 6, and are mottles in shades of brown or gray or are evenly mottled in shades of brown, red, and gray.  They are sandy clay loam, sandy clay, clay loam, or clay and commonly have more than 35 percent sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Britwater, Holstein and Negley series of the same family and the Bayless, Crida and Pedridge series in a closely related family.  These soils lack the lithologic discontinuity.  The Britwater soils have 15 to 30 percent gravel in the particle-size control section.  The Holstein soils have strongly expressed argillic horizons formed in colluvium weathered from a mixture of sandstone, limestone, and shale.  The Negley soils have 5 to 35 percent gravel in the sola.  The Bayless Crida and Pedridge soils have a fine-silty textural control section.  In addition, the Baylis soils have an upper solum in loess and a lower in weathered residuum from cherty limestone.  The Crider soils have an upper solum in loess and a lower in either old alluvium or the weathered residuum from limestone and the Pedridge soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR throughout the B2t horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Sonora soils are on uplands with slopes ranging from 2 to 12 percent.  The soils formed in a 10 to 30 inch silt loam mantle over unconsolidated material of sandstone and shale origin which slumped into sinkholes probably during an early cycle of karst erosion of the underlying limestone.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 52 inches."
