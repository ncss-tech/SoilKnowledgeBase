  "OVERVIEW": "The Spieden series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in glacial outwash. Spieden soils are in drainageways and depressions of outwash plains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 24 inches. The average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

All these soils lack an albic horizon. In addition, Granby soils have a frost-free period of 130 to 180 days. Gumz soils have loamy glacial till at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Kentland have an organic horizon 3 to 8 inches thick with marl fragments below the mollic epipedon. Maumee soils have a mollic epipedon 15 to 24 inches thick and the frost-free period is 130 to 180 days."
