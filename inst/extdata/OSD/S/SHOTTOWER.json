  "OVERVIEW": "The Shottower series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on high stream terraces.  They formed in old alluvium derived from sandstone, quartzite, limestone, shale, and siltstone.  Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 55 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.",

Rounded rock fragments of sandstone and quartzite range from 0 to 35 percent in the A and Bt horizons, and from 0 to 60 percent below 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid.\nThe A horizon, where present, is less than 3 inches thick and has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction, with silty clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam in severely eroded areas.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Christiana, Dunmore, and Tumbling series are in the same family. Christiana soils formed in unconsolidated sediments on the upper coastal plain and do not have rock fragments. Dunmore soils formed in residuum from limestones and dolomites and rock fragments are dominantly chert. Tumbling soils formed in colluvium and have semirounded rock fragments."

The soils formed in old alluvium derived primarily from materials weathered from limestones, shales, siltstones, sandstones, and quartzites mixed with materials derived from crystalline rocks.  Mean annual air temperature is 55 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 42 inches."

Allegheny soils have less clay in the subsoil and are on low stream terraces.  Austinville soils have darker subsoils and are on convex uplands.  Chiswell and Litz soils are more shallow to bedrock and are on convex uplands.  Frederick soils are on convex uplands with no rounded gravel or cobbles. Groseclose soils have thinner sola and occur on convex uplands.  Marbie soils have Bx horizons and are in upland drainageways and depressions.  Wyrick soils have less clay in the subsoil and are in upland drainageways and depressions."

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 10 inches (Ap horizon). 2.
