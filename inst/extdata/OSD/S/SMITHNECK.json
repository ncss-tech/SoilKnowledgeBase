  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum is 18 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 11 to 19 inches. The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches varies from 50 degrees to 52 degrees F. The soil moisture control section, about 8 to 24 inches, is usually dry all of the time from July 15 to November 15 and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year. The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from March 15 to November 15 and exceeds 47 degrees F from April 1 to November 1.\nThe A horizon is lOYR 4/1, 4/2, 5/2 or 5/3. Moist color is lOYR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2 or 3/3. Texture is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam with 10 to 15 percent clay.\nThe Bt horizon is lOYR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3 or 6/2. Moist color is lOYR 3/2, 3/3 or 4/2. Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam with 15 to 18 percent clay. Absolute clay increase from the A to the Bt horizon is 3 to 6 percent.\nThe C horizon is lOYR 5/4, 5/2 or 2.5Y 7/2. Moist color is lOYR 4/2, 4/3 or 4/4. It is more or less stratified and ranges in texture from gravelly loamy coarse sand to sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Smithneck soils are on flood plains, stream terraces or footslopes of alluvial fans. Elevation is 4,500 to 5,400 feet. Slopes are O to 2 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. The climate is dry subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 25 inches. Mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 69 degrees F and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F. Frost-free season is 80 to 100 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Balman, Bidwell, Coolbrith, James Canyon and Ramelli soils. The Calman soils are fine-loamy and have calcareous A horizons. Bidwell soils have calcareous Bt horizons and are fine-loamy. Coolbrith soils have Bt horizons with 27 to 35 percent clay. James Canyon soils are fine-loamy and are poorly drained. The Ramelli soils are clayey over loamy and are poorly drained."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability. A seasonal high water table is at a depth of 3 to 5 feet at some time from December to June. Flooding is rare for very brief periods from January through March. Drained phases are recognized that have a seasonal high water table at 5 to 6 feet due to stream channel entrenchment."
