  "OVERVIEW": "The Smithneck series consists of very deep somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Smithneck soils are on flood plains or alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches varies from 50 degrees to 52 degrees F. The soil moisture control section, about 8 to 24 inches, is usually dry all of the time from July 15 to November 15 and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year. The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from March 15 to November 15 and exceeds 47 degrees F from April 1 to November 1.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 5/2 or 5/3. Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2 or 3/3. Texture is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam with 10 to 15 percent clay.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3 or 6/2. Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3 or 4/2. Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam with 15 to 18 percent clay. Absolute clay increase from the A to the Bt horizon is 3 to 6 percent.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 5/4, 5/2 or 2.5Y 7/2. Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3 or 4/4. It is more or less stratified and ranges in texture from gravelly loamy coarse sand to sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam."

A seasonal high water table is at a depth of 3 to 5 feet at some time from December to June. Flooding is rare for very brief periods from January through March. Drained phases are recognized that have a seasonal high water table at 5 to 6 feet due to stream channel entrenchment."
