  "OVERVIEW": "The Snettisham series consists of shallow to bedrock, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from phyllite and schist on hillslopes and mountainslopes.  Slopes range from 35 to 55 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is in excess of 60 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  MAST ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  The thickness of the solum ranges from 2 to 14  inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 14  inches.  Reactions increase with depth, ranging from extremely acid to slightly acid. Coarse fragment content in the control section ranges from 0 to 30 percent schist channers.  Colluvial activity has resulted in the formation of buried horizons in many profiles.\nCombined thickness of the O horizons range from 2 to 8 inches. The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value from 3 to 6 and chroma from 1 to 4. Texture is sandy loam or silt loam. Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent channers.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue from 5YR to 10YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sandy loam or silt loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent channers.  Prominent or distinct mottles are commonly present in the lower part of the horizon.\nA mottled Bs and/or C horizon are present in some pedons.  When present, the C horizon has greater than 35 percent coarse fragments."
