  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  MAST ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  The thickness of the solum ranges from 2 to 14  inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 14  inches.  Reactions increase with depth, ranging from extremely acid to slightly acid. Coarse fragment content in the control section ranges from 0 to 30 percent schist channers.  Colluvial activity has resulted in the formation of buried horizons in many profiles.\nCombined thickness of the O horizons range from 2 to 8 inches. The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value from 3 to 6 and chroma from 1 to 4. Texture is sandy loam or silt loam. Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent channers.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue from 5YR to 10YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sandy loam or silt loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent channers.  Prominent or distinct mottles are commonly present in the lower part of the horizon.\nA mottled Bs and/or C horizon are present in some pedons.  When present, the C horizon has greater than 35 percent coarse fragments."
