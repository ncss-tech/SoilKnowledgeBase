  "OVERVIEW": "The Swencan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits and alluvium over basalt. Swencan soils have slopes of 0 to 12 percent and are on nearly level to rolling, wide, lava-filled valley floors. The mean annual precipitation is about 380 millimeters, and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
