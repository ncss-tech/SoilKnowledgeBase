    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist and are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for less than 45 consecutive days within the 3-month period following summer solstice in most years. The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 47 to 55 degrees F. The solum is 4 to 6 feet thick. Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 inches to more than 10 feet. The particle-size control section has strongly contrasting classes (medial over loamy). The medial part has moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 grams per cubic centimeter, phosphate retention of greater than 85 percent, 2.0 to 4.0 percent acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, 2.0 to 15 cmol/kg of KCl-extractable aluminum, and 15-bar moisture content (air-dried) of 15 to 30 percent, with 18 to 27 percent clay content by field estimate. The loamy part has moist bulk density of greater than 1.0 grams per cubic centimeter, phosphate retention of greater than 85 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron content of less than 2.0 percent, and 15-bar moisture content (air-dried) of 12 to 30 percent, with 25 to 35 percent apparent clay content by field estimate. Rock fragment content in the particle-size control section is 15 to 35 percent, averaging less than 30 percent. Pararock fragments range from 0 to 30 percent in the solum. The umbric epipedon is greater than 20 inches thick, and includes most if not all of the Bw horizon. Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is medial loam or gravelly medial loam with 18 to 27 percent clay content by field estimate, with 0 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, and 0 to 15 percent pararock fragments. It has 10 to 15 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist to a depth of at least 20 inches, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry; below 20 inches the value is 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma is 3 or 4 moist and dry. The upper part of the Bw horizon has andic soil properties.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is medial loam or  medial clay loam and averages 20 to 30 percent clay. The lower part of the Bw horizon lacks andic soil properties. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam and averages 20 to 35 percent clay. This horizon has 10 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles, 0 to 5 percent stones, and 0 to 25 percent pararock fragments.\nThe BC horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 3 to 4 moist and dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, gravelly or clay loam and averages 20 to 35 percent clay by field estimate.  It has 15 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 35 percent cobbles, 0 to 15 percent stones, and 0 to 45 percent pararock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Slickrock soils occur on footslopes, toeslopes, and summits of mountains. Elevations are typically 200 to 1,800 feet, but range from 50 to 2,500 feet. These metastable to active landforms are typified by uneven, step-like benches caused by sliding and slumping bedrock, and reflect ongoing side slope erosional processes on the associated landscapes. Slope range from 0 to 75 percent. The soils formed in more recent loamy colluvium overlying older loamy colluvium and residuum in ancient landslide deposits weathered from arkosic sandstone and other sedimentary rock types. Depth to a paralithic bedrock contact  occurs at a depth greater than 4 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, moist summers tempered by the influence of marine air patterns. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 120 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.  The average January temperature is 38 to 40 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 60 to 66 degrees F. The frost-free period is 110 to 220 days."

Digger, Remote and Umpcoos soils are skeletal. Hembre soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a lithic contact. Kilowan soils are fine-textured and 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. Preacher soils have umbric epipedons less than 20 inches thick."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, recreation, wildlife habitat, and watersheds. The coniferous tree canopy is dominated by Douglas fir, hemlock and western red cedar; hardwoods are more common nearer the coast than farther inland. The understory is mixed shrubs and herbs with some combination or all of the following plants: vine maple, swordfern, salmonberry, devils club, salal, oxalis, thimbleberry and minor amounts of other plants. On cutover or burned over areas, brackenfern, vine maple, swordfern, western dewberry and fireweed are usually present in large amounts."
