  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonate typically is 30 to 35 inches and ranges from 20 to 49 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 40 inches thick and extends into the Btn horizon. Gypsum crystals are above or mixed with horizons of carbonate accumulation and are at depths below 20 to 30 inches.  The natric horizon contains an estimated SAR or ESP of 10 to 20.  Thickness of the interfingering or tonguing of E horizon into Bt horizon is 2 to 4 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam, and ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has value of 5 or 6, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam, and is slightly acid or neutral.  B/E or E/B horizons have colors of the E and B horizons.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay averaging between 35 to 45 percent clay.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Btnz, Bz, and Bkz horizons have value of 5 to 7, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam and is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Few to many accumulations of gypsum, other salts and carbonate are in most pedons.  Few to common redox features are in some pedons, below a depth of 30 inches. Some pedons have Bk horizons without gypsum or other salts.\nThe C horizon typically is multicolored and has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam or loam.  It has common or many accumulations of carbonate.  The C horizon is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Few to common redox features are in some pedons."

Slope gradients typically are 0 to 3 percent, but range from 0 to 6 percent. The soils formed in calcareous clay loam or loam glacial till.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 24 inches."

Dudley and Jerauld soils do not have tonguing and interfingering of the albic horizon into the argillic horizon and are in similar landscapes.  Prosper soils do not have a natric horizon and are in swales.  Tetonka soils are wetter and are in depressions."
