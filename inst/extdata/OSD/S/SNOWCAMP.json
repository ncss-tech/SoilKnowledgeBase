The soils are usually moist but are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle size control section averages 20 to 35 percent clay and has 35 to 80 percent total rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  Soil reaction is slightly acid to neutral throughout.  Hue is 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR in the solum.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 4 to 6 dry.  The texture of the fine earth fraction is loam averaging 15 to 25 percent clay.  It has 0 to 20 percent boulders, 0 to 15 percent stones, 5 to 30 percent cobbles, and 10 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  The texture of the fine earth fraction is clay loam or loam averaging 20 to 35 percent clay.
