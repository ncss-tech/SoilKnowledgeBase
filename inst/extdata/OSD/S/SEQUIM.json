  "OVERVIEW": "The Sequim series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in old alluvium.  These soils are on river terraces and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2AC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is very gravelly loamy sand, very cobbly loamy sand, or extremely cobbly loamy sand.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.
