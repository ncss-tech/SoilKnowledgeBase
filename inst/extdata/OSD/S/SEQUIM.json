The mollic epipedon is 15 to 23 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  This horizon has granular or subangular blocky structure.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2AC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is very gravelly loamy sand, very cobbly loamy sand, or extremely cobbly loamy sand.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.

The soils are in a mild marine climate and have cool, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches. The average January temperature is about 38 degrees F.; the average July temperature is about 60 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.
