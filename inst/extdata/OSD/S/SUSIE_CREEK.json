  "OVERVIEW": "The Susie Creek series consists of deep and very deep well drained soils that formed mostly in residuum derived from weakly consolidated tuff, andesite, welded tuff, rhyolite and basalt with some influence from loess and volcanic ash. The Susie Creek soils are on fan piedmont remnants with a rock core, rock pediment remnants, plateau and foothill side slopes and summits. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
