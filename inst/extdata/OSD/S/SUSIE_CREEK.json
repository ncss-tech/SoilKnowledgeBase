  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Susie Creek soils are on rock pediment remnants, fan piedmont remnants with a rock core, plateau and foothill side slopes and summits and in some areas, on fan piedmonts with rock core. These soils formed in material weathered derived from weakly consolidated tuff rhyolite, andesite and basalt with some influence from loess and volcanic ash. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1,520 to 2,130 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 100 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Pattani, Pie Creek and Toeja soils. Pattani soils do not have argillic horizons and have deep cracks that open and close upon drying and wetting. Pie Creek soils have E horizons, abrupt textural changes and very-fine argillic horizons. Toeja soils have fine-loamy argillic horizons and due not have horizons cemented with silica."
