  "OVERVIEW": "The Sirref series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from diorite.  These soils are on glacial outwash fans at elevations of 8,200 to 9,000 feet.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Average annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches; mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

Rock fragments range from 35 to 50 percent in the upper 20 inches of the Bt and clay averages 35 to 45 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  This horizon is neutral and mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  The upper part of the Bt is gravelly or very gravelly clay and very gravelly clay loam with 35 to 45 percent clay.  The lower part is very cobbly clay, extremely stony sandy clay loam and extremely cobbly clay with 30 to 50 percent clay.  The upper part of the Bt is 35 to 50 percent rock fragments and lower part is 50 to 70 percent rock fragments.  It is noncalcareous in the upper part and slightly calcareous to strongly calcareous in the lower part.  This horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline."
