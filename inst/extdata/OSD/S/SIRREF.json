These soils are continuously moist in some part of the moisture control section for at least 90 consecutive days during the time the soil temperature at 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or higher.  The mollic epipedon is 11 to 15 inches thick.  Depth to the upper boundary of the Bt2 is 3 to 14 inches.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 50 percent in the upper 20 inches of the Bt and clay averages 35 to 45 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  This horizon is neutral and mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  The upper part of the Bt is gravelly or very gravelly clay and very gravelly clay loam with 35 to 45 percent clay.  The lower part is very cobbly clay, extremely stony sandy clay loam and extremely cobbly clay with 30 to 50 percent clay.  The upper part of the Bt is 35 to 50 percent rock fragments and lower part is 50 to 70 percent rock fragments.  It is noncalcareous in the upper part and slightly calcareous to strongly calcareous in the lower part.  This horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sirref soils are on glacial outwash fans and mountain slopes.  Elevations range from 8,200 to 9,000 feet.  These soils formed in alluvium from diorite and mixed sedimentary rocks.  Mean annual is 39 to 42 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches.  The freeze-free period is 60 to 90 days.  GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Falcon, Flygare, Herm, Tomasaki, Tukuhnik and Skylick soils.  The Falcon soils have bedrock at 10 to 20 inches.  Herm, Tomasaki, Tukuhnik and Skylick soils are not skeletal.  Flygare and Skylick soils have cryic temperature regimes."
