  "OVERVIEW": "The Shangland series consists of moderately deep, well\ndrained soils on hills.  They formed in residuum and\ncolluvium derived from quartz diorite.  Slopes are 2 to 35\npercent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches,\nand the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
