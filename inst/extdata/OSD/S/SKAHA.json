These soils are usually dry in all parts between depths of 12 and 35 inches for more than half the time that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F (about 105 to 115 consecutive days).  Organic matter content in the epipedon is less than 1 percent.  The particle-size control section averages 40 to 75 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4 dry or moist, or is multicolored.  It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or coarse sand.  The upper part is gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly and is 15 to 50 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.  The lower part is very gravelly, extremely gravelly, very cobbly, or extremely cobbly and is 30 to 60 percent gravel, 5 to 30 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alderdale, Burbank, Crunkvar, Denio, Doowak, Sheeprock, Ulymeger (T), and Wrango series.  Alderdale soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Burbank and Doowak soils are calcareous in part of the particle-size control section.  Crunkvar soils are more than 50 percent 2-to-5 millimeter pebbles in the particle-size control section.  Sheeprock and Wrango soils are calcareous throughout the particle-size control section. Denio soils are dominated by 2 to 5 mm. sinze gravel and formed in material from granite.  Ulymeyer soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 57 to 59 degrees F and are dominated by cobbles and stones."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Skaha soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments.  These soils formed in glacial outwash of mixed mineralogy.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  Elevations range from 700 to 2,500 feet.  The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 74 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 190 days."

In addition, Aeneas and Pogue soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, Cashmere and Cashmont soils are coarse-loamy, and Strat soils are loamy-skeletal.  Beverly soils have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth.  Ewall and Quincy soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, and also lack a mollic epipedon."
