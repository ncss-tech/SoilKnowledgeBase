  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The carbonate free part of the solum typically ranges from 6 to 8 inches; however, some pedons contain free carbonates to the surface.  The control section averages between 25 and 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 18 inches in thickness.  The surface has stones and boulders in the pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and 2 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is clay loam, but some is loam, very stony loam and extremely stony loam.  It typically is slightly acid or neutral but ranges to moderately alkaline when cultivated.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is clay loam, but some is loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Soil areas in native grass have prominent worm holes and worm casts throughout the Bw horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 .  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon that is similar to the C horizon but has weak to moderate, coarse to extremely coarse prismatic structure (often referred to as cleavage planes in the past)\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is clay loam but some pedons are loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Mottles inherent to the parent till are common in the C horizon.  Gypsum crystals frequently are below depths of 40 inches."

The Shindler soils formed in firm, clay loam calcareous glacial till.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 49 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation from 20 to 26 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Crofton, Egan, Houdek, Moody, Nora, Renner, and Steinauer soils. Crofton, Egan, Moody, and Nora are on higher parts of the landscape above the Shindler soils.  These soils have a fine-silty control section. Houdek and Renner soils have an argillic horizon.  Houdek soils are on similar landscapes and have an argillic horizon.  Steinauer soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are on adjacent steeper convex landscapes."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Less sloping areas are used to grow corn, soybeans, small grains, and alfalfa.  More steeply sloping areas are in native grass, hayland, or woodland.  Native grasses are big bluestem, little bluestem, indiangrass, and green needlegrass.  Principal native trees are bur oak, American elm, ash, basswood, ironwood, and cottonwood."
