  "STATES": "IA,MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Seymour series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess.  These soils are on convex ridgetops and side slopes on dissected till plains and on treads on stream terraces in river valleys.  Slope ranges from 2 to 9 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 950 millimeters.",
