  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is about 47 to 53 degrees F.  The soil is usually moist, but is dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches thick, and the solum is 30 to about 50 inches thick.  Dark colors in the lower part of the argillic horizon are due mainly to dark basaltic sand and silt grains.  Depth to a calcareous material ranges from from about 24 to 36 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.  It is commonly loam but ranges clay loam.  This horizon ranges in rock fragments from nearly free of gravel, stones or cobblestones, to extremely stony, extremely cobbly or very gravelly.  It is slightly acid or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 dry or moist.  The fine earth fraction is clay loam or loam, and has 18 to 35 percent clay.  Rock fragments consist of stones, cobbles, and pebbles, and average 35 to 70 percent of the volume in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon consists essentially of rock fragments (about 80 to 90 percent by volume) with loamy soil material filling the interstices.  The fine earth fraction is slightly calcareous or noncalcareous."

Crookston soils have A horizon with chroma of 1, loam or silt loam argillic horizons, strongly calcareous calcic horizons, and less than 35 percent rock fragments.  Newell soils have silty clay loam argillic horizons and less than 15 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon.  Nomara soils have frigid temperatures.  Roystone soils have A horizons with chroma of 1, and less than 10 percent rock fragments in the profile."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Squaw soils are on alluvial and colluvial fans and foot slopes and have gradients of 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from basaltic material.  Elevations are 2,400 to 3,500 feet.  The climate has warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual summer temperature is 66 to 72 degrees F. and the mean annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F.  The frost free season is about 130 to 160 days."
