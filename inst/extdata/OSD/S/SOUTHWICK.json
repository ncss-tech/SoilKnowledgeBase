    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon\n*Mollic epipedon--zone from 0 to 56 cm\n*Albic horizon--zone from 86 to 97 cm; not an alboll because albic horizon does not directly underly mollic epipedon and no redoximorphic concentrations in or below albic horizon\n*Argillic horizon--zone from 97 to 150 cm\n*Cambic horizon--zone from 56 to 86 cm\n*Oxyaquic feature--zone beginning at a depth of 86 cm that is saturated with water 30 cumulative days or more\n*Particle-size control section--zone from 97 to 147 cm\nThis pedon does not meet the criteria for the aquic subgroup based on the absence of redoximorphic depletions (zones with chroma less than that of matrix) within a depth of 75 cm of the mineral soil surface. The Btxb horizon is not considered to meet the criteria for a fragipan, but further review is needed.\n5/2000--The classification of this series was changed from fine-silty, mixed, mesic Boralfic Argixerolls to fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Oxyaquic Argixerolls based on a revision to Soil Taxonomy.\n12/2010--The type location was moved from Benewah County, Idaho, to the current location to reflect a non-vitrandic subgroup.\nFurther investigation of MLRA 9 is needed to determine several classification issues (vitrandic/non-vitrandic; fragipan/non-fragipan; alboll/non-alboll) and to evaluate the slope and landform of the existing mapped Southwick components and their relationship to these classification issues.\n6/2016--This official series description (OSD) was updated as part of the final correlation of the Spokane County, Washington, soil survey. These soils may have volcanic ash above the Btb horizon; further investigation required. The formatting was updated according to SSR1 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015).\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data--Nez Perce County; Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory sample number 86P 880, soil survey sample number S86ID 069 001\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
