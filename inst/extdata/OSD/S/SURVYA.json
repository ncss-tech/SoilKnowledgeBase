  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to the unconformable very gravelly C materials range from 10 to 16 inches.  These soils are usually dry, mainly during the late spring, summer, and early fall months. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 degrees  to 53 degrees F. The sola and upper part of the C horizons are calcareous, and range in pH from 9.0 to 9.6 with highest pH usually in the B2t horizon. The remainder of the profile is noncalcareous and ranges from pH from 7.8 to 8.8. Unconformable overblown Al horizons of loamy fine sand or fine sand can occur on these soils ranging up to 14 inches thick, but averages 1 to 4 inches thick. These materials have value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or lOYR, value of 7 or 6 dry and 4 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 1 dry. It is usually massive, but has weak or moderate very thin to medium platy structure in some pedons.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of lOYR or 2.5Y, value of 7 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe B21t horizon has weak to strong fine or medium columnar structure and the B22t horizons are similar in grade and durability but are prismatic. The weaker B2t horizons, when displaced, have moderate fine or medium subangular or angular blocky structure. Segregated lime occurs in the lower part of the B2t horizons and ranges from few to many, fine or medium. The argillic horizon, after mixing, is predominantly clay, but includes heavy clay loam.\nThe B3t horizon contains up to 60 percent gravel by volume. When mixed, the argillic horizon contains from O to 35 percent gravel.\nThe C horizon varies widely in color depending upon the color of individual sand grains or gravel. Hue is lOYR or 2.5Y, value is 4 through 7 dry and 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3. Discontinuous massive lenses are found in the IIC material that are slightly hard or hard and range up to 6 inches thick. Occasional very thin silica coatings may occur on some pebble bottoms in these strata."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Churchill, Harding, Flattop, and Uvalde series. Churchill soils contain tufa fragments in the B3tca horizons and overlie lacustrine clay. Flattop soils have mean annual soil temperatures more than 59 degrees F., prismatic clay loam or light clay loam B2t horizons, and are weak or strongly lime-cemented in unconformable very gravelly materials. Harding soils have prismatic clay B2t horizons of mixed mineralogy over white, limy lacustrine clay IIC horizons. Uvalde soils differ by having heavy silty clay loam or silty clay B2t horizons with subangular blocky structure over silty clay loam C horizons, and containing 10 to 30 percent by volume lime concretions ln the Cca horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Survya soils are on smooth, gently to moderately sloping off-shore lake terraces at elevations of 4,500 to 5,000 feet.  Slope gradients are 2 to 9 percent. These soils formed in loamy alluvium superimposed over very gravelly sandy lacustrine materials both of which have been derived from mixed rock sources including basalt, andesite, tuff, and tuff breccia. The climate is cool, semiarid. Mean annual rainfall is about 5 to 7 inches. The mean annual temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 51 degrees F., mean January temperature about 28 degrees to 31 degrees F., and July temperature about 70 degrees to 71 degrees F"
