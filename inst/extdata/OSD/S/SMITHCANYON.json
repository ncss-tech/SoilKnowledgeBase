(Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). The surface is covered by 5 percent fine gravel, 70 percent medium and coarse gravel and 2 percent cobbles.\nA -- 0 to 7 centimeters (0 to 3 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2); weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots throughout; very few very fine tubular pores; 5 percent fine and 5 percent medium to coarse gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 13 centimeters thick)\nCr -- 7 to 150 centimeters (3 to 60 inches); weathered, fractured extremely weakly cemented granitoid bedrock of low excavation difficulty with very few very fine roots in cracks (greater than 10 centimeters apart)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Smithcanyon soils are on backslopes of hills and mountains. Slopes range from 8 to 75 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitoid rocks. Elevation is 800 to 1,750 meters (2,700 to 5,740 feet). The mean annual precipitation is 175 to 250 millimeters (7 to 10 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 13 to 17 degrees C (55.5 to 62.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 210 to 270 days."

Ironped and Pinecity soils are on warmer hill and mountain backslopes, and both have drier, typic-aridic soil moisture regimes. Ironped soils also have a mean annual soil temperature of 19 to 22 degrees C. Stubbespring soils are on similar landscape positions and have an argillic horizon above a shallow paralithic contact. Thunderclap soils are on nearby, very deep fan aprons over pediments. These soils have a paralithic between 150 and 200 centimeters."
