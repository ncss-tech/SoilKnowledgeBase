  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Smithcanyon series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from granitoid and/or gneissic rocks. Smithcanyon soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes range from 8 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 millimeters (8 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",

Ironped and Pinecity soils are on warmer hill and mountain backslopes, and both have drier, typic-aridic soil moisture regimes. Ironped soils also have a mean annual soil temperature of 19 to 22 degrees C. Stubbespring soils are on similar landscape positions and have an argillic horizon above a shallow paralithic contact. Thunderclap soils are on nearby, very deep fan aprons over pediments. These soils have a paralithic between 150 and 200 centimeters."
