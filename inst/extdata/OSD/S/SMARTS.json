  "OVERVIEW": "The Smarts series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that were formed in alluvium flood plains.  These soils are on steep to very steep coalescing alluvial-colluvial fans and mountain slopes and narrow alluvial flood plains. Slopes are 20 to 70 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C, and the average annual precipitation is about 660 mm.",
