  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick.  The combined thickness of the Al and B2t horizons is 40 to more than 60 inches. Coarse fragments are mainly cobble and gravel size angular sandstone and quartzite rock fragments, ranging from about 5 to 45 percent in the Al horizon, and 35 to 85 percent in the B2t and C horizons. The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature at depth of 20 inches is 59 to 65 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the 4 to 12 inch depth for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the summer in 7 out of 10 years.\nThe Al horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.5 to 3. It has weak to moderate very fine to coarse granular or subangular blocky structure. It is neutral to strongly acid. This horizon is 20 to 40 inches thick. The B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry and 3 through 5 moist, chroma of 2 through 5. It is very cobbly heavy loam or very cobbly light clay loam. This horizon has weak to moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky or weak prismatic structure. It is strongly acid to neutral. It has few to many thin clay films on peds and in pores.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is very cobbly loam to very cobbly sandy loam. This horizon has weak medium to fine subangular blocky structure or is massive. It is neutral or slightly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Smarts soils occur on steep to very steep coalescing alluvial-colluvial fans and mountain slopes and narrow alluvial flood plains at elevations of 5,200 to 9,000 feet. Slopes are 20 to 70 percent. These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium, dominantly from sandstone, quartzite and limestone, but include some argillite, gneiss and schist. The climate is moist subhumid. The average annual precipitation is 18 to 30 inches, the mean annual temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 55 to 65 degrees F., and the frost free season is 60 to 90 days."

Bickmore and Despain soils have horizons of carbonate accumulation. Bickmore and Lucky Star soils have mean summer temperatures of less than 59 degrees F. Broad Canyon soils lack argillic horizons. Durfee soils have more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Durst soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick.  Lucky Star soils have albic horizons and mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick."
