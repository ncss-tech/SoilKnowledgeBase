  "OVERVIEW": "The Savage series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in silty alluvium, loess, or in glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine material.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, drainageways, sedimentary plains and till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
