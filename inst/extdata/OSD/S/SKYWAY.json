  "OVERVIEW": "The Skyway series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in moderately coarse textured, noncalcareous sediments weathered from sandstone, andesite, quartz latite, and rhyolite.  Skyway soils are on mesas, mountain side slopes, plateaus, and foot slopes.  Slopes are 1 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 39 to 47 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 52 to 59 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 16 to 40 inches thick.  Depth to the lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The organic carbon content of the mollic epipedon is .8 to 6 percent and decreases uniformly with depth.  Conductivity is usually less than 1 millimho, calcium carbonate equivalent is less than 1 percent, and exchangeable sodium percentage less than 1.  The soil is 90 to 100 percent base-saturated.  In some pedons a cambic horizon having brighter chroma and moderate grades of structure exists below the mollic epipedon.  The series control section is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam with 10 to 18 percent clay.  Rock fragments are commonly less than 15 percent, but range from 0 to 35 percent, and tend to increase with depth.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is slightly acid through slightly alkaline.  It usually has granular or crumb primary structure but is subangular blocky in some pedons, particularly in the lower part.   It is soft to slightly hard.  The lower part of the horizon may have brighter chroma, higher value, or redder hue than the upper part.\nThe C horizon, when present, has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and is lithochromic.  It is slightly acid through slightly alkaline."

Cindersprings, Coutis, Earcree, Foxvire, Gardner's Fork, Hailman, Moonlight, Naz, Razorba, Taral, and Tosp soils lack a lithic contact above 40 inches.  Shook soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section and have a high proportion of medium and coarse angular sand.  Aycab soils have a paralithic contact at 24 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Skyway soils are on upland mesas, plateaus, mountain slopes, ridgetops, and foot slopes. Elevation generally ranges from 7,000 to 10,500 feet.  In Idaho, elevation ranges from 5,500 to 6,300 feet.  Mean annual temperature is 37 to 40 degrees F., and mean summer temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 35 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the winter and early spring.  Slopes range from 1 to 75 percent.  The soils formed in moderately coarse textured, noncalcareous sediments weathered from sandstone, andesite, quartz latite, and rhyolite, and may have some aeolian influence in the upper part of some pedons."
