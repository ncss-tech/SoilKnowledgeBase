  "OVERVIEW": "The Saturday series consists of deep, well drained soils with moderate permeability that formed in residuum and colluvium from vitric and welded rhyolitic tuffs.  Saturday soils are on mountains and foothills.  Slopes range from 5 to 25 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 460 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 5.0 degrees C.",
