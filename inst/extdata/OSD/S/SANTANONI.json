  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches from the mineral surface. Rock fragments range from 15 to 50 percent in the upper part of the mineral solum and from 35 to 70 percent in the lower part of the mineral solum, with 35 or greater percent weighted average by volume between a depth of 10 inches and the bedrock contact. Stones and boulders cover from .01 to 15 percent of the surface. Reaction ranges from ultra acid to very strongly acid in the surface and subsurface horizons, and from extremely acid to strongly acid in the subsoil.\nThe O horizons have hue of 10R to 10YR or are neutral, with value and chroma of 3 or less. It is fibric, hemic, or sapric material. It has weak or moderate, fine or medium granular or subangular blocky structure. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak fine or medium granular or subangular blocky structure. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bhs horizons, and Bh horizons (where present), have hue of 10R to 7.5YR, with value and chroma of 3 or less. The Bhs and Bh horizons are loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand in the fine earth fraction. Thin horizons of sandy loam or coarse sandy loam are present in some pedons. Ortstein is present in less than 50 percent of some horizons. They have weak or moderate, fine, medium, or coarse granular or subangular blocky structure. Some pedons have weak platy structure. Consistence is very friable to firm. It is moderately or strongly smeary.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand or coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. They have weak or moderate, fine, medium, or coarse subangular blocky structure, or are single grain. Consistence is very friable, friable, or loose.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. They have weak or moderate, fine, medium, or coarse subangular blocky structure, or are single grain. Consistence is very friable, friable, or loose.\nBedrock is anorthositic gneiss (metamorphosed anorthosite)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Santanoni soils are on very steep backslopes of mountains and ridges at elevations greater than 3000 feet. Slope ranges from 35 to 80 percent. The soils formed in sandy colluvium derived from till, with some sandy residual material, overlying anorthositic gneiss bedrock. The mean annual temperature ranges from 30 to 43 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 80 inches. The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 110 days. Elevations range from 3000 to 5400 feet above mean sea level."

Couchsachraga, and Skylight soils occupy similar landscape positions as Santanoni soils, are not skeletal, and are very shallow and shallow to bedrock respectively. Ricker soils are organic and are very shallow or shallow to bedrock. Esther and Wallface soils occupy less sloping, more stable parts of the landscape, are coarse-loamy, and are very deep and moderately deep to bedrock respectively."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Some pedons have enough andic soil properties to key out as Andic Humicryods, and some pedons lacking E horizons will key out as Pachic or Typic Fulvicryands. These are similar soils in use and management to the Typic Humicryods concept.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Albic horizon - the zone from 2 to 3 inches.\nb. Spodic horizon - the zone from 3 to 31 inches (Bhs, and Bs horizons).\nc. Humic Great Group - has 6 percent organic carbon throughout a layer 4 inches or more thick within the spodic horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL laboratory data is available for the following pedons: S93-NY-031-002, and S94- NY-031-003.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
