Apison, Hartsells, Linker, Oktaha and Sipsey soils have  solum thickness and depth to bedrock of less than 40 inches.  Cahaba soils contain mica flakes and generally redder hues in the upper Bt horizon.  Durham soils contain mica flakes in the lower solum and are underlain by saprolite weathered from granite, gneiss or schist.  Emporia soils contain gray mottles below a depth 36 inches and has a seasonally high water table within 3 to 4.5 feet of the surface.  Euharlee soils contains E horizons and are moderately slowly permeable.  Granville soils contain less than 30 percent silt in the particle-size control section and more than 6 meq/100g of exchangeable aluminum.  Kempsville soils contain Bt horizons that are brittle and somewhat compact in as much as 40 percent of the mass.  Nauvoo soils have a solum thickness of 30 to 50 inches and  soft bedrock at 40 to 60 inches. Olla soils have sola of 30 to more than 70 inches thick, chroma 2 mottles in the BC horizon and chroma 2 colors in the C horizon.  Pirum soils have a solum thickness and depth to bedrock of 22 to 50 inches. Smithdale soils have sola greater than 60 inches thick.  Stringtown soils contain ironstone fragments throughout and  1 to 4 percent plinthite.  Suffolk soils have a 30 to 50 inch solum and contain less than 30 percent silt in the particle-size control section.  Vaucluse soils contain ironstone fragments and Bt horizons that are dense, brittle and slightly cemented in 10 to 50 percent of the mass."
