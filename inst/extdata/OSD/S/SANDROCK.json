  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sandrock soils are on structural benches. They formed in volcanic ash and slope alluvium derived from basaltic tuff and tuff-breccia. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,435 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm with an annual snowfall of about 530 mm. The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

Lostforest soils are ashy, have cambic horizons and durinodes, and are moderately deep to lithic contacts. Morehouse soils are ashy, very deep, do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons, and occur on dunes and sand sheets. Puzzlebark soils are ashy, have cambic horizons, and are shallow to thin duripans over lithic contacts."
