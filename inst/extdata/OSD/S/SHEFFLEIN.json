The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is moderately or slightly acid.  It has 2 to 4 percent organic matter.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist and 5 through 7 dry and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  It is clay loam, loam or sandy clay loam and has 15 to 40 percent coarse or very coarse sand.  It has base saturation by sum of cations of 75 to 85 percent.  It is moderately or slightly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Shefflein series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes, ridges and alluvial fans.  These soils are formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rocks.  Elevations are 1,000 to 4,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 40 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 160 days.  Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent."

Offenbacher soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Tallowbox soils are coarse-loamy and 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Barron soils are coarse-loamy.  Kubli soils are fine-loamy over clayey and are somewhat poorly drained."
