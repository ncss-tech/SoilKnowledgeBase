  "OVERVIEW": "The Shefflein series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum weathered from granitic rocks.  Shefflein soils are on mountain slopes, ridges and alluvial fans and have slopes of 2 to 35 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches.",
