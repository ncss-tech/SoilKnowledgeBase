Bonduel soils are nearby where there is limestone bedrock at a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). In similar landscapes positions, where the till contains more sand, the Tilleda soils are associates."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Symco soils appear to straddle Aquic Argiudolls and Aquollic Hapludalfs depending upon thickness of the mollic surface, dry color of the mollic surface, and depth to the bottom of the argillic horizon.  More pedons can be placed with Aquollic Hapludalfs and this will be the concept.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon -  0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 inches) (Ap); argillic horizon - 20 to 53 cm (8 to 21 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3);  Mollic subgroup  Ap horizon with color value and chroma moist of less than 4 and color value, dry, less than 6; Aquic feature  redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less and saturation in the upper 25 cm (10 inches) of the argillic horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA; Refer to soil survey sample number S79WI-135-005 for NSSL data on the typical pedon."
