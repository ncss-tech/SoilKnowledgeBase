Ashippun soils have shale fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Kibbie soil are stratified in the lower part of the series control section. Lourdes soils have a calcium carbonate equivalent of less than 15 percent in the till substratum. Marker soils have a densic contact at a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Montmorenci soils have hues yellower than 7.5YR in the subsoil and substratum."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 864 mm (27 to 34 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.2 to 9.4 degrees C (45 to 49 degrees F)."

The well drained Hortonville soils form a drainage sequence with the Symco soils.  In nearby low-lying areas are the poorly drained Angelica soils.  Bonduel soils are nearby where there is limestone bedrock at a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). In similar landscapes positions, where the till contains more sand, the Tilleda soils are associates."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low to moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers per second) or moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second). Permeability is slow or moderately slow. These soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of  31 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) for some time in most years."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Symco soils appear to straddle Aquic Argiudolls and Aquollic Hapludalfs depending upon thickness of the mollic surface, dry color of the mollic surface, and depth to the bottom of the argillic horizon.  More pedons can be placed with Aquollic Hapludalfs and this will be the concept.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon -  0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 inches) (Ap); argillic horizon - 20 to 53 cm (8 to 21 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3);  Mollic subgroup  Ap horizon with color value and chroma moist of less than 4 and color value, dry, less than 6; Aquic feature  redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less and saturation in the upper 25 cm (10 inches) of the argillic horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA; Refer to soil survey sample number S79WI-135-005 for NSSL data on the typical pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
