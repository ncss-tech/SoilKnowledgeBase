  "STATES": "PA,WV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Shinglehouse series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained to moderately well drained soils that formed in frost churned residuum weathered from acid sandstone, conglomerate, shale, or derived from thin localized glacial till.  They occur on summits, shoulders and back slopes. Slopes are 0 to 25 percent. Frost-free days are 95 to 110 days. The mean annual precipitation is 1085 mm (43 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C. (43 degrees F.).",
