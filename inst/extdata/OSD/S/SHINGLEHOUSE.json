    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock is greater than 152 cm (60 inches). Thickness of the mineral solum is 100 to 200 cm (39 to 79 inches). Depth to spodic horizon is 8 to 61 cm (3 to 24 inches). Depth to fragipan is 41 to 76 cm (16 to 30 inches). Depth to seasonal high-water table is 30 to 56 cm (12 to 22 inches). Rock fragments are typically gravel size sandstone, and range in volume from 0 to 30 percent in the A, E, and upper B horizons; and 5 to 70 percent in the Bx horizons and below. Soil reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid throughout.\nThe O horizon is organic material in various stages of decomposition. It is slightly to moderately decomposed (fibric or hemic) leaf litter from oaks, northern hardwoods, hemlock, red spruce and ferns. The combined thickness of the O horizon is 3-17 cm (1 to 7 inches).\nThe A horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 0 through 3; or is Neutral with value of 2 through 4.  It is silt loam, loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons are highly organic.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 through 4.\nIt is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 4. It is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. The fine-earth fraction typically has less than 20 percent clay.\nThe Bs horizon, if present, has hue of 7.5YR, value of 5 or less, and chroma of 4 or less; or hue of 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 5. It is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. The fine-earth fraction typically has less than 20 percent clay.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. It is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. The fine-earth fraction typically has less than 20 percent clay. Structure is commonly blocky or subangular blocky.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, red, or gray are present in some pedons.\nThe Bx horizon (or Bxg where chroma is 2) has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 8. It is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. The fine-earth fraction typically has less than 20 percent clay. Structure is commonly prismatic parting to platy or subangular blocky. Redoximorphic features occur in shades of brown, yellow, red, or gray.\nThe C horizon, if present, (or Cg where chroma is 2) has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 8. It is silt loam, loam, clay loam, sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Redoximorphic features occur in shades of brown, yellow, red, or gray. Some pedons have 2C horizons that have a lithologic discontinuity due to paraglacial solifluction."
