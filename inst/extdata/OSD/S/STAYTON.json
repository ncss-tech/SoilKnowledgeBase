  "OVERVIEW": "The Stayton series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium mixed with ash over basalt bedrock..  They are on footslopes and in drainageways of uplands. Slopes are 0 to 7 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 52 to 56 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist and have a xeric moisture regime.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section is estimated to have a phosphate retention of 90 to 100 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 2.0 to 4.0 percent, and 15-bar moisture of 15 ot 20 percent based on an air-dried sample.  The moist bulk density is 0.70 to 0.85 grams per cubic centimeter. Rock fragments are usually absent but some pedons have up to 10 percent gravel.  The soils are moderately or strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 1 or 2 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist, 2 or 3 dry.  It is silt loam and has less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand.  This horizon has weak or moderate granular or very fine or fine subangular blocky structure.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry."

The soils formed in colluvium mixed with ash or pyroclastic materials over basalt bedrock..  The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F, the mean January temperature is 39 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is 67 degrees F.
