  "OVERVIEW": "The Sioux series consists of excessively drained soils formed in sand and gravel on outwash plains, terraces and eskers.  They are very shallow over sandy-skeletal material.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to sandy-skeletal material ranges from 6 to 14 inches.  Typically, the depth to carbonates ranges from 3 to 10 inches, but some pedons have carbonate at the surface.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon typically is 7 to 10 inches and ranges from 7 to 14 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The fine-earth fraction of the A horizon is loam, sandy loam, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand.  Where the texture is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand, the mollic epipedon exceeds 10 inches in thickness.  The horizon has up to 35 percent rock fragments that are gravel or cobble size.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  The surface of some pedons is covered by stones and boulders.  Some pedons have an AC horizon (where the ABk or BCk horizons are absent.\nThe ABk horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The fine-earth fraction is sandy loam, loamy sand or loam.  The horizon has up to 60 percent rock fragments.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe BCk horizon is most often identified by carbonates coating the undersides of pebbles and occur in the upper part of the sandy-skeletal material.  Some pedons have Bk horizons\nThe C horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The fine-earth fraction is sand, loamy sand or coarse sand.  Individual layers in the C horizon have 15 to 90 percent rock fragments, but the horizon averages more than 35 percent gravel. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Slopes are plane or convex, and gradients range from about 0 to 40 percent. The soil formed in sand and gravel outwash.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 36 to 47 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 16 to 24 inches.  Growing season is about 100 to 140 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches; growing degree days are about 2500 to 3000."

Arvilla soils are in the sandy family, have a cambic horizon, and are typically on less steep landscapes adjacent to the Sioux soils.  Barnes, Buse and Forman soils are fine-loamy and formed in loamy till.  Barnes and Forman soils typically are on plane slopes below Sioux soils.  Buse soils typically have plane to convex slopes and are above or intermixed with Sioux soils.  Divide soils have a calcic horizon within 16 inches and are in plane to concave landscapes adjacent to swales and depressions.  Fordville soils are on footslopes below Sioux soils.  They have a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches thick and have sand and gravel at depths of 20 and 40 inches.  Renshaw soils are on backslopes adjacent to Sioux soils.  They have sand and gravel at depths of 14 and 20 inches."
