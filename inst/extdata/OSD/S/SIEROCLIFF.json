  "OVERVIEW": "The Sierocliff series consists of moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone.  Sierocliff soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",

The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 13 degrees C, and mean summer temperature is 18 to 21 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."
