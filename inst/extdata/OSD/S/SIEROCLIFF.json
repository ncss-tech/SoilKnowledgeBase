  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sierocliff soils are on linear to slightly convex fan remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone with reworked lacustrine materials or loess high in volcanic ash.   Slopes are 2 to 12 percent.  Elevations range from 1,520 to 1,980 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 13 degrees C, and mean summer temperature is 18 to 21 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."
