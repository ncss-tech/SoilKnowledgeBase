Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent. These soils formed in loess and reworked loess, which contains a small amount of volcanic ash in the upper layers. The average annual air temperature ranges from 5.6 to 8 degrees C. The average annual precipitation is 635 to 1080 mm. The average frost-free period is 80 to 130 days."

Benewah soils are on lower-gradient shoulders and backslopes of hills and have a seasonally perched water table at 30 to 61 cm. Carlinton soils are on summits and shoulders of hills and broad interfluves and are moderately deep to a fragipan. Reggear soils are on concave and north-facing sideslopes of hills and basalt plateaus, are moderately deep to a fragipan, and have a udic moisture regime. Arson soils are on higher-gradient, convex shoulders and backslopes of hills."
