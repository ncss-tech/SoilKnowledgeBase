  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Snowtell series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in reworked till derived from volcanic rocks.  Snowtell soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Snowtell soils are on mountains with superimposed moraines.  They typically occur on summit and footslope positions.  They formed in reworked till derived mainly from volcanic rocks such as andesite.  Some areas are influenced by colluvium derived from granodiorite, schist, or gneiss.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 8,000 to 10,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 50 inches, mean annual temperature is 36 to 39 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
