  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the sandy skeletal mantle and depth to sandstone bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches. The rock fragments consist mainly of angular sandstone fragments with some rounded igneous and metamorphic gravel and cobbles present in some pedons. Volume of rock fragments averages from 35 to 60 percent in the particle size control section. The volume of channers and gravel ranges from 0 to 20 percent in the A and E horizons and from 35 to 60 percent in the 2Bw horizon. The volume of flagstones and cobbles ranges from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or is neutral and has value of 2.5 or 3, and chroma of 1. Reaction is very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon, not in all pedons, has hue of 7.5 YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1. It is sandy loam or loamy sand. Reaction is very strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sandy loam, loamy sand, or the channery or gravelly analogues of these textures. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is very channery loamy sand or very channery sand. Reaction is strongly acid.\nThe 3Cr horizon has hue of 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is soft and weathered sandstone. Reaction is very strongly acid."

Sauxhead soils formed in sandy and channery glaciofluvial deposits mainly derived from Jacobsville sandstone. Elevation ranges from 650 to 850 feet. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 29 to 33 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F. Frost-free period ranges from 120 to 140 days."

The poorly drained Jacobsville soils occur in a complex with Sauxhead soils. The somewhat poorly drained Zeba soils occur in shallow depressional areas and drainageways. The moderately well drained Chocolay and the excessively drained Waiska soils occur in a complex and are on nearby higher landscape positions. The moderately well drained Carlshend soils occur nearby in slightly higher positions and formed in loamy till shallow over sandstone."

The soil has a seasonal high water table that perches on the bedrock and ranges from 1 to 1.5 feet below the surface. It is more common in the spring after snow melt, but can occur for short periods from October to June. Permeability is rapid to very rapid."
