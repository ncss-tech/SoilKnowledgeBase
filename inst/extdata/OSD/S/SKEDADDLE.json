  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Skedaddle soils are on mountains, hills, and plateaus.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite and basalt.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,220 to 1,850 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."
