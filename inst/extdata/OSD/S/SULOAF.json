  "OVERVIEW": "The Suloaf series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and material weathered from basalt, andesite, or greenstone.  Suloaf soils are on plateaus, mountains, and northerly aspects of canyons and have slopes of 3 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock and thickness of the solum are more than 40 inches.  The soil is usually moist but is dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 70 consecutive days in late summer and early fall.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F.  Rock fragments are present in the Bt and where present, BC horizons of some pedons and range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in the B horizons.  The solum has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.  The mollic epipedon is 12 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to an argillic horizon is 8 to 20 inches.  Base saturation in parts of the upper 30 inches is less than 75 percent and is 50 to 75 percent in the mollic epipedon.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 4 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It has 25 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 30 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.\nSome pedons do not have a BC horizon above the bedrock.  The BC horizon is usually clay loam, cobbly clay loam, or gravelly sandy loam and its structure is blocky or the soil is massive."

Carmack, Middlefork, Molyneux, Simonton, and Skelter soils are very deep. Elkcreek and Mojo soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Johnson soils have 30 to 60 percent fine sand or coarser and have more quartz grains and mica flakes.  Muldoon soils are deep to a duripan. Trojan soils are usually dry between depths of 10 and 20 inches for more than 100 days."
