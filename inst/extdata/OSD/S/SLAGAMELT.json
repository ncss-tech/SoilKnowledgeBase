  "OVERVIEW": "The Slagamelt series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium, outwash and slide deposits derived from mixed sources.  These soils are on outwash plains, outwash fans, stream terraces, fan remnants, drainageways and landslides. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
