    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches. Depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 40 to 60 inches or more. The particle size control section averages 25 to 35 percent clay. The A and B horizons contain less than 10 percent sand.  Depth to a layer with more than 10 percent sand is less than 60 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has color value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam or silty clay loam and ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 2 to 4. The lower part has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 6. Iron accumulations or depletions have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 1 to 8.  Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, chroma of 2 to 7 and is mottled. It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam and contains over 15 percent sand. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral."

Brenton, Keller, Lafayette, Mundelein and Raub soils have a lithologic discontinuity at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Elburn and Loran soils have average annual temperature in the soil temperature control section of 48 to 53 degrees F. Frankenmuth, Harco, Lisbon and Rooks soils have calcium carbonates at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Higginsville soils contain less than 10 percent sand throughout. Lawndale soils have sand or loamy sand textures at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Nevin soils commonly have less than 15 percent sand throughout and mean annual temperature of less than 54 degrees F. Rowley soils are stratified in the lower part of the solum."

Slopes commonly are 0 to 3 percent, but ranges to 9 percent. The soils formed in loess, loess and alluvium, or silty alluvium. The mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 38 inches."
