  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact and thickness of solum are 40 to 80 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 56 degrees to 58 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of about 5 to 15 inches is dry by late May or early June and remains dry until sometime in October.  Otherwise, it is moist all of the time.  Coarse fragments comprise up to 45 percent of the profile with the highest amount being in the A horizon and the B3t or C horizons.  The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon has from 2 to 30 percent coarse fragments by volume.\nThe A horizon is brown or reddish brown in hue of 7.5YR or 5YR.  Moist chroma is 3 or 4 above 7 inches and 4 below 7 inches.  The A horizon is loam, silt loam, or clay loam.  It is slightly acid or medium acid.  It has 2 to 4 percent organic matter in the upper 4 to 7 inches and less than 1 percent below 10 inches.  The lower boundary of the A horizon is gradual or there is a transitional horizon between the A1 and B2t horizons.\nThe B2t horizon is reddish brown, yellowish red, reddish yellow, dark brown or strong brown in 5YR or 7.5YR hue and chroma is 4 or more.  It is clay, and the average clay content is 35 to 60 percent except in the upper few inches.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline and usually increases with depth.  It has 75 to 100 percent base saturation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Secca soils occur on gently sloping to steep mountainous terrain at elevations between 1,700 and 3,000 feet.  The underlying bedrock consists of metabasic, basic and ultrabasic volcanic rock.  The climate is moist subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches, some of which falls as snow.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees  F.; average January temperature is about 43 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 75 degrees F."
