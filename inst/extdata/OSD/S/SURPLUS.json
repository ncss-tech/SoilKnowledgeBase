  "STATES": "ME,NH,NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Surplus series consists of very deep, moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained soils on mountain side slopes. These soils formed in dense till. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the organic surface layer and the mineral solum, and low to moderately high in the substratum. Slope ranges from 3 to 45 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 1 degree C and mean annual precipitation is about 125 centimeters at the type location.",

Rock fragment content ranges from 3 to 30 percent throughout the mineral soil. The rock fragments are dominantly gravel and channers. Stones and boulders cover 0 to 15 percent of the surface. The soil ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the mineral solum, and is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the substratum. The organic surface layer is usually extremely acid.\nThe Oa horizon, or Oe horizon where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon is neutral or has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and of chroma 0 to 2. It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value and chroma of 2 to 3. The Bh horizon, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value and chroma of 2 to 3. It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction but lenses of loamy fine sand or loamy sand occur in some pedons. Any structural aggregation of soil particles is considered to be inherited from the parent material. Consistence is firm or very firm."

The soils formed in dense till. The mean annual temperature ranges from 0 to 5 degrees C and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 102 to 152 centimeters.

Bemis soils are poorly drained soils on concave positions of the nearby landscape. Sisk soils are well drained soils generally on steeper slopes than Surplus soils, or on slightly convex positions. Enchanted soils are well drained soils typically on steeper slopes with more rock fragments than Surplus soils. Ricker and Saddleback soils are on convex positions. Ricker soils are thin organic soils over bedrock. Saddleback soils are shallow to bedrock."
