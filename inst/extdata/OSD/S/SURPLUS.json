  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 41 to 89 centimeters. Depth to bedrock is more than 152 centimeters. Rock fragment content ranges from 3 to 30 percent throughout the mineral soil. The rock fragments are dominantly gravel and channers. Stones and boulders cover 0 to 15 percent of the surface. The soil ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the mineral solum, and is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the substratum. The organic surface layer is usually extremely acid.\nThe Oa horizon, or Oe horizon where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon is neutral or has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and of chroma 0 to 2. It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value and chroma of 2 to 3. The Bh horizon, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value and chroma of 2 to 3. It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction but lenses of loamy fine sand or loamy sand occur in some pedons. Any structural aggregation of soil particles is considered to be inherited from the parent material. Consistence is firm or very firm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Surplus soils are in high elevation valleys and on smooth side slopes of mountain ridges. The slope gradient ranges from 3 to 45 percent. The soils formed in dense till. The mean annual temperature ranges from 0 to 5 degrees C and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 102 to 152 centimeters. The frost-free season ranges from 30 to 90 days. Elevation ranges from 700 to 1615 meters above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are principally the Bemis and Sisk soils, but also the Enchanted, Ricker, and Saddleback soils. Bemis soils are poorly drained soils on concave positions of the nearby landscape. Sisk soils are well drained soils generally on steeper slopes than Surplus soils, or on slightly convex positions. Enchanted soils are well drained soils typically on steeper slopes with more rock fragments than Surplus soils. Ricker and Saddleback soils are on convex positions. Ricker soils are thin organic soils over bedrock. Saddleback soils are shallow to bedrock."
