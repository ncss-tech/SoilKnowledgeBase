  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sobrante series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from basic igneous and metamorphic rocks. These soils are on foothills and have slopes of 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches and is variable over short distances.  The soils between depths of about 5 to 15 inches are usually moist but become dry in all parts in May or early June and remain dry until October to mid-November.  Coarse fragments throughout the profile range from about 3 to 30 percent with the largest amount usually in the uppermost and lowermost horizons.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 66 degrees F.  The soil is slightly  or moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has dry colors of 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 5/6, 5/8, 4/4; 5YR 5/3, 5/4 and moist colors of 7.5YR 2/4, 3/2, 3/4; 5YR 3/3 or 3/4.  Moist colors of 2/4, 3/2, and 3/3 are usually to a depth of 5 inches or less.  It is silt loam, loam or gravelly loam with 10 to 25 percent clay.  Organic matter ranges from 3 to 7 percent in the upper few inches and from 1.5 to 3 percent at 5 inches.\nThe Bt horizon has dry colors of 2.5YR 5/6, 5/8; 5YR 5/8, 5/6, 4/6, 4/4, 3/4, 3/6; or 7.5YR 5/6 and moist colors of 2.5YR 3/6, 4/6, 4/8; 5YR 3/4, 4/4, 3/6; or 7.5YR 3/4.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, gravelly loam or gravelly clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay and with a 4 to 15 percent (absolute) increase over the A horizon.  Base saturation ranges from 70 to 90 percent.\nSome pedons lack a Cr horizon above the lithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Sobrante soils are on foothills and have slopes of 2 to 75 percent.  Elevation ranges from 125 to 3,500 feet.  They formed in material weathered from basic igneous and metamorphic rocks, mainly amphibolite schist, diabase, andesite, or basalt.  Rock outcrops are common.  The climate is moist subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 50 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 to 60 degrees F; average January temperature about 45 degrees F; and average July temperature about 76 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 200 to 270 days, but may be as few as 140 in Lake Co."

Argonaut soils have more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Auburn soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 20 inches in part of each pedon.  Boomer soils are in cooler sites with a mean soil temperature of less than 59 degrees F."
