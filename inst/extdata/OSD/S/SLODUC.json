  "OVERVIEW": "The Sloduc series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in silty glacio-marine or glacio-lacustrine sediments.  Sloduc soils occur on uplifted marine terraces or on glacial lake plains.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 90 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Thickness of solum ranges from 10 to 27 inches.  The 10 to 40 inch control section has a weighted average of 18 to 35 percent clay with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Texture is typically silt loam or silty clay loam but the range includes some subhorizons of very fine sandy loam, silty clay or clay loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The upper part of the solum is mottled and contains iron and/or manganese concretions.  Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid in the solum and slightly acid or neutral in the C horizon.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value from 3 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value from 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is typically silt loam or silty clay loam but often has thin strata of very fine sandy loam, silty clay or clay loam."
