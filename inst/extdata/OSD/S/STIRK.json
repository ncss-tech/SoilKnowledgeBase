  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages more than 60 percent clay.  Below a depth of 40 inches, strata range from clay to sandy loam.  The profile contains free carbonate in all parts between a depth of 10 and 20 inches and typically is calcareous throughout.  However, some pedons contain thin lenses that do not have free carbonate.  The soil is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.  During dry periods, cracks 1/2 to 3 inches in width and several feet in length extend downward several feet in depth.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay or clay.\nThe AC and C horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Buried dark colored horizons are in some pedons below depths of 30 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stirk soils are nearly level on flood plains and alluvial fans.  Slope gradients are less than 2 percent.  They formed in calcareous clayey sediments derived from clay shale.  Frequency of flooding depends on their position with that of the stream.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 49 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 19 inches."

The Glenberg, Haverson, Lohmiller, and Stetter soils are on similar landscapes.  Glenberg soils are coarse-loamy; Haverson soils are fine-loamy and Lohmiller soils are fine textured.  Opal, Promise, and Sansarc soils are on adjoining uplands and these soils are not stratified. The Stetter soils are drier and are leached of carbonate to greater depths."
