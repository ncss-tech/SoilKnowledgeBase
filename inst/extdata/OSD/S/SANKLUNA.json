  "OVERVIEW": "The Sankluna series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in stratified sandy and silty alluvium.  Sankluna soils are on floodplains.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 18 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The control section is stratified sand, fine sand, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, and silt loam.  The composite texture is sand or loamy sand with less than 50 percent very fine sand.  The soil is slightly acid or neutral.  The organic mat ranges from  0 to 1 inch.\nThe AC horizon has moist hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; moist value of 2 or 3; and moist chroma of 1, 2, or 3.  Texture includes fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, and fine sand.  This horizon is finely stratified in many pedons.\nThe C horizons have moist hue from 10YR and 2.5Y; moist value from 3 or 4; and moist chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is stratified sand, fine sandy loam, and silt loam.  Composite texture is loamy sand or sand.   Dark colors are due to the high concentration of black sand grains.  Occasional pockets and strata of organic materials occur and have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; chroma moist of 1 or 2.  ."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing soils in this family.  Soils in this subgroup include the Salchaket, Susitna and Takotna.  All competing soils have composite textures in the particle-size control section that are coarse-loamy.  In addition, Salchaket soils contain large quantities of micaceous material.  Takotna soils are calcareous within the control section.  Susitna soils are very strongly or strongly acid in the upper horizons."
