  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to more than 40 inches.  Typically, depth to free carbonates range from 0 to 10 inches, but some pedons are leached to depths of 15 inches.  The series control section is loam, silt loam or clay loam and averaging between 18 and 30 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  Strata of coarser textured materials are in some pedons.  Some pedons have buried horizons below depths of 50 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and value of 1 to 3.  It is loam, silt loam or clay loam.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have no accumulation of carbonate.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and 4 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam or clay loam.  It has common or many accumulations of carbonate.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has 5YR to 10YR hue, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The C horizon typically contains strata of loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, and clay loam.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Most pedons have few to many threads of carbonates.  Faint yellow and brown mottles are below depths of 40 inches in some pedons.  A few coarse fragments are in some pedons."

The Davis, Draper, Lynx, Manzano, Maskell, Merrick, and Pack are leached of carbonates to depths greater than 15 inches.  The Humbarger soils have a higher mean annual temperature.  The Shanta soils contain from 5 to 20 percent by volume coarse fragments throughout the series control section."

Barnum and Haverson soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are below the St. Onge soils.  Keith, Nevee, Satanta, Swint, and Tilford soils are on higher landscapes.  The Swint and Tilford soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick.  Keith and Satanta soils have an argillic horizon and Nevee soils do not have a mollic epipedon.  Vale soils typically are on higher landscapes and have an argillic horizon."
