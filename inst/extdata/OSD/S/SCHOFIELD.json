  "OVERVIEW": "The Schofield series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from granite. These soils are on moderately to steeply sloping mountain sides at high elevations. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent or more. The mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.",

Grimstone, Indart, Perceton, Polvadera and Tongue River soils have a paralithic contact above depth of 100 cm.  Ansel, Castelleia, Hierro, Jacquette, Lick, Peeler, Tahoma, Trapper, Uinta and Whitefish soils lack a lithic contact above depth of 100 cm.  Edloe, Limber and Swapps soils are calcareous at depths of less than 100 cm and have secondary calcium carbonate accumulation.  Shule soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments throughout the solum and have rock fragments mainly larger than 250 mm in diameter and are not extremely hard and semi-cemented when dry.  Sapphire soils are stony throughout.  Woodrock soils are moderately to very strongly acid and have a base saturation of less than 60 percent in at least part of the solum."
