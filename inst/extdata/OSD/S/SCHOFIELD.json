  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock range from 20 to 40 inches.  pH remains nearly constant or increases slightly as depth increases, and there is no horizon as thick as 4 inches with pH of 7.5 or higher above bedrock.  The soil is 60 to 100 percent base saturated in all parts of the B2t horizon.  This soil shows very little volume change or wetting and drying, and has extremely hard semi-cemented consistency when dry in those horizons low in organic material.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent by volume in a major portion of the solum and are predominantly fine angular granitic gravel.  The average soil temperature is 34 degrees F., and the average summer soil temperature is 42 degrees F., with an 0 horizon at least 4 inches thick.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1.5 through 3.  Usually it has weak subangular blocky to granular structure but it has weak platy structure in some pedons.  The horizon is soft or slightly hard.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 through 6.  When the hue of this horizon exceeds 7.5YR the colors should not be lithochromic and should be confined to horizons of maximum weathering.  This horizon is typically sandy clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay and with a relatively high percentage of coarse and very coarse angular granitic sand in the sand fraction.  It ranges from pH 6.0 to 7.0."

Grimstone, Indart, Perceton, Polvadera and Tongue River soils have a paralithic contact above depth of 40 inches.  Ansel, Castelleia, Hierro, Jacquette, Lick, Peeler, Tahoma, Trapper, Uinta and Whitefish soils lack a lithic contact above depth of 40 inches.  Edloe, Limber and Swapps soils are calcareous at depths of less than 40 inches and have secondary calcium carbonate accumulation.  Shule soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments throughout the solum and have rock fragments mainly larger than 10 inches in diameter, and are not extremely hard and semi-cemented when dry.  Sapphire soils are stony throughout.  Woodrock soils are medium to very strongly acid and have a base saturation of less than 60 percent in at least part of the solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Schofield soils are on moderately to steeply sloping mountain sides at high elevations.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 50 or more percent.  These soils formed in moderately fine to moderately coarse textured sediments derived from underlying granite.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 20 inches, 12 inches of which falls during the months of April through August."
