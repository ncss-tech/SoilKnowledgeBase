  "OVERVIEW": "The Sagedale series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or in alluvium derived from semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, sedimentary plains, drainageways, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
