  "REVDATE": "06/2005",
  "STATES": "OK,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Shrewder series consist of very deep, well drained, moderately rapid permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvim  of Pleistocene age over residuum from sandstone of Permian age.  These soils are on very gently sloping to moderately sloping stream terraces on alluvial plain remnants in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRAs 78B, 78C).  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",
