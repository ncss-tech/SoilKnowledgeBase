  "REVDATE": "10/2007",
  "STATES": "MN,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Scotah series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium. These soils are on level or gently undulating high flats and natural levees on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
