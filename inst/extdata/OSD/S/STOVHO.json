  "OVERVIEW": "The Stovho series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum weathered from limestone and calcareous, fine-grained sandstone on mountains. They have moderately low and moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Slopes range from 0 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 790 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
