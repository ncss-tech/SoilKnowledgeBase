  "OVERVIEW": "The Santa Lucia series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from white shale containing some ash, and some siliceous and diatomaceous material.  Santa Lucia soils are on uplands and have slopes of 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 59 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.   The mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 65 degrees F.  Soil between the depths of about 5 to 15 inches is usually dry all of the time from late April or May until November or early December and usually moist all the rest of the year.  Angular and subangular shale fragments average 35 to 80 percent.  Most pedons have about 35 to 50 percent fragments are more numerous in the lower part of the profile.\nThe A horizon is usually 3/1, 4/1, 5/1 or 6/1 but is 4/2 or 5/2 in the lower part of some pedons.  Field textures are loam, clay loam or heavy clay loam but laboratory determinations indicate that most pedons have 35 to 50 percent clay.  Organic matter ranges from 2 to 20 percent.  The soil is slightly to strongly acid.  Base saturation is between 50 and 75 percent and closer to 50 than 75 in many pedons.  Structure is weak to strong subangular blocky or granular.  Many pedons have moderate or strong structure.  A few thin, dark colored clay films are present in the lower part of some pedons or in fractures of the underlying rock.  Some pedons have a pale C horizon of soil material a few inches thick just above the bedrock.  In most pedons the A horizons rest on the R layer."

Junipero soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments and have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 59 degrees F.  Butano and Lobitos soils have an argillic horizon.  Crow Hill and Gazos soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments.  San Benito soils are calcareous in some part.  Lopez, Reliz, and Tollhouse soils have a lithic or paralithic contact less than 20 inches below the surface and Reliz soils have an ochric epipedon.  Sheridan soils have less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section."

The soils formed in material weathered from white shale containing some ash and some siliceous and diatomaceous material.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with cool to warm rainless but foggy summers near the coast and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 35 inches.  The average January temperature is 47 degrees to 51 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 63 degrees to 68 degrees F.; the mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees to 60 degrees F.  The annual freeze-free season is 175 to about 300 days."
