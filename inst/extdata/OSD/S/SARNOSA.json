  "OVERVIEW": "The Sarnosa series consists of very deep, well drained, soils that formed in loamy residuum from calcareous sandstone mainly of the Oakville sandstone and sandstone members of the Goliad Formation. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils are on hillslopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.4 degrees C (70.5 degrees F).",
