  "OVERVIEW": "The Stunner series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and outwash derived from granite, gneiss, and mica schist. Stunner soils are on fan remnants, outwash fans, alluvial fans, fan terraces, plateaus, and valley-filling sideslopes and have slopes of 1 to  20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
