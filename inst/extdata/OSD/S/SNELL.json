The soil is usually moist but is dry for 60 to 90 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches after the summer solstice. Solum depth and depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. The soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 36 inches thick and includes all or part of the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry. Texture is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam. It has 0 to 35 percent gravel, 0 to 35 percent cobbles, and 0 to 35 percent stones.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. Moist chroma of 4 and/or moist value of 4 is below a depth of 20 inches. Texture is silty clay, silty clay loam, clay loam or clay and averages 35 to 50 percent clay. It has 0 to 45 percent gravel, 5 to 65 percent cobbles, and 0 to 40 percent stones."

Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. The soils formed in a mixture of loess and basaltic colluvium. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 40 inches. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean July temperature is 59 to 61 degrees F, the mean January temperature is 25 to 30 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 50 to 115 days."
