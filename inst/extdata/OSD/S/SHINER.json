  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Similar soils include the Olmos and Saspamco series.  Olmos soils have mollic epipedons, more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the A horizon, and have a petrocalcic horizon.  Saspamco soils have sola thicker than 20 inches, and have mixed mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shiner soils are on very gently sloping to strongly sloping upland ridgetops.  Slope gradients range from 1 to 12 percent.  The soils formed in beds of strongly calcareous loamy earths containing thin strata of weakly cemented calcareous sandstone, mainly of the Oakville formation.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 70 to 74 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 36 inches.  Elevation ranges from 200 to 500 feet, and frost free days range from 275 to 300.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices ranges from 38 to 50."
