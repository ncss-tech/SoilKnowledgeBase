  "OVERVIEW": "The Samsriver series consists of moderately deep to dense till, moderately well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from alpine glacial till derived from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks on glaciated mountain slopes.  Slopes are 20 to 50 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 190 inches and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
