The mean summer soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. and the mean winter soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The difference between the mean winter and mean summer soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist and have a surplus of available water on a monthly basis throughout the year; perudic moisture regime.  Depth to dense till is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section from 10 inches to the dense till contact has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1 to 2 percent, phosphate retention of 40 to 85 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 10 to 20 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section has 15 to 27 percent field estimated clay and 40 to 60 percent sand.  Base saturation is less than 10 percent by ammonium acetate throughout the profile.\nThe E horizon (albic materials) has value of 5 or 6 moist and 7 or 8 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.

The soils are formed in colluvium and residuum from alpine glacial till derived from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks.  Elevations are 2000 to 3000 feet.  Average annual precipitation is 170 to 210 inches.  Fog drip contributes to the effective precipitation totals.  Average annual temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 120 to 140 days."
