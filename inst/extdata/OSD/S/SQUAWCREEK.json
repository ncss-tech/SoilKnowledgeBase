Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in residuum from welded rhyolitic tuff.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and warm and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation is 330 to 410 mm, and average annual temperature is 4.4 to 7.2 degrees C.  The frost-free season is 65 to 95 days."
