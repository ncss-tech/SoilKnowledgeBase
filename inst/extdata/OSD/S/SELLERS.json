Reaction of the Oa horizon in 0.01M calcium chloride is extremely acid.\nThe Oa horizon, where present, is up to 5 inches in thickness.

Texture is muck.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2, and chroma of 2 or less; or it is neutral with value of 2.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown or gray range from one to common.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand or their mucky analogs.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 or less.  Redoximorphic features in shades of black, gray, yellow, or brown range from none to common.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand."

The average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 55 inches and the average annual air temperature ranges from 72 to 74 degrees F."

Astor soils are on similar positions and are Mollisols.  The very poorly or poorly drained Basinger soils are on similar to higher positions and have weakly expressed spodic horizons.  The very poorly or poorly drained Immokalee and Myakka soils are on similar to higher positions and are Spodosols.  The excessively drained Paola and St. Lucie soils are on higher positions and are sandy throughout.  In addition, Paola soils have weakly expressed spodic horizons.  Placid soils are on similar positions but have umbric epipedons 10 to 24 inches in thickness.  The somewhat poorly to moderately well drained Pomello soils are on higher positions and are Spodosols."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nUmbric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 28 inches (A horizon).\nSellers soils are covered with water for 3 to 9 months, and the water table is at depths of less than 10 inches below the soil surface for 6 to 12 months during most years under natural conditions.  It may recede to depths of 20 to 40 inches during the drier seasons.  Flooding is likely under normal conditions.\nSellers soils were formerly included in the Rutlege series.  This description removes from the Rutlege series soils that have a mean annual soil temperature of more than 72 degrees F. at depths of 20 inches and a very dark gray to black A horizon 24 to 40 inches thick.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
