  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to hard bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to secondary carbonates ranges from 4 to 12 inches.  A thin coating of secondary calcium carbonate is on the bedrock and commonly seals some fractures.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the A and Bt horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is clay loam with a clay content from 27 to 35 percent.  Reaction ranges from neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is clay loam or clay with a clay content of 35 to 50 percent.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is clay loam or clay with a clay content of 35 to 50 percent.  It is calcareous and moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate in the form of masses, threads and concretions range from few to common.\nThe BCk horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is gravelly silt loam, gravelly silty clay loam or gravelly clay loam.  Masses and concretions of calcium carbonate make up 40 to 70 percent by volume.  Coarse fragments range from 10 to 20 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.  Coarse fragments are coated with calcium carbonate.  Calcium carbonate in the form of masses, threads and concretions range from common to many.\nThe R layer is fractured and layered limestone which is grayish or brownish in color and has a hardness of greater than 3 on the Moh's scale."

Similar soils are the Lindale, Lindy, Mingo, and Speck series.  Bexar and Rowden soils do not have a calcic horizon.  Frankirk, Lawton, Luckenbach, and Sagerton soils have sola more than 60 inches thick.  Lindale and Lindy soils have ochric epipedons.  Mingo soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick.  Speck soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Swenson soils are on broad ridgetop divides with convex to plain surfaces.  Slope gradients are 0 to 2 percent.  The regolith is loamy and clayey materials deposited over fractured beds of indurated limestone of the Permian System.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 25 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 68 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 210 to 230 days, and elevation ranges from 1,350 to 1,700 feet.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 32 to 44."

Leeray, Nukrum, and Nuvalde soils do not have an argillic horizon.  Sagerton soils have sola thicker than 60 inches.  These soils occur at lower elevations in nearby deep valley fills or outwash sediments.  Lueders, Palopinto, and Purves soils do not have an argillic horizon and are shallow to limestone.  They occur on similar or lower positions.  Throck soils formed in weathered shale that has clay texture and clayey materials at lower elevations."
