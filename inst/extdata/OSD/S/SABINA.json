These soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess and in the underlying till. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 12 degrees C (48 to 54 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1085 mm (32 to 43 inches), frost free period ranges from 160 to 200 days, and elevation ranges from 180 to 275 meters (590 to 9,02 feet) above mean sea level."

Flanagan soils have a mollic epipedon. Sunbury soils have a thin, dark colored surface layer."
