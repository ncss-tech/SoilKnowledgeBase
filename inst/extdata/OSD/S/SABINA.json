  "OVERVIEW": "The Sabina series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess and the underlying till.  These soils have moderately slow permeability.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 950 mm (37 inches).",
