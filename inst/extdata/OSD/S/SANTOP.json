These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days following the summer solstice.  Depth to bedrock ranged from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the solum and volcanic ash influence is 10 to 18 inches, and has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.40 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 65 percent rock fragments and 5 to 15 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has values of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has values of 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly ashy sandy loam or very cobbly ashy sandy loam.  It has 25 to 35 percent gravel and 5 to 15 percent cobbles.\nThe 2C horizon has values of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, very cobbly sandy loam or very stony sandy loam.  It has 25 to 40 percent gravel, 5 to 15 percent cobbles and 0 to 20 percent stones."

Brevco (T) soils have coarse sandy loam textures in the C horizon.  Coxit, Jimbluff, Lekrem, and Ontrail soils are very deep.  Highhorn soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are 40 to 60 inches to bedrock.   Huntrock soils have 27 to 35 percent clay and 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Kamela have a Bw horizon with 18 to 27 percent clay.  Redpeak soils have 2.5YR and 5YR hue.  Longort soils are moderately deep to densic material.  Jumpe soils are very deep.  Radercreek soils are deep to a lithic contact.  Seeburg soils are very deep.  Thout soils have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y and 5Y in the subsoil and have developed over andesite."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Santop soils are on backslopes and shoulders of mountains.  Elevation ranges from 2,600 to 5,100 feet.  Slopes are 35 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium with a minor amount of glacial till from sedimentary and volcanic rock and a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 20 to 24 inches.  The mean January temperature is 23 degrees F, the mean July temperature is 65 degrees F, and the mean annual temperatures is 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
