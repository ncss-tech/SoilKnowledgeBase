  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Skelon soils are on fan piedmonts and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  These soils are formed in mixed alluvium primarily from limestone, basalt, shale and quartzite.  Elevations are 2,300 to 5,000 feet.  The climate is arid with cool winters and hot summers.  Precipitation comes mostly as fall and winter rain.  Average annual precipitation is between 3 and 8 inches.  Average annual temperature is between 58 and 63 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 210 days."
