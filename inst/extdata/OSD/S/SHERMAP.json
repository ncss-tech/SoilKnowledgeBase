  "OVERVIEW": "The Shermap series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, landslide deposits, and eolian deposits derived from sandstone and shale. Shermap soils are on hills, structural benches, mountain slopes and landslides. Slopes are 2 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
