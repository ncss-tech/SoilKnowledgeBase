The particle-size control section averages less than 35 percent clay and more than 35 percent rock fragments. Aquic conditions are present at sometime in most years between 12 and 18 inches. The soil reaction is slightly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry. It is ashy silt loam with 20 to 27 percent clay. It has few to common, distinct or prominent redoximorphic concentrations.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 to 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. The upper part of the Bw horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay and has 0 to 5 percent gravel. The lower part is gravelly silt loam, cobbly silty clay loam, or very cobbly silty clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay and has 0 to 25 percent cobbles and 10 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe 2Bt horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist and dry, and chroma of 2 to 6 moist, 2 to 4 dry. It is very gravelly clay or very cobbly clay with 15 to 35 percent cobbles, 15 to 30 percent gravel, and 40 to 50 percent clay."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sherod soils are in narrow drainageways dissecting forested plateaus or benches and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent. Elevation is 3,400 to 4,500 feet. The soils formed in reworked loess and volcanic ash overlying clayey residuum derived from basalt. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 17 to 40 inches. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."

Cowsly soils are on plateaus, moderately well drained, and are greater than 40 inches to bedrock. Howmeadows soils are in drainageways, are in the fine family, and are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock. Tamarackcanyon, Threebuck, and Tolo soils are on north-facing hill sides. Tamarackcanyon soils are clayey-skeletal and 20 to 40 inches to bedrock. Threebuck soils are medial over clayey-skeletal and 40 to 60 inches to bedrock. Tolo soils are ashy over loamy and greater than 60 inches to bedrock. Wilkins soils are in broad meadows, are greater than 60 inches to bedrock, and have an albic horizon."
