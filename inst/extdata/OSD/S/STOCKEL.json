  "OVERVIEW": "The Stockel series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium.  Stockel soils are on footslopes and in swales and narrow drainageways dissecting old alluvial terraces and have slopes of 3 to 12 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",
