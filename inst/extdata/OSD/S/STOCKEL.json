  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist, but is dry throughout the control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the summer.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F.  Depth to a nonconforming clay horizon is 40 to 60 inches.  This horizon is absent in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam, gravelly loam or gravelly sandy loam and has 18 to 27 percent clay.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 25 percent gravel.  Clay films are faint to distinct.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 moist or dry and chromas of 2 or 3 moist and 7 or 8 dry.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent gravel.  It is 50 to 65 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stockel soils are in dissected drainageways on footslopes and in swale positions.  Elevations are 400 to 1,500 feet.  Slopes are 3 to 12 percent.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium derived predominantly from sandstone and siltstone.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and dry warm summers.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches.  The frost-free season is 160 to 235 days."

Bateman soils average more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are well drained.  Speaker soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact and are well drained.  Sutherlin is moderately well drained and the upper solum is silty clay loam or clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay and have contrasting textures within 40 inches.  Waldo soils have a mollic epipedon and are poorly drained."
