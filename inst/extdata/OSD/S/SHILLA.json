  "OVERVIEW": "The Shilla series consists of deep, well drained soils on hillsides and summits.  They formed in volcanic ash over material weathered from basalt.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 28 inches.",
