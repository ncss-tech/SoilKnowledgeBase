    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 35 to 54 inches.\nThe soil is strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon and in the upper part of the B horizon.  It is medium acid to neutral throughout the rest of the profile.  The base saturation is 50 percent or more in the A horizon and 60 percent or more throughout the rest of the profile.  Content of silt in the particle size control section is less than 20 percent.\nThe A1 or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or netural, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1.  The A2 horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or neutral, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1.  The A horizon is fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand.\nThe B1g horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1.  It is fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe B2tg horizon has hue of 10YR or netural, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1.  The higher values commonly are in the lower part of the B2tg horizon.  Few to common yellowish or reddish mottles or concretions are throughout the B horizon in most pedons.  The B2tg horizon commonly is sandy clay loam but includes sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe B3 horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is fine sand or loamy fine sand."
