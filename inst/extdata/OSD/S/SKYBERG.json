Based on MLRA correlation, the drainage class of Skyberg series is changed to poorly drained and the drainage class of Oran series remains somewhat poorly drained.  Depending on landscape position, much of what was mapped Skyberg in the past may be correlated as Oran in the future.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
