  "OVERVIEW": "The Skyberg series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in 25 to 75 centimeters of silty and loamy sediments and the underlying glacial till.  These soils are on linear and concave slopes on dissected till plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 785 millimeters.",

Based on MLRA correlation, the drainage class of Skyberg series is changed to poorly drained and the drainage class of Oran series remains somewhat poorly drained.  Depending on landscape position, much of what was mapped Skyberg in the past may be correlated as Oran in the future.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006."
