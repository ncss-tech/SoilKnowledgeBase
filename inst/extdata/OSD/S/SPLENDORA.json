  "OVERVIEW": "The Splendora series consists of very deep, moderately well to somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of Pleistocene age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1350 mm (53 in).",
