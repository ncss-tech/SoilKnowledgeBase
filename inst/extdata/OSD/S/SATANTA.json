  "OVERVIEW": "The Satanta series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits. These soils are on sand sheets on paleoterraces of tablelands in the Central High Tableland (MLRA 72). Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C. (55 degrees F.) and mean annual precipitation is 48 centimeters (19 inches) at the type location.",
