Schoolcraft soils formed in loamy material over sand or gravelly sand. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 1016 mm (29 to 40 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 11.7 degrees C (46 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 170 days. Elevation is 177 to 311 meters (580 to 1,020 feet) above mean sea level."
