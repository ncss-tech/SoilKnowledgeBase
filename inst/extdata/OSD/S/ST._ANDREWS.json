Delrio soils are in outwash channels, depressions, swales, and on side slopes of glaciated plateaus. DelRio soils are ashy and do not have duripan. Simsfield soils are in glaciolacustrine bottoms and small depressions. Stubblefield soils are on ground moraines and are loamy-skeletal. Touhey soils are on side slopes and toe slopes of undulating till plains on plateaus."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this pedon are a mollic epipedon from the surface to 14 inches, a fine-loamy argillic horizon with an average of 12.5 percent pebbles and 9 percent fine sand through very coarse sand (by weight) and with 1 percent calcium carbonate equivalent from 14 to 29 inches, and a moderately cemented lime-silica duripan from 29 to 33 inches over dense till. The particle size control section in the zone from 14 to 29 inches (the 2Btk1 and 2Btk2 horizons). Placement into fine-loamy family based on 2.5 x 15-bar water for average clay of 20 percent. The pumice is white, gray or yellowish brown. The percent field estimated pebbles by volume in the 2Btk horizons was not converted to percent by weight and is not listed on the lab data for this pedon, NSSL #90P0334. The gravel consists of ice rafted erratics and till rock fragments.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Partial NSSL lab data is available on this pedon, #90P0334.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
