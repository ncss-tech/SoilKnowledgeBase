The particle size control section in the zone from 14 to 29 inches (the 2Btk1 and 2Btk2 horizons). Placement into fine-loamy family based on 2.5 x 15-bar water for average clay of 20 percent. The pumice is white, gray or yellowish brown. The percent field estimated pebbles by volume in the 2Btk horizons was not converted to percent by weight and is not listed on the lab data for this pedon, NSSL #90P0334.
