  "OVERVIEW": "The Shadilto series consists of very shallow and shallow to limestone, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian material over residuum derived from sandstone and limestone. Shadilto soils are on dip slopes of cuestas. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
