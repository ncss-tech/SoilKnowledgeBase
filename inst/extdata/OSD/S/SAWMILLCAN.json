These soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from limestone and dolomitic limestone. Elevations are 2,150 to 2,920 meters (7,050 to 9,580 feet). The climate is sub-humid continental, cool, with moist winters and common summer convection storms. The mean annual precipitation is 320 to 420 millimeters ; mean annual air temperature is 10 to 14 degrees C., and the frost-free season 100 to 150 days."
