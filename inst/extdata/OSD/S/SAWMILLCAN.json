  "OVERVIEW": "The Sawmillcan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from limestone and dolomitic limestone. The Sawmillcan soils are on backslopes and footslopes of mountains. Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 355 millimeters (14 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C. (54 degrees F.)",
