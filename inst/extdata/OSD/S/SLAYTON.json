  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Slayton soils are usually dry for 90 to 150 cumulative days.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section has less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Channery fragments and pebbles in the soil range from 15 to 35 percent.  Sand-size ash ranges from 5 to 30 percent.  The solum has 5 to 30 percent glass, phosphate retention of 15 to 25 percent and acid oxalate iron plus one-half the acid oxalate aluminum of 0.4 to 0.8 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist.  It has weak thin platy and weak fine granular structure or is single grained.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has weak medium to coarse subangular blocky structure.  It is channery or gravelly fine sandy loam or sandy loam with 15 to 35 percent rock fragments."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Calzacorta, Starbuck and Trevino series.  All of these soils lack the ashy soil properties. Calzacorta soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section, lack channery fragments and are underlain by basalt.  Starbuck soils are medium textured, lack channery fragments and formed in mixed loess, colluvium, and alluvium basalt origin and overlie basalt.  Trevino soils are medium textured, are 8 to 18 inches deep to carbonates, lack channery fragments and are underlain by basalt."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from tuff or breccia mixed with volcanic ash.  Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Summers are warm and dry with an average summer temperature of 61 to 63 degrees F.  Winters are cool and moist with an average winter temperature of 32 to 34 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."
