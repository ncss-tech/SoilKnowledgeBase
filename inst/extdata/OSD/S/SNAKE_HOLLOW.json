  "OVERVIEW": "Snake Hollow series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils  on outwash fans at elevations of 5,600 to 6,800 feet. Slope gradients are 3 to 20 percent. These soils formed in deep alluvium from coarse-grained acid and intermediate igneous rocks. Mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 13 inches.",

Burch soils have a MAST of 50 to 55 degrees F, are noncalcareous and have control section textures dominated by loam, silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Calpine soils are moderately acid to neutral, do not have carbonates and are 30 to 50 inches to the base of the cambic horizon. Cashmere soils are not intermittently moist in summer due to convection storms and are not calcareous in the control section. Cashmont soils are not intermittently moist in summer due to convection storms and are not calcareous in the control section.. Rio King soils are not intermittently moist in summer due to convection storms and are influenced by volcanic ash. Roloff and Roosevelt soils are moderately deep over bedrock."
