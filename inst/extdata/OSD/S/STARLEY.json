  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to hard bedrock and lithic contact ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick.  Organic carbon content of the epipedon ranges from 1 to 3 percent.  The matrix texture of the particle size control section is loam or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 50 percent silt, and 20 to 50 percent sand with more than 15 percent but less than 35 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Rock fragments in the control section range from 35 to 70 percent and consist mainly of angular fragments from 3 to 10 inches in diameter. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 35 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 40 to 53 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Rock fragments range from 20 to 40 percent.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk or C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Rock fragments range from 30 to 70 percent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth fraction ranges from 4 to 14 percent.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline."

Arrowpeak, Chokecherry, Clamp (T), Dalys, Dollarhide, Eyre, Irigul, Irson, Jonlake, Labshaft, Milling, Poin, Rogert, Schwacheim, Topeki, and Udel soils lack accumulations of calcium carbonate. Cheedle soils have more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand throughout. Chokecherry, Dollarhide, Milling, Poin, Rogert and Udel soils also have less than 18 percent clay throughout.  None of these soils formed in materials weathered from limestone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Starley soils are on hillslopes, ridges, and mountain slopes.  They formed in residuum and colluvial slopewash derived from limestone.  Slopes are 0 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 5,500 to 9,800 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 15 to 30 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 30 to 42 degrees F. The frost-free period is 30 to 90 days depending upon aspect, elevation, and local air drainage."

Nathrop and Woosley soils are moderately deep to limestone and have argillic horizons.  Redmanson soils are deep and have over 40 percent calcium carbonate throughout.  These soils occur on toeslope positions."
