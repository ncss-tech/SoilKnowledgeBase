  "OVERVIEW": "The Shoestring series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in layers of aerially deposited volcanic ash and pumice over pyroclastic flows and lahars.  They are on terraces and terrace escarpments at elevations of 2,700 to 4,500 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 130 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

Shoestring soils formed in layers of aerially deposited volcanic ash and pumice over pyroclastic flows and lahars.  Beginning from the surface of the mineral soils the stratigraphy of pyroclastic material represented in a typical profile includes:  (1) fresh ash from the 176-year-old \"Layer T\", (2) pumice from the 400-year-old \"Layer W\", (3) ash, pumice and scoria from the 2,500-year-old \"B set\", (4) pyroclastic flows or lahars.  The climate is characterized by cool, moist summers, and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 120 to 140 inches including snow cover from November to June. The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F., the average July temperature is about 53 degrees F., and the average annual temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F.

The 5 to 8 inch zone (2Bs1 horizon) fails to meet the color requirement for a spodic horizon.\nAndic soil properties - zone from 0 to 18 inches.\nParticle-size control sectin - the zone from 10 to 40 inches with 10 to 18 inches qualifying as medial, and 18 to 40 inches qualifying as sandy or sandy-skeletal.\nClassification changed 6/98 reflecting revision in mineralogy classes in Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
