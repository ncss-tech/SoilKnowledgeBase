Iron stains on pumice fragments have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6.\nThe 3Bs horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Shoestring soils are on terraces, terrace escarpments and toe slopes of Mount St. Helens at elevations of 2,700 to 4,500 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  Shoestring soils formed in layers of aerially deposited volcanic ash and pumice over pyroclastic flows and lahars.  Beginning from the surface of the mineral soils the stratigraphy of pyroclastic material represented in a typical profile includes:  (1) fresh ash from the 176-year-old \"Layer T\", (2) pumice from the 400-year-old \"Layer W\", (3) ash, pumice and scoria from the 2,500-year-old \"B set\", (4) pyroclastic flows or lahars.  The climate is characterized by cool, moist summers, and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 120 to 140 inches including snow cover from November to June. The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F., the average July temperature is about 53 degrees F., and the average annual temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F.  The frost- free season in 70 to 90 days."
