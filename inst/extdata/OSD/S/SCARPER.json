  "OVERVIEW": "The Scarper series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from quartz diorite.  These soils are on uplands and have slopes of 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is 54 to 56 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 56 to 58 degrees F and is usually not below 47 degrees F at any time.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 14 to 20 inches.\nThe difference between mean winter and mean summer soil temperature is less than 9 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is moist throughout the solum from mid-November through June.  It is dry in some or all parts the rest of the time but is not dry in all parts for 45 consecutive days.  Rock fragments throughout the profile range from 15 to 25 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid to moderately acid.  Organic carbon is 3 to 4 percent throughout.  The clay content is 8 to 18 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/2, 4/1, 4/2, 5/1, 5/2, or 5/3 dry and 10YR 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, or 4/3 moist.  Textures are gravelly coarse sandy loams.\nThe C horizon is 7.5YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3; 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, or 5/3 dry and 7.5YR 3/2; 10YR 3/2 or 4/3 moist.  Texture is gravelly coarse sandy loam.  This horizon does not meet the requirements for a mollic epipedon."
