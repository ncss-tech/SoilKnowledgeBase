  "OVERVIEW": "The Silentcone series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic tephra. Silentcone soils are on basalt plains associated with recent lava flows. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The permeability is moderate. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
