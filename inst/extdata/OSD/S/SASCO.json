The alluvium is derived from acid and basic igneous rocks which are mainly granite, schist, rhyolite, andesite, and quartzite.  Elevations are 1100 to 2000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 10 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 72 to 75 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 240 to 350 days."
