  "OVERVIEW": "The Smileytank series consists of very shallow or shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from dolomite, dolomitic limestone, or interbedded sedimentary formations.  Smileytank soils are on hillslopes and ridges of structural benches. Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
