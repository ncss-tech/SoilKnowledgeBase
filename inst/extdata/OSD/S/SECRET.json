  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: They somewhat resemble Adelaide, Ebbs, Lieberman, Penoyer, and Tandy soils.  Adelaide soils are pale, loamy Regosols of C-C alk - Cca profile sequence which are generally deeper than Secret soils and are generally less calcareous in the surface horizon.  They are derived from mixed rock sources.  Ebbs soils are pale to light brown, strongly calcareous loams which differ from Secret soils in being hard and very deep.  They occur on recent alluvial fans of mixed origin.   Lieberman soils are loamy Regosols in the Sierozem soil zone.  They are highly calcareous, very deep except for areas of alkali pan or lime cementation, and are developed from dominantly basaltic rock sources.  Penoyer soils are very deep, pale, highly calcareous fine sandy loams which have developed from mixed Lahontan age sediments.  Tandy soils are Regosols of fine sandy loam texture which differ in being generally deeper, imperfectly drained, somewhat darker (10YR 5/1 to 6/2 dry colors) throughout solum, and are developed on shell enriched beach sands."

Gently sloping but undulating on dissected terraces.  Strongly sloping to steep concave slopes on escarpments which are capped by rimrock."
