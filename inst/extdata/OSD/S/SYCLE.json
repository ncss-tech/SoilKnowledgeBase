Depth to carbonates ranges from 10 to 30 inches but may be calcareous to the surface in some pedons.  The moisture control section is dry for 15 consecutive days from May 15 to July 15 when the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F. (5 degrees C.).  It is not dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice to October 20 and for at least 90 cumulative days during that period.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy clay loam or light clay loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Clay content ranges from 20 to 35 percent.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is gravelly sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon is calcareous mixed sand, cobble, and gravel."

Elevation is 6,000 to 7,000 feet.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature ranges from 60 to 68 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 19 inches and is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year with about half of the precipitation falling between April and September.  May and June are the driest months.  PE Index is about 50 at the type location and ranges from 30 to 60 for the series."
