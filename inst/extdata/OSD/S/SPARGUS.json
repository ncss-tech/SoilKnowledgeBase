  "OVERVIEW": "The Spargus series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a mixture of water worked colluvium and old alluvium on alluvial fans. Slope ranges from 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
