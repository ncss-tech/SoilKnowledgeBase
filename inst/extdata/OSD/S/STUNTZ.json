They are very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe glossic horizon has an E/B or B/E or both.  The Bt and E parts each occupy 15 percent or more.  Colors and textures are similar to the E and Bt horizons respectively.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and dominant chroma of 3 or 4.  It has clay films or coatings with chroma of 2 on faces of peds.  It is clay loam, sandy clay loam or loam with clay content ranging from 20 to 35 percent.
