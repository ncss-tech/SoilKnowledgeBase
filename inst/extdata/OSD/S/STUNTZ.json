  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Free carbonates begin at depths between 30 and 60 inches.  The till has 2 to 12 percent by volume of rock fragments of mixed lithology, but typically high in gray, soft flat shale and 0 to 2 percent cobblestones.  The A and E horizons have  0 to 5 percent by volume of rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1, or is neutral with value of 2.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The A and E horizons are very fine sandy loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  They are very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe glossic horizon has an E/B or B/E or both.  The Bt and E parts each occupy 15 percent or more.  Colors and textures are similar to the E and Bt horizons respectively.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and dominant chroma of 3 or 4.  It has clay films or coatings with chroma of 2 on faces of peds.  It is clay loam, sandy clay loam or loam with clay content ranging from 20 to 35 percent.  The sand content ranges from 25 to 45 percent.  It is strongly acid to slightly alkaline.  The bulk density ranges from 1.5 to 1.7 gm/cc.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4 with bright colored Fe concentrations in many pedons.  It is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Most pedons have calcium carbonate equivalent of 5 to 15 percent.  The bulk density ranges from 1.5 to 1.7 gm/cc.  The sand content ranges from 25 to 45 percent."

They formed in calcareous loamy till of late Wisconsinan glaciation.  Mean annual air temperature is 36 to 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 22 to 30 inches.  Frost-free days range from 88 to 135.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 1000 to 1600 feet."
