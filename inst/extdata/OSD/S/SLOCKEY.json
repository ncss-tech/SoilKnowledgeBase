  "OVERVIEW": "The Slockey series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuff.  Slockey soils are on rock pediments, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
