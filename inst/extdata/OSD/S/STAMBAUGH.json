  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness and depth to sandy material ranges from 24 to 40 inches. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the solum, and from 25 to 60 percent in the substratum. The content of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the solum and from 0 to 10 percent in the substratum. Stones covering the surface range from less than 0.01 to 0.1 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1.  Cultivated areas have Ap horizons with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. The A or Ap horizons are silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have E horizons below the A horizon, with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid. In cultivated areas the upper 4 to 8 inches of the E horizon is mixed into the Ap horizon.\nSome pedons have Bhs horizons with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 3. They are silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bs1 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 4. The Bs2 horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. The Bs horizons are silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.  This horizon is firm in place but does not have characteristics of a fragipan.\nThe E portion of the E/B or B/E horizon has characteristics the same as the E horizon.\nThe B portion of the E/B or B/E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4. The solum is less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser and less than 18 percent clay.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is gravelly sand or very gravelly sand. Thin layers of coarse sand or sand are in some pedons. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Similar or related soils include the Amasa, Bohemian, Champion, Fence, Goodman, Newaygo, Oconto, Pence, Padus, and Wabeno series. Amasa and Pence soils do not have argillic horizons.  Bohemian and Fence soils have silty material below 40 inches.  Champion, Goodman and Wabeno soils are underlain by glacial till containing more than 12 percent clay and less than 70 percent sand and contain more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the solum.  In addition, Champion and Wabeno soils have fragipans. Newaygo soils are underlain by calcareous gravelly sand.  Oconto soils do not have spodic horizons and have solums which contain more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. Padus soils contain more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the solum."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and properties recognized in this pedon are ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 4 inches (A horizon); spodic horizon - the zone from 4 to 18 inches (Bs and Bs2 horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from 22 to 39 inches (B part of B/E horizon). The silty eolian mantle has been modified by windthrow action and post glacial erosion.\nThe moderately well drained phase of the series is no longer within the series concept.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Record No.: MI0085; STONY PHASE - MI0640.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
