  "OVERVIEW": "The Slipback series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks. The Slipback soils are on fan piedmont remnants and mountain valley fans. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
