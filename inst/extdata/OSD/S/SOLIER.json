  "STATES": "LA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Solier series consists of deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in late Pleistocene age loess or silty alluvium mantled by a thin layer of clayey alluvium. These soils are on broad low terraces of the Red River that are at flood plain elevations. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.",

The Bowdre, Earle, Hebert, Kurk, McGehee, Latanier, Newellton, Sonnier and Tunica series are in closely related families. Acy, Essen, Hebert, and Frozard soils are loamy throughout and do not have a discontinuity. Kurk soils are loamy throughout. McGehee soils are loamy throughout the upper part of the solum. Bowdre and Sonnier soils have a mollic epipedon. Latanier soils are vertisols and do not have an argillic horizon.  Bowdre, Earle, Newellton, and Tunica soils have grayer hue in the clayey layers above the discontinuity and do not have an argillic horizon."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series classification was updated from a clayey over fine-silty Aeric Haplaquept to a clayey over fine-silty Aeric Epiaquept in 2001. It was changed again to a fine-silty Aeric Epiaqualf in 2002.  The former classification was based on the overlying cambic horizon that was separated from the underlying argillic horizon by an albic horizon.  Current taxonomy stipulates that the classification must recognize the argillic horizon however, unless it is overlain by a layer of new material at least 3 inches thick that fails criteria for all diagnostic horizons.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the type location pedon include:\nOchric epipedon---------------0 to 6 inches (Ap horizon)\nCambic horizon----------------6 to 19 inches (Bg and Bw horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity------19 inches (top of the 2Eg horizon)\nAlbic horizon-----------------19 to 25 inches (2E horizon)\nIntrusions of albic material--25 to 42 inches (2Btg/E horizon)\nArgillic horizon--------------25 to 77 inches (2Btg/E and Btg horizons)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
