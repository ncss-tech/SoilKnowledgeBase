  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Acy, Essen, and Frozard series in the same family. The Bowdre, Earle, Hebert, Kurk, McGehee, Latanier, Newellton, Sonnier and Tunica series are in closely related families. Acy, Essen, Hebert, and Frozard soils are loamy throughout and do not have a discontinuity. Kurk soils are loamy throughout. McGehee soils are loamy throughout the upper part of the solum. Bowdre and Sonnier soils have a mollic epipedon. Latanier soils are vertisols and do not have an argillic horizon.  Bowdre, Earle, Newellton, and Tunica soils have grayer hue in the clayey layers above the discontinuity and do not have an argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Solier soils are on nearly level, low terraces of late Pleistocene age on the Red River alluvial plain that are at flood plain elevations. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. These soils formed in loess or silty alluvium overlain by clayey alluvium. The mean annual temperature is 66 degrees F, and the mean annual rainfall is about 61 inches near the type location."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series classification was updated from a clayey over fine-silty Aeric Haplaquept to a clayey over fine-silty Aeric Epiaquept in 2001. It was changed again to a fine-silty Aeric Epiaqualf in 2002.  The former classification was based on the overlying cambic horizon that was separated from the underlying argillic horizon by an albic horizon.  Current taxonomy stipulates that the classification must recognize the argillic horizon however, unless it is overlain by a layer of new material at least 3 inches thick that fails criteria for all diagnostic horizons.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the type location pedon include:\nOchric epipedon---------------0 to 6 inches (Ap horizon)\nCambic horizon----------------6 to 19 inches (Bg and Bw horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity------19 inches (top of the 2Eg horizon)\nAlbic horizon-----------------19 to 25 inches (2E horizon)\nIntrusions of albic material--25 to 42 inches (2Btg/E horizon)\nArgillic horizon--------------25 to 77 inches (2Btg/E and Btg horizons)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
