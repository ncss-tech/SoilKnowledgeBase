These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days after the summer solstice. Thickness of the volcanic ash mantle is 7 to 14 inches and it has estimated moist bulk density of 0.85 to 1.10 g/cc, glass content of 5 to 30 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, phosphorus retention is 25 to 40 percent and the 15 bar water retention is 8 to 12 percent for air dried samples. Depth to skeletal material is 14 to 22 inches. The particle-size control section has 45 to 65 percent rock fragments and up to 5 percent soft tuffaceous sandstone fragments and 4 to 7 percent clay. Solum thickness is 50 or more inches.\nThe A horizon has a value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 dry, 2 or 3 moist.\nThe 2Bw horizon has a hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 7 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry, 2 to 4 moist. Texture is gravelly sandy loam in the 2Bw1 horizon and very gravelly sandy loam or extremely gravelly sandy loam in the 2Bw2 horizon.

The Highborn and Radarcreek soils are deep to a lithic contact. Coxit soils have 8 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Jimbluff soils have an ashy loamy sand ash mantle 10 to 20 inches thick. Jumpe soils have an ashy mantle 24 to 45 inches thick and have 15 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Lekrem soils have an ashy mantle 12 to 25 inches thick. Ontrail soils have a hue of 7.5YR or 5YR throughout the profile."
