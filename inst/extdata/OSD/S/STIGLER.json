The thickness of the combined A horizons ranges from 16 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.  Base saturation is less than 50 percent.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture and reaction are similar to the A1 horizon.  The boundary between the E horizon and Bt1 horizon is wavy or irregular.  Base saturation is less than 50 percent.\nSome pedons have an AB horizon or BA horizon that ranges from 3 to 6 inches thick.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  The Bt1 horizon ranges from medium acid to very strongly acid.  It is mottled in shades of gray, brown, yellow, and red.\nThe Bt2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 8 or is coarsely mottled in shades of gray, yellow, brown, or red.  It has textures similar to the Bt1 horizon. Reaction ranges from mildly alkaline to strongly acid.\nThe BC horizon is similar to the Bt2 horizon in color, texture, and reaction.  The exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 4 to 16."

Angie, Shuster, Tiak, and Tuskegee soils have less than 35 percent base saturation.  Bosville and Counts soils have an abrupt textural change between the E horizon and the Bt horizon, and the combined thickness of the A horizons are less than 16 inches.  Boxwell and Gore soils have a COLE OF 0.09 or more.  Boxville and Braxton soils lack chroma 2 mottles within 30 inches of the surface.  Choteau, Dennis, and Okemah soils have a mollic epipedon.  Grubbs, Sobol, and Tupelo soils have sola less than 60 inches thick.  Huntsburg soils have more than 5 percent plinthite by volume in all subhorizons within 60 inches of the surface.

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stigler soils are on nearly level to gently sloping uplands in the valleys of the Ouachita Mountains and the Arkansas Valley and Ridges.  They formed in loamy and clayey colluvium or alluvium over interbedded shale and sandstone.  The shale and sandstone is of Pennsylvanian age.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 46 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 64 degrees F. Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 64 to 74."
