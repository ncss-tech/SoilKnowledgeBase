    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Shakamak soils are on loess-covered till plains of Illinoian age. Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. The soils formed in 127 to 165 cm (50 to 65 inches) of loess and in the underlying paleosol in till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 965 to 1092 mm (38 to 43 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 13 degrees C (52 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 170 to 200 days.
