  "OVERVIEW": "The Shakamak series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are moderately deep to a fragipan. The Shakamak soils formed in loess and in the underlying paleosol in till. They are on till plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
