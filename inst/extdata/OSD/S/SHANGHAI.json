The difference between average July and average January soil temperature is 30 degrees to 33 degrees F.\nThe 10 to 40 inches control section  is stratified layers of silt loam to fine sandy loam and silty clay loam, but is dominantly silt loam with less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Clay content ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  Content of organic matter decreases irregularly with depth.  Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 7/4, 7/3, 6/4, 6/3, 5/4; 2.5Y 6/2 or 7/2 and moist color of 10YR 4/4, 4/3; 2.5Y 4/2, 3/2 or 3/3 with mottled colors dry and moist of 10YR 4/6, 5/6, 5/8; 7.5YR 5/6, 7/6 and 5YR 6/8.
