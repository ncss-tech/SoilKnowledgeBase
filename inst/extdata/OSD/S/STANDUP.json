The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days during summer and fall.  The upper 3 to 7 inches of the pedon is dominated by volcanic ash in the fine earth fraction.  The control section averages l0 to l5 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has a value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry.  It has 35 to 45 percent pebbles.\nThe B horizon has a value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 2 or 3 dry.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, very cobbly sandy loam, or extremely cobbly sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has a value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist, 2 or 3 dry.  It is extremely cobbly sandy loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, or very gravelly sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid."
