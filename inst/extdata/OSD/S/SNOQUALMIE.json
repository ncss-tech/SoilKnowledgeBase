  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Snoqualmie series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in alluvium on low river terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 65 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 40 to 785 percent rounded rock fragments.  The upper 40 inches of the pedon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist, 0 to 2 dry.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral throughout."

Netrac soils have a volcanic ash surface layer that is 7 to 14 inches thick.  Wiseman soils are 40 to 80 percent phyllite channers in the particle-size control section."

The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 90 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 43 degrees F; the mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."

Greenwater and Pilchuck soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Lemolo soils are loamy-skeletal and have an aquic moisture regime.  Klaus soils have a spodic horizon."
