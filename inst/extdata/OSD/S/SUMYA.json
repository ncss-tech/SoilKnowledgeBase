  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sumya series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite and breccias.  Sumya soils are on side slopes of mountains. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
