Crookston soils are 20 to 28 inches to secondary carbonates and average annual soil temperature less than 52 degrees F.  Newell and Roystone soils are not cobbly in the lower part of the argillic horizon and lack a lithologic discontinuities in their argillic horizons.  Peola soils contain durinodes and are moderately deep to a lithic contact."
