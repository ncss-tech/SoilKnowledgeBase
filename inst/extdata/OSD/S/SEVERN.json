It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam and is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5 YR, value of 4, 5, or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8 or hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8, or hue of 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.  It is stratified very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loamy very fine sand.  Within the control section, the cumulative thickness of layers containing more than 18 percent clay is less than 8 inches.\nBuried horizons are common below a depth of 24 inches.  Colors and textures are similar to the A and C horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Severn soils occur on level to gently undulating flood plains that carry sediments mainly from Permian Red Beds.  They formed in loamy and silty calcareous alluvium.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 52 inches.   Mean annual temperature ranges from 59 degrees to 65 degrees F.  The Thornthwaite annual P-E indices are 64 to 80.  They are rarely flooded in protected areas or commonly flooded for very brief or brief periods during January though October.  Average frost free days range from 210 to 240.  Elevation ranges from 100 to 800 feet."

The Choska, Coushatta, Idabel and Oklared soils are at similar elevations.  Kiomatia soils are in lower areas.  Redlake soils are further from the streams.  Roebuck soils are in back slough positions.  All of these soils have a cambic horizon except the Oklared series.  Coushatta soils contain more than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Idabel soils contain more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the control section.   Redlake and Roebuck soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  In addition, Roebuck soils have a mollic epipedon."
