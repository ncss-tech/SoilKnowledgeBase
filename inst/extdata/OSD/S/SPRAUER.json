    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. These soils are usually dry in the moisture control section for more than half the cumulative time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick. The solum above the duripan has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.35 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, including 15 to 30 percent pumiceous sand, 0.5 to 2.0 mm in diameter, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent, 15 percent or more fine sand or coarser, 0 to 10 percent rock fragments, and an apparent field estimated clay content of 5 to 14 percent. Depth to the indurated duripan is 20 to 40 inches. Basalt bedrock underlies the indurated duripan at depths of 30 to 60 inches.\nThe Ap horizon chroma is 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon is ashy fine sandy loam or ashy sandy loam. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon value is 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist. It is ashy fine sandy loam, ashy loam, or ashy silt loam. It has 1 to 8 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bkqm horizon value is 6 to 8 dry and 5 to 8 moist. The chroma is 1 to 3 dry and 2 to 4 moist. The indurated duripan is cemented with silica and calcium carbonate, it is 4 to 24 inches thick, and is fractured with average duripan plates measuring 4 to 14 inches in width and 1 to 4 inches in thickness."

The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. Average January air temperature is about 27 degrees F., average July air temperature is about 71 degrees F., and average annual air temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.

Deercut soils are on side slopes and toe slopes of uplands on plateaus and have an argillic horizon. Kester soils are on intermittent stream bottoms and side drainages and are moderately deep to basalt bedrock. Toler soils are on uplands and have an argillic horizon. Whiteye soils are on uplands and are shallow to thick indurated duripan."

The profile from the surface to 30 inches (duripan) has an estimated volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, including 20 to 25 percent sand-size ash 0.5 to 2.0 mm in size. The control section is the zone from 10 to 30 inches (part of the Bw, and the Bk horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: The calcium carbonate equivalent test done on the Bk horizon was run in the survey office using a standard calcimeter.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
