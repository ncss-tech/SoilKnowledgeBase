    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the loamy horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid and is moderately acid or slightly acid in some part of the 10 to 40 inch control section.\nThe A horizon has color value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand and in some places, loam.\nThe C horizon has color value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand.\nThe 2Cg horizon has color value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 to 3. Masses of iron have higher value and chroma. It typically is silt loam or silty clay loam, however, some pedons have thin strata of loam or sandy loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. Similar soils are the Floris, Klum and Nodaway series. Floris soils have more silt and clay in the upper part of the series control section. Klum soils have more silt and clay in the upper part of the series control section and have a darker colored surface layer. Nodaway soils are fine-silty."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sandover soils are on flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent and are adjacent to stream channels that have been straightened. These soils formed in mostly sandy over loamy alluvium.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 54 degrees and mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 35 inches."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
