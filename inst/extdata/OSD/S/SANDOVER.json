  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sandover series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in mostly sandy over loamy alluvium on flood plains. These soils have rapid permeability in the upper part and moderate permeability in the lower part. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 35 inches.",

Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid and is moderately acid or slightly acid in some part of the 10 to 40 inch control section.\nThe A horizon has color value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand and in some places, loam.\nThe C horizon has color value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand.\nThe 2Cg horizon has color value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 to 3. Masses of iron have higher value and chroma. It typically is silt loam or silty clay loam, however, some pedons have thin strata of loam or sandy loam."
