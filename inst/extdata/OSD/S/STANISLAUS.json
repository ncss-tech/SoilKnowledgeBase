    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil between a depth of 6 to 16 inches is moist throughout from about January 15 to June 1 and dry throughout from July 15 through November 15.  The soil temperature is warmer than 47 degrees F from January 15 to December 1.  The mean annual soil temperature is 62 degrees F.  The clay content of the A horizon ranges from 35 to 40 percent and the clay content of the Bt1 and Bt2 horizon ranges from 38 to 45 percent but is always less than 1.2 times more than the A horizon.  The Btk horizon ranges from 25 to 40 percent clay content.  Surface cracks range from 1 to 4 cm but are less than 1 cm wide within 20 inches of depth.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 2 percent but is less than 1 percent within 20 inches.  Disseminated lime may start at 25 inches of depth but all segregated lime is below 36 inches.  ESP is less than 8.\nThe A and AP horizon dry color is 10YR 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, or 5/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3.  It may have up to 10 percent gravel, 5 to 20 mm in diameter.  The EC is less than 2 mmhos/cm and the reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt1 and Bt2 horizon dry color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/3, 5/4, 5/6, or 6/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 4/6, or 5/4.  It is clay loam or clay .  It has moderate or strong subangular blocky structure.  The reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon dry color is 10YR 3/3, 4/3, 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6, 5/8 or 7.5YR 5/6.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/6, 4/3, 4/4, 4/6, 4/8, 5/3, 5/4 or 7.5YR 4/4.  Mottles, occurring only in the wet phase, are N 2/0, N 3/0; or 10YR 2/1.  Typically, it is loam or clay loam but may be clay in the upper part.  It is slightly or strongly effervescent but calcium carbonate equivalent is less than 15 percent.  The reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Deldota, Myers, Rincon, Sorrento, Stomar (T), Vernalis, and Woo series in other families.  Deldota soils develop wide cracks when dry and are somewhat poorly drained.  Myers soils have wide cracks and slickensides.  Rincon soils have a massive A horizon and an argillic horizon.  Sorrento, Vernalis, and Woo soils have a fine, loamy control section.  Stomar soils have an argillic horizon and an ochric epipedon."

They are on nearly level topography.  Elevations are 70 to 300 feet.  The climate is semiarid, with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F.; the mean January temperature is 79 degrees F.; and the mean July temperature is 79 degrees F.  The frost free season is 210 to 280 days."

Organic matter determined by Walkley-Black digestion method.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU. S. A."
