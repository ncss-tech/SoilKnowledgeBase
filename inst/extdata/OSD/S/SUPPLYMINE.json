Elevations range from 340 to 850 meters (1,115 to 2,788 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 365 days."

In addition, Blackeagle soils have a cambic horizon, Ironage soils have an argillic horizon and Bolero soils have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections. Dalelake soils have sandy particle-size control sections and are formed in eolian materials."
