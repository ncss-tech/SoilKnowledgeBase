  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Average annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F., and average summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 64 degrees F.  Depth to the lithic contact is 8 to 20 inches below the surface.  Bedrock is sandstone or siltstone.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent and are mainly subangular to channery in shape and are both pebble and cobble size.  Small breakable sandstone and siltstone chips are present in some pedons.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe A & BA horizons have hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is typically very gravelly sandy clay loam, very gravelly clay loam, or very gravelly sandy loam.  Clay content is 18 to 35 percent."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision updates the classification from a Borollic Lithic subgroup to be compatible with the 1994 Amendments to Soil Taxonomy.  Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this soil include an ochric epipedon from 0 to 5 inches; an argillic horizon from 5 to 9 inches; Cr horizon from 9 to 19 inches; a lithic contact at 19 inches; over 35 percent rock fragments in the texture control section; an ustic aridic moisture regime; and a frigid temperature regime.  Last updated by the state 8/95.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Lakewood MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
