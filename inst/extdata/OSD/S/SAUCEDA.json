The soils formed in residuum weathered from Mitchell Mesa Ignimbrite.   The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches.  Most precipitation occurs as high intensity rainfall during covectional afternoon thuderstorms form June through September.  The mean annual air temperature 60 to 67 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 200 to 250 days.  Elevation is 3,500 to 5,000 feet."
