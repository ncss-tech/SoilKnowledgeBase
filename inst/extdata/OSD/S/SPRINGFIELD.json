It is strongly acid or medium acid.\nThe E horizon is gray (10YR 5/1, 6/1), light gray (10YR 7/1, 7/2; 2.5Y 7/2), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2; 2.5Y 6/2), or grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam.  It is very strongly acid through medium acid.  The boundary between the A and B horizons is abrupt and wavy or smooth.\nThe Btg horizon is grayish brown (10YR 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2) or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2; 2.5Y 6/2) clay or silty clay with reddish brown or yellowish red mottles.  It is medium acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bt and BC horizons are yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6), pale brown (10YR 5/3), or light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4, 5/6) silty clay loam or silt loam with grayish and brownish mottles.  It is medium acid through moderately alkaline.  The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon has between 35 and 60 percent clay and 5 to 10 percent sand that is dominantly very fine."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Acadia and Patoutville soils lack an abrupt textural change.  Calhoun, Mamou, Patoutville, and Tenot soils have fine-silty textures.  Calhoun, Wrightsville, and Zachary soils have A2 horizons that tongue into argillic horizons.  Calhoun, Crowley, Wrightsville, and Zachary soils lack horizons with dominant chromas above 2."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on nearly level uplands or terraces in areas of very low relief.  Slope gradients range from about 0 to 2 percent.  The soil formed in late Pleistocene deposits of uncertain origin; they are very low in sand and have many characteristics of loess.  The average temperature at the type location is 52 degrees F, in January and 81 degrees F, in July.  Average annual precipitation is 58 inches."
