  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Shima soils are in fresh water marshes and river channels of the San Joaquin-Sacramento Delta.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.  They formed in hydrophytic plant remains and mixed mineral alluvium.  The organic material is derived from tule and reed fibers.  Elevations are 1.5 above to 4.9 meters below sea level (5 feet above to 15 feet below sea level) and are on islands protected by levees.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 356 to 406 millimeters (14 to 16 inches).  The mean January temperature is about 7 degrees C (45 degrees F); the mean July temperature is about 24 degrees C (75 degrees F); mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C (60 degrees F).  Frost-free season ranges from 260 to 300 days."

Peltier soils are mineral soils that are fine.  Retryde soils are mineral soils that are fine-loamy.  Venice soils have hemic organic materials to a depth of 130 centimeters (51 inches) or more.  Kingile soils have clayey mineral material at depths of 43 to 91 centimeters (17 to 36 inches).   Rindge soils have continuous sapric organic materials to a depth of 130 centimeters (51 inches) or more."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained; very slow runoff; permeability is moderate in the mucky mineral horizon and very rapid in the mineral substratum.  The water table is lowered by artificial drainage with open drains and pumps.  The water table is usually maintained between a depth of 91 to 122 centimeters (36 to 48 inches) during the growing season and at or near the surface sometimes during the winter months."
