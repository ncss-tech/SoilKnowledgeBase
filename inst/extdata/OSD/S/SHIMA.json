  "OVERVIEW": "The Shima series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in highly decomposed organic material underlain by coarse textured alluvium from mixed sources.  Shima soils are in fresh water marshes and river channels.  Slope is less than 2 percent.  The annual precipitation is about 381 millimeters (15 inches) and the annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).",

They formed in hydrophytic plant remains and mixed mineral alluvium.  The organic material is derived from tule and reed fibers.  Elevations are 1.5 above to 4.9 meters below sea level (5 feet above to 15 feet below sea level) and are on islands protected by levees.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 356 to 406 millimeters (14 to 16 inches).  The mean January temperature is about 7 degrees C (45 degrees F); the mean July temperature is about 24 degrees C (75 degrees F); mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C (60 degrees F).  Frost-free season ranges from 260 to 300 days."

Kingile soils have clayey mineral material at depths of 43 to 91 centimeters (17 to 36 inches).
