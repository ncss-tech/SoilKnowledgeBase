  "OVERVIEW": "The Suggsville series consists of deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey sediments overlying limestone and chalk. They are on convex ridges and side slopes on uplands of the Alabama and Mississippi Blackland Prairie and the Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Areas. Near the type location, the average annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 59 inches. Slope ranges from 1 to 35 percent.",

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Lacerda, Oktibbeha, Redco, and Wilcox series. Lacerda soils are moderately well drained, do not have an argillic horizon, and developed in materials derived from shale. Oktibbeha soils are very deep to chalk bedrock and are moderately well drained. Redco soils are very deep and are moderately well drained. Wilcox soils are somewhat poorly drained and are deep to acid shale."

Slopes are generally 2 to 10 percent, but may be as steep as 35 percent in some places. These soils formed in clayey sediments and the underlying limestone, chalk, and marl of Eocene and Oligocene age. The average annual air temperature ranges from 60 to 65 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 52 to 64 inches."

Brantley, Lorman, and Okeelala soils are commonly in slightly higher or slightly lower positions. Brantley and Lorman are fine-textured, have mixed mineralogy, and are very deep. Okeelala soils are fine-loamy and are very deep. Prim soils are commonly in slightly higher positions and are shallow to bedrock and calcareous to the surface. The moderately deep Sumter soils are commonly in slightly higher or slightly lower positions and are calcareous to the surface. Watsonia soils are in positions similar to those of the Suggsville series and are shallow to bedrock."
