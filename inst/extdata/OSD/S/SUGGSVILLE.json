Content of rounded quartzite pebbles ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon, if present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is commonly clay loam, silty clay loam, clay, or silty clay, but ranges to loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid. It ranges from 0 to 4 inches thick.\nThe Ap horizon, if present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, clay, or silty clay. Reaction is commonly very strongly acid or strongly acid, but ranges to neutral in areas that have been limed. It ranges from 0 to 8 inches thick.\nThe BA or AB horizon, if it occurs, has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is commonly multicolored in shades of red and brown. Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, clay, or silty clay. Reaction is commonly very strongly acid or strongly acid, but ranges to neutral where lime has been added.\nThe Bt or Btss horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Subhorizons in some pedons are multicolored in shades of red and brown. Texture is clay in the upper part and clay or silty clay in the lower part. Soft, black masses or stains of iron and manganese oxides range from none to common. Redoximorphic accumulations in shades of brown or red range from none to common. Some pedons have few or common redox depletions in shades of brown or gray below a depth of 30 inches. Reaction is very strongly acid in the upper part and ranges from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part.\nThe BC or CB horizon, if it occurs, has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8, or it has no dominant matrix color and is multicolored in shades of red, olive, and brown. Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay. Soft, black masses or stains of iron and manganese oxides range from none to common. Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, red, or gray range from none to common. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon, if it occurs, is soft, highly weathered limestone or chalk with crushed texture of loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 8. It is massive or has platy rock structure. Some pedons have a thin C horizon with hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 8. Texture is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Lacerda, Oktibbeha, Redco, and Wilcox series. Lacerda soils are moderately well drained, do not have an argillic horizon, and developed in materials derived from shale. Oktibbeha soils are very deep to chalk bedrock and are moderately well drained. Redco soils are very deep and are moderately well drained. Wilcox soils are somewhat poorly drained and are deep to acid shale."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Suggsville soils are on ridges, benches, and side slopes on uplands of the Alabama and Mississippi Blackland Prairie (MLRA 135A) and the Southern Coastal Plain (MLRA 133A) Major Land Resource Areas. Slopes are generally 2 to 10 percent, but may be as steep as 35 percent in some places. These soils formed in clayey sediments and the underlying limestone, chalk, and marl of Eocene and Oligocene age. The average annual air temperature ranges from 60 to 65 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 52 to 64 inches."

Brantley, Lorman, and Okeelala soils are commonly in slightly higher or slightly lower positions. Brantley and Lorman are fine-textured, have mixed mineralogy, and are very deep. Okeelala soils are fine-loamy and are very deep. Prim soils are commonly in slightly higher positions and are shallow to bedrock and calcareous to the surface. The moderately deep Sumter soils are commonly in slightly higher or slightly lower positions and are calcareous to the surface. Watsonia soils are in positions similar to those of the Suggsville series and are shallow to bedrock."
