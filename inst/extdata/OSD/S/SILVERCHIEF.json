  "OVERVIEW": "The Silverchief series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
