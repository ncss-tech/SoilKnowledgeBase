The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to glacial outwash material is 40 to over 60 inches and depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to redox concentrations is 30 to 40 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The ash mantle (A, C, 2C horizons) contains 50 to 70 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate, phosphate retention of 75 to 85 percent, acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron is 1.5 to 2.5 percent, and the 15-bar water content on dried and undried samples is 5 to 12 percent.\nThe Oi horizon is 1 to 3 inches thick except where disturbed.\nThe A and C horizon has hue of 10YR moist and dry, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 through 4 dry.  It contains 5 to 15 percent pumice gravel. It is slightly acid or neutral.  Base saturation by ammonium acetate is 40 to 50 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 through 7 dry and chroma of 1 through 3 moist, 1 through 4 dry.  It is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or sandy loam.  It has 5 to 15 percent gravel. It has common to many prominent mottles.\nThe 3B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR moist and dry, value of 2 or 3 moist, 5 or 6 dry, chroma of 2 moist, and 3 or 4 dry.  It is very fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It contains 5 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Total rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 10 percent.  It has common to many distinct to prominent redox concentrations."
