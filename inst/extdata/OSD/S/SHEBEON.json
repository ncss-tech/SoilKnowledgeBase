  "REVDATE": "01/2017",
  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Shebeon series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are moderately deep to dense till. Shebeon soils formed in loamy till on wave-worked till plains, water-lain moraines, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
