  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

They formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits overlying dolomitic sandstone and limestone. Slopes range from 1 to 70 percent slopes.  Mean annual precipitation is about 710 to 860 millimeters, and the mean annual temperature is about 3 to 5 degrees C."

Deerton soils are moderately deep and are on adjacent acidic sandstone benches.  Gongeau soils are poorly drained and Jeske soils are somewhat poorly drained.  They are in depressions and drainageways on adjacent acidic sandstone benches.  Furlong soils are somewhat excessively drained, moderately deep sandy soils overlying dolomitic sandstone and limestone.  Longrie soils are well drained moderately deep loamy soils overlying dolomitic sandstone and limestone."
