  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to soft bedrock typically is 30 to 40 inches, but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 10 to 30 inches.  The 10- to 40-inch particle-size control section averages between 18 and 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine and coarser sand.  Stony phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is silt loam, but some is loam or silty clay loam.  It has weak or moderate prismatic structure that parts to weak or moderate, medium or coarse subangular blocky.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have BC horizons.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is silt loam or silty clay loam, but some is loam.  Carbonates are both diffused and in soft accumulations.  The Bk horizon contains 10 to 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon is soft bedrock that is massive or stratified siltstone or silty shale."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Amsterdam, Bryant, Golva, Omio, Peritsa and Temvik series.  Amsterdam soils contain significant quantities of glass shards and are in intermountain valleys.  Bryant, Golva, Peritsa and Temvik soils do not have siltstone within depths of 40 inches.  Omio soils do not have Bk horizons and formed in calcareous loess overlying soft siltstone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sen soils are level to strongly sloping on upland plains.  Slope gradients commonly are 3 to 8 percent, but range from 0 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in calcareous siltstone or sandstone.  The climate is cool, semiarid.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 39 F to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 13 to 18 inches.  Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Amor, Cabba, Chama, Farland, Grail, Grassna, Morton and Savage soils.  Amor soils are on nearby upland plains where the bedrock contains more sand.  They are fine-loamy.  Cabba soils are on the crests of hills and steep side slopes.  They do not have Bw horizons and have siltstone within depths of 20 inches.  Chama soils are on convex areas in the same landscape as the Sen soils.  They have carbonates within depths of 10 inches.  Farland soils are on nearly level terraces and Morton soils are on well drained uplands and in complex with Sen soils in some places.  Both of these soils have an argillic horizon.  In addition, Farland soils do not have siltstone within depths of 40 inches.  Grail soils are in concave swales and fans and Savage soils are on nearly level terraces.  Both these soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have argillic horizons.  Grassna soils are in concave swales and on foot slopes.  They have a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches thick and are very deep."
