    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to a paralithic contact of dense compact glacial till and thickness of the volcanic ash influence range from 40 to 60 inches.  The solum is l7 to 35 inches thick.  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts for 60 to 75 days within the four months that follow the summer solstice in 6 or more years out of l0.  Unweathered coarse fragments in the particle-size control section average 20 to 35 percent, although individual horizons contain up to 50 percent.  The control section also includes 0 to l5 percent weathered coarse fragment by weighted average.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or l0YR and chroma of 2 through 4 moist, 3 or 4 dry.  It has l0 to 25 percent hard pebbles and 0 to l0 percent weathered pebbles.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or l0YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  It averages 20 to 35 percent unweathered pebbles, but it has l0 to 50 percent unweathered pebbles and 0 to 20 percent weathered pebbles in individual subhorizons.  It is loam, gravelly loam, or gravelly fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of l0YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has 20 to 50 percent unweathered pebbles and 0 to l5 percent weathered pebbles.  It is gravelly loam, gravelly fine sandy loam, or very gravelly sandy loam.\nThe 2Cr horizon is dense glacial till that breaks to gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly loam or very gravelly sandy loam.  It has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 through 7 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry."

Bullards soils have a difference of 5 to 9 degrees F between mean summer and mean winter temperature.  Cathcart, Giles, and Pastik soils have less than l5 percent unweathered rock fragments in the control section.  Chuckanut soils have 15 to 35 percent unweathered rock fragments in the control section by weighted average.  Comar soils are 15 to 80 percent weathered siltstone in the particle-size control section.  Kickerville soils have a 2C horizon of very gravelly sand or extremely gravelly sand in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Littlejohn soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Nati and Revel soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact with sandstone.  Nevat soils have a 7-to l3- inch layer of sand-size volcanic ash on the surface.  Sadie and Sehome soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact with dense compact glacial till.  Sulsavar soils are stratified throughout the control section."

    "content": "REMARKS:  This pedon reflects a change in classification fro medial, mesic Andic Xerochrepts to coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Haplorthods.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 3 inches and a spodic horizon from 3 to 30 inches.  The spodic horizon does not meet chemical criteria for a spodic horizon but does have micro morphology, i.e. cracked coatings and silt-sized and larger pellets.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.
