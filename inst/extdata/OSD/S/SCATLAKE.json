  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Scatlake soils are continuously saturated with saline water.  Soil salinity, or electrical conductivity, is 8 to more than 16 ds/m in more than half of the upper 50 cm.  The n-value of all mineral horizons is 1 or more.  Extractable sodium averages more than 20 percent in some horizons of the 10- to 40-inch particle-size control section.  Most pedons have an organic surface layer 2 to 10 inches thick.\nThe Oa horizon, where present, has color with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is muck or peat.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has color with hue of 10YR to 5BG, or N, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is clay, mucky clay, or mucky silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Cg horizons have color with hue of 10YR to 5BG, or N, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or less.  Masses of iron accumulation range none to few in shades of brown. Texture is clay that is very fluid.  Some pedons have thin layers of black muck.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

Bancker soils have n-value or 0.7 or more in the upper 20 inches.  Barbary and Larose soils have less than 20 percent extractable sodium in the particle-size control section.  In addition, Larose soils are continuously saturated with fresh water.  Capers soils have 0.6 to 2.0 percent sulfides in the upper 20 inches of the solum.  Fausse, Harris, Ijam, and Placedo soils have n-value less than 0.7 in all horizons.  Gentilly soils have lower\nhorizons with n-value of less than 0.7."
