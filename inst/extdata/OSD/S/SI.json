  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 9 to 20 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist.  The control section contains 0 to 5 percent coarse fragments, 5 to 15 percent clay and less than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand by weighted average.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Structure ranges from weak to moderate medium and fine granular.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is stratified silt loam to fine sandy loam and has some thin strata of loamy fine sand or fine sand in some pedons.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid."

All of these soils have more than 20 degrees F difference between mean winter and mean summer soil temperature.  In addition, Arenzville soils have a buried Ab horizon at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Chaseburg, Hadley, and Haymond soils lack a Bw horizon.  Juneau soils have a buried A or B horizon at depths of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Si soils are on flood plains and low terraces at elevations ranging from 400 to 500 feet.  They formed in recent alluvium.  Average January temperature is 38 degrees F, an average July temperature is 63 degrees F, and mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The frost free season is near 150 days.  The average annual precipitation is 70 to 80 inches, most of which falls as rain during the winter months.  Each of the summer months has at least 1 inch of precipitation.  Snow is infrequent."

Bellingham soils are in a fine family.  Edgewick soils are coarse-loamy and have an umbric epipedon.  Everett soils are sandy-skeletal. Nooksack soils have a mollic epipedon.  Pilchuck soils are sandy.  Puget soils have an aquic moisture regime.  Salal soils have an umbric epipedon.  Seattle and Tukwila soils are Histosols."
