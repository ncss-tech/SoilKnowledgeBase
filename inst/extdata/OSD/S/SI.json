These soils are usually moist.  The control section contains 0 to 5 percent coarse fragments, 5 to 15 percent clay and less than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand by weighted average.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Structure ranges from weak to moderate medium and fine granular.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is stratified silt loam to fine sandy loam and has some thin strata of loamy fine sand or fine sand in some pedons.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid."

Average January temperature is 38 degrees F, an average July temperature is 63 degrees F, and mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The frost free season is near 150 days.  The average annual precipitation is 70 to 80 inches, most of which falls as rain during the winter months.  Each of the summer months has at least 1 inch of precipitation.  Snow is infrequent."
