  "OVERVIEW": "The Skookumhouse series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed colluvium and residuum from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types.  Skookumhouse soil are on broad ridgetops and stable benches of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
