They formed in Holocene fan or stream alluvium superimposed on Pleistocene relict basin floors.  The average annual precipitation is 7 to 10 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain.  Mean annual temperature is 69 to 75 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 240 to 325 days."
