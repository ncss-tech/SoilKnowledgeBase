  "OVERVIEW": "The Shontik series consists of very deep, well drained, saline and sodic soils that formed in stream and fan alluvium.  Shontik soils are on stream terraces and fan terraces with slopes ranging from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 71 degrees F.",
