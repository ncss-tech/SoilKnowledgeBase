Other soils in closely associated families are the Bloomsdale, Cedargap, Dunning and Hercules series, all in similar positions. These soils are all more than 60 inches to bedrock. In addition, Bloomsdale and Cedargap soils are loamy-skeletal. Dunning soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments and Hercules soils have a mollic epipedon more than 24 inches thick."

Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 55 to 59 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches."

Gasconade and Gatewood soils are on uplands and are less than 40 inches deep to bedrock. Ocie soils are on uplands and are in the loamy-skeletal over clayey particle size family. Hartville soils lack a mollic epipedon and the high content of coarse fragments and are found above the Stultz soils on stream terraces."
