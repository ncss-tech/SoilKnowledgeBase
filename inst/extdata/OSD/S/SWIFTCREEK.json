  "OVERVIEW": "The Swiftcreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium or slide deposits derived from limestone. These soils occur on hills and rotational slides.  Slopes are 10 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.",
