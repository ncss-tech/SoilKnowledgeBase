  "OVERVIEW": "The Siroco series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from intermediate and basic igneous rocks. Siroco soils are on fan remnants and have slopes of 8 to 25 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 20 to 25 inches thick.  The combined thickness of the A and Bt horizons ranges from 30 to 37 inches, overlying horizons of strong carbonate accumulation. The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon averages 35 to 40 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments. The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 45 to 47 F. and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 63 F. These soils are usually moist but are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days in all parts of the moisture control section in more than 7 out of 10 years.  The soil moisture regime is typic xeric.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. It has weak and moderate thin through thick platy structure that parts to weak fine through medium granular or subangular blocky structure. Rock fragments range from 5 to 25 percent. This horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe BAt and Bt horizons has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value 4 or 5 dry, 2 to 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and moist. It ranges from clay loam, clay or gravelly clay loam to gravelly sandy clay. Rock fragments range from 15 to 45 percent in individual layers, but averages 15 to 35 percent, mainly gravel and cobbles.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 1OYR or 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist and chroma of 1 through 4. It is gravelly loam, gravelly clay loam, very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly loamy coarse sand or loam in individual layers. Rock fragments range from 10 to 60 percent."
