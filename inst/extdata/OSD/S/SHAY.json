    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shay soils are on slightly entrenched narrow stream valleys and on river flood plains. Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent.  Shay soils formed in fine textured, calcareous alluvium derived principally from shale and limestone. The climate is dry subhumid. The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F., average summer temperature from 62 to 68 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation from 14 to 17 inches. The freeze free period ranges from 120 to 140 days."

Abajo, Monticello and Northdale soils have argillic horizons and are not saturated with water within 40 inches for 90 days. Monticello and Northdale soils contain less than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizons."
