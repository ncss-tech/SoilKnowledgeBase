  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 46 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle size control section averages between 25 and 35 percent clay and 50 to 85 percent rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 40 to 60 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and may include the upper part of the Bw horizon.  The profile is strongly to moderately acid throughout.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2  or 3 moist and dry.  It is extremely gravelly loam with 10 to 20 percent clay.  It has 50 to 60 percent gravel and 5 to 15 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is extremely cobbly loam,  extremely cobbly clay loam or very cobbly clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay.  It has 25 to 40 percent gravel, 25 to 40 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones."

Balsam soils contain rock fragments of gneiss or granite origin and few to common mica flakes throughout the particle-size control section.  Gamelake soils are very deep and have 5 to 15 percent clay and more than 30 percent coarser than fine sand in the particle size control section. Illahee soils have 15 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Scaredman soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Stackyards soils are on metastable to active north-facing side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 90 percent. The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types of the Dothan Formation.  Elevations are 2,500 to 3,800 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and warm moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 130 to 160 inches.   The mean annual temperature is  40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."

Bobsgarden soils are very deep and occur on broad ridgetops and adjacent south-facing slopes of mountains.  Euchrand soils occur on side slopes of mountains, are 10 to 20 inches deep to bedrock, and have an ochric epipedon.  Pyrady soils occur on ridgetops and side slopes of mountains, have argillic horizons, are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock, and are moderately well drained.  Rilea and Yorel soils occur on broad ridgetops or sideslopes of mountains, are  20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock, and have ochric epipedons.  In addition, Yorel soils are fine-loamy.  Zalea soils occur on ridgetops and side slopes of mountains, are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock, and are fine-loamy."
