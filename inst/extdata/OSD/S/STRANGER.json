    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are Toquerville (UT), Scheifflin (AZ) and Pioneertown (CA) series. Toquerville soils are formed in eolian depositions over sandstone, are deeper than 25 centimeters (10 inches) to bedrock, and have 2.5YR or 5YR hues.  Scheifflin soils have a ustic-aridic soil moisture regime. Pioneertown soils are formed from monzogranite, have an aridic bordering on xeric soil moisture regime, and a mean annual soil temperature of 15 to 19 degrees C."

Elevations range from 705 to 1,185 meters (2,312 to 3,886 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 175 millimeters (4 to 7 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 17 to 20 degrees C (62 to 68 degrees F). The frost-free season is 270 to 320 days."

Grubstake soils are on similar landscape positions, have a loamy particle-size control section, a diagnostic cambic horizon and are more than 25 centimeters deep to a lithic contact. Coppermine soils also are deeper than 25 centimeters to the lithic contact."
