  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Duda, McKelvie, Peji, Tivin, Tonalea and Valentine series.  Duda and Peji soils have sandstone at depths between 20 and 40 inches.  McKelvie soils average less than 35 percent medium and coarse sand in the particle size control section and have sandstone gravel in the pedon. Tivin soils have a higher mean annual temperature and higher mean annual precipitation.  Tonalea soils are moderately deep over sandstone. Valentine soils have particle size control sections of fine sand to loamy fine sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Simeon soils typically are on terraces along major streams and less frequently on uplands.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 30 percent. These soils formed in sandy alluvium or outwash material. In some places the surface has been reworked by the wind into an undulating topography.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from about 18 to 24 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Valentine soils and the Dunday, Meadin and O'Neill soils.  Valentine soils occur on nearly level to steep slopes above Simeon soils.  Dunday soils have mollic epipedons and occur on nearly level to strongly sloping areas generally above Simeon soils.  Meadin soils are on similar landscapes, have a mollic epipedon and have a sandy-skeletal control section.  O'Neill soils are typically on higher, less sloping areas.  They have a mollic epipedon and have a coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal control section."
