  "REVDATE": "06/2000",
  "STATES": "MN,SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sverdrup series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial outwash deposits consisting of a loamy mantle and underlying sandy deposits. These soils have moderately rapid permeability in the upper part and rapid permeability in the lower part. These soils are on outwash plains, terraces, and moraines. They have slopes of 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 44 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 25 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to carbonates ranges from 15 to 44 inches. The coarse-loamy mantle is 14 to 24 inches thick. Between depths of 10 and 40 inches, the average texture is loamy fine sand or coarser. These soils have less than 5 percent gravel in the mantle and less than 10 percent in the 2C horizons. These rock fragments typically are in the C horizon and are mostly less than 5 mm in size. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick.\nThe A horizons have value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 in the upper part and chroma of 1 or 2 in the lower part. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam in the upper part. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand in the lower part. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or sand. It is slightly or moderately alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in calcareous, coarse-loamy and sandy glacial outwash. The mean annual air temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 22 to 29 inches.  Frost-free days range from 120 to 160.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 990 to 1950 feet."

Moderately well drained Clontarf and moderately well and somewhat poorly drained Malachy soils have a thicker mollic epipedon and are on lower- lying terrain. Also, Malachy soils are calcareous in all parts. Poorly and very poorly drained Arveson soils are in nearby level areas and depressions and have a calcic horizon beginning within depths of 16 inches."
