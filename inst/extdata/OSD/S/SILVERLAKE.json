The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and may include part of the argillic horizon. The depth to the 2Btk horizon ranges from 10 to 15 inches. The particle-size control section is 35 to 45 percent clay. The depth to the strongly cemented duripan is 40 to 60 inches.\nThe Ap and A horizons have value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Soil reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Btk horizons have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, and 10YR. The upper part of the 2Btk horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 moist and dry. The lower part has value of 3 or 4 moist, 3 to 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. The 2Btk horizons are clay or silty clay loam with 35 to 45 percent clay. It has 0 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles. Segregated lime may appear as filaments or soft masses or in seams. Soil reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline. It has 5 to 10 percent CaCO3 equivalent.\nThe 3Bk horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7 moist, 5 to 8 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. The 3Bk horizon has 0 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles. The 3Bk1 horizon is gravelly silt loam, gravelly loam, silty clay loam, or gravelly clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay and less than 35 percent total rock fragments.  The 3Bk2 horizon is very gravelly silt loam, gravelly silt loam, gravelly loam, gravelly clay loam, or silty clay loam.  It has less than 40 percent total rock fragments.  Soil reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline. It has 5 to 10 percent CaCO3 equivalent.\nThe 4Bkqm horizon has value of 5 to 7 moist, 7 or 8 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.

They formed in glaciofluvial deposits and are influenced by loess in the surface horizons. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 17 inches. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The mean frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
