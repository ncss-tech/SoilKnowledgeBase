  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These alluvial sediments are more than 80 inches thick.  The weighted average clay content of the 10- to 40-inch particle-size control section is 18 to 35 percent.  Most pedons are calcareous throughout.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Soil salinity ranges from 8 to 25 dS/m in most pedons.\nThe Oe horizon (hemic soil materials) ranges from 0 to 5 inches thick.  Color is in shades of gray or black in hue of 10YR to 5Y.  The remains of sedges, reeds, cattails and other herbaceous plants can be recognized.  However, much of this material has undergone decomposition and cannot be recognized.  Mineral soil materials comprise 0 to 25 percent by volume.  Most pedons have an Oe horizon; however, as a result of fire the Oe horizon may be destroyed for a short period.\nThe Ag horizon ranges from 10 to 20 inches thick.  Color is in hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 2 or has neutral colors of N2/0 or N3/0.  Texture is clay, silty clay, clay loam or sandy clay loam.  Most pedons have iron concentrations in shades of brown or yellow in the lower part of the A horizon.\nThe Cg horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of N/ to 2.  Texture is sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam and most pedons have sandy horizons below the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Some pedons have thin buried A horizons.  Redox features in shades of brown, yellow, gray or green range from few to many.  Some pedons contain a few concretions of calcium carbonate and small sea shells."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.  Series in similar families include Bluff, Placedo, and Surfside series.  Bluff soils are not saline or calcareous and have siliceous mineralogy.  Placedo soils have a fine particle-size control section and have a ochric epipedon.  Surfside soils have a very-fine particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Swan soils are salt marshes in nearly level flood plains of rivers and streams, and coastal areas adjacent to bays at or near sea level.  The soil formed in saline, loamy and clayey alluvium.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 70 to 72 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 46 inches.  Frost-free days range from 260 to 300 days and elevation ranges from 0 to 10 feet.  The Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 52 to 62."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",

Navidad soils have a mollic epipedon thicker than 20 inches.  Placedo soils occur in similar flood plain positions.  Aransas and Navidad soils are on slightly higher flood plain positions."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained; runoff is negligible or the soil is ponded; very slow permeability in the surface layer and moderately slow to rapid in the underlying material.  A water table fluctuates from 0.5 feet above the surface to 1 foot below the surface.  The soils are flooded by fresh water following heavy rains.  High tides cover the soils once or twice a month.  During periods of flooding, water is ponded from 1 foot to about 5 feet deep for several days."
