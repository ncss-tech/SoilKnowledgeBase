  "OVERVIEW": "The Shannock series consists of very deep subaqueous soils permanently submerged beneath 0 to about 3 meters of water on shoreline and lake plain landscapes of freshwater ponds, lakes, and reservoirs. The soil formed in a thick mantle of recent lacustrine sediments over glacial lacustrine and/or glacial fluvial sediments. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C and the mean annual precipitation is about 1143 mm.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Shannock soils are named for the village of Shannock, Rhode Island.\nThe soil was classified based on its properties and current taxonomy. This soil does not currently classify with other subaqueous soils due to the lack of subaqueous Inceptisols in the current version of soil taxonomy.   A proposal to classify subaqueous soils in the Entisols order is under consideration.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1.\tPeraquic Feature - positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface\n2.\tUmbric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 52 cm. (A1 and A2 horizons)\n3.\tParticle size control section - 25 to 100 cm. (A, Cg1, Cg2, and Cg3 horizons)\n4.\tSandy particle size- textures of loamy sand or sand throughout the control section\n5.\tAcid reaction class-the zone from 25 to 100 cm. has reaction less than about 5.5 in water, 1:1throughout the control section((A2, Cg1, Cg2, and Cg3 horizons).\nAdditional Data: Reference samples for the typical pedon from  2011RI009033, University of Rhode Island, 2011. Additional reference samples include pedons, 2011RI009015, 2011RI009037, 2011RI009001, 2011RI009041, 2011RI009040, 2011RI009013, 2011RI009014, and 2011RI009035, by the University of Rhode Island, 2011."
