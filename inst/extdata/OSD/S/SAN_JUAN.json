    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: San Juan soils are on dunes, hillslopes, and glacial outwash plains with slopes of 0 to 60 percent and elevations from 0 to about 300 feet. These soils formed in eolian sands over glacial outwash. The maritime climate is characterized by warm dry summers and mild moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 18 to 30 inches. Average annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is 200 to 240 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ebeys, Hoypus, Keystone, Pilepoint, and Snakelum soils, all of which also occur on hillslopes and glacial outwash plains. Ebeys soils are formed entirely in well sorted eolian and glacial outwash sands with no appreciable gravel or cobbles. Hoypus soils lack a mollic epipedon and have a sandy-skeletal particle-size control section. Keystone soils lack a mollic epipedon and are formed in well sorted eolian and glacial outwash sands with no appreciable gravel or cobbles. Pilepoint soils have an argillic horizon, are 20 to 40 inches to a densic contact, and have redoximorphic features at 20 to 40 inches. Snakelum soils are not pachic and formed in dense stratified glacial outwash and drift."
