  "OVERVIEW": "The San Juan series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in eolian sands over glacial outwash. San Juan soils are on dunes, hillslopes, and glacial outwash plains with slopes of 0 to 60 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 20 inches and average annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Ebeys soils are formed entirely in well sorted eolian and glacial outwash sands with no appreciable gravel or cobbles. Hoypus soils lack a mollic epipedon and have a sandy-skeletal particle-size control section. Keystone soils lack a mollic epipedon and are formed in well sorted eolian and glacial outwash sands with no appreciable gravel or cobbles. Pilepoint soils have an argillic horizon, are 20 to 40 inches to a densic contact, and have redoximorphic features at 20 to 40 inches. Snakelum soils are not pachic and formed in dense stratified glacial outwash and drift."
