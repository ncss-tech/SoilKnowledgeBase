  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the organic material ranges from 16 to 50 inches.  Reaction of the upper part of the C horizon ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid and the lower part ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline.  The weighted average clay content of the mineral material within the control section is more than 35 percent.  Base saturation of the C horizon is more than 35 percent.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3; hue of 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2; or is neutral hue of (N) with value of 2 or 3.  The fiber content after rubbing is 16 percent or less of the soil volume.  The fibers are dominantly those of nonwoody plants.  Sodium pyrophosphate extract has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8; or value of 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or less; or it is neutral (N) with value of 2 to 4.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay, with clay content of more than 28 percent.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or less, or it is neutral (N) with value of 4 to 7.  Texture dominantly is sandy clay or clay. On flood plains, sand or loamy sand may occur below 60 inches."

Natural vegetation consists of maidencane, cordgrass, cattail, bulrush, goldenrod, cutgrass, buttonbush, and other aquatic plants.  A few areas may have scattered cypress and water tupelo.  Swamp vegetation including cypress, water tupelo, sweetgum and red maple dominate the flood plains.  Some areas have been drained and are used for truck crops or improved pasture."
