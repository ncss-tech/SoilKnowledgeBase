  "REVDATE": "06/1999",
  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Syrene series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in glaciolacustrine sediments consisting of a loamy mantle over sandy sediments on beaches of lake plains.  These soils have moderate or moderately rapid permeability in the upper part and rapid permeability in the lower part.  They have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness.  The calcic horizon is 6 to 24 inches thick.  Carbonates occur in all parts of the profile.  The soil is slightly or moderately alkaline throughout.  The loamy upper sediment ranges from 12 to 24 inches in thickness.  The upper sediment has less than 10 percent rock fragments.  The lower sediment averages 10 to 35 percent rock fragments above 60 inches.  It may have layers that have less than 10 percent rock fragments.  It may have subhorizons below 60 inches that have more than 35 percent rock fragments.  The fine-earth fraction of the particle-size control section has texture of loamy fine sand or coarser.  The upper sediment averages less than 18 percent noncarbonate clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1, or is N 2/0 or N 3/0.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam or silt loam.  These textures may have a mucky modifier in the depressional phase.\nThe Bkg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less.  It has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features or a matrix with chroma of 1 or less, or both.  Texture is similar to that of the A horizon and calcium carbonate content ranges from 15 to 35 percent.\nThe 2Bkg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It commonly has redox features in all parts.  Subhorizons with redder hue or higher chroma are in some pedons below depths of 30 inches.  The fine-earth fraction is coarse sand, sand, fine sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Stratification of these textures occurs in some pedons.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It commonly has few to many and faint to prominent redoximorphic features.  It is fine sand, sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly analogues of these textures."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils have slightly convex to slightly concave slopes with gradient of less than two percent. They are on lake plains mostly adjacent to beach ridges.  They formed in 12 to 24 inches of loamy sediments over sandy sediments.  These sediments are of Lake Agassiz origin.  Mean annual precipitation is 19 to 24 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 36 to 45 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 90 to 150 days.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 650 to 2000 feet."

The Arveson, Hangaard, Mavie and Rosewood soils are poorly drained and are on landscape positions similar to the Syrene soils.  Arveson and Rosewood soils contain less than 10 percent gravel in the particle-size control section.  Hangaard soils lack calcic horizons.  Mavie soils have a loamy 3C horizon beginning between 20 and 40 inches.  The Foxhome and Radium soils are moderately well drained and are on higher lying areas.  Sandberg and Sioux soils are excessively drained and are on beach ridges."

Depth to an apparent seasonal high water table is at 0.5 to 1.5 feet at some time during the period of April through July most years.  It is at plus 1.0 to 0.5 feet at some time during the period of January through December in most years for the very poorly drained (depressional) phase."

The Bkg1 horizon has more than 50 percent fine or coarser sand and consequently it and the 2Bkg2 and 2C horizons were averaged.\nDiagnostic horizons and features are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 9 inches (Ap horizon); calcic horizon - the zone from 9 to 27 inches (Bkg1 and 2Bkg2 horizons); aquic soil moisture regime"
