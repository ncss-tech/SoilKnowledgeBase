  "OVERVIEW": "The Sunstroke series consists of moderately deep over hardpan, somewhat excessively drained soils on fan terraces.  These soils are formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",
