  "OVERVIEW": "The Schuster series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone and from conglomerate of sandstone and quartzite. These soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 30 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 690 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
