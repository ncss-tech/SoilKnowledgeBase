    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 10 to 19 inches thick.  The combined thickness of the Al, A2 and B2t horizons is 47 to more than 60 inches. The upper 20 inches of the B2t horizon has 22 to 35 percent clay and 45 to 60 percent rock fragments. The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 37 to 44 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 57 to 59 degrees F. The soils are usually moist, but are dry for 30 to 45 consecu-tive days during the later part of the summer. Rock fragments consist of quartzite and sandstone pebbles and cobbles, and range from 0 to 30 percent in the Al horizon, 20 to 50 percent in the A2 horizon, and 35 to 75 percent in the B2t horizon.\nThe Al horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry. It is loam or gravelly loam. This horizon is slightly or medium acid and ranges from 10 to 19 inches thick.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry and moist. It ranges from gravelly fine sandy loam to gravelly, cobbly or very cobbly loam. This horizon is slightly to medium acid, and ranges from 8 to 18 inches thick.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 6 through 8 dry and moist. It ranges from very gravelly or cobbly loam to gravelly, very gravelly or very cobbly clay loam. This horizon is slightly to medium acid and is 21 to more than 40 inches thick."

These soils formed in residuum and local alluvium weathered from sandstone and conglomerate of sandstone and quartzite. The climate is humid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 30 inches. The mean annual temperature is 35 to 41 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is 55 to 59 degrees F. and the frost free period ranges from 60 to 75 days."
