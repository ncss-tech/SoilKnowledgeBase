Elevations are 1,300 to 2,400 feet. The climate is low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches; mean annual temperature is 69 to 76 degrees F.; and the frost-free season is 280 to 320 days."

    "content": "REMARKS: The Sweetspring series was mapped as the Bitter Spring series in the original Virgin River soil survey.  Sweetspring is classified as having a hyperthermic temperature regime and a sandy-skeletal particle size control section to better represent the series concept at lower elevations.\nDiagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 1 inches (A horizon).\nArgillic horizon - 1 to 4 inches (Bt horizon).\nCalcic horizon - 4 to 62 inches (Bkq1, Bkq2, 2Bkq3 and 2Bkq4 horizons).\nPetronodic feature  17 to 62 inches (2Bkq3 and 2Bkq4 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - 1 to 40 inches (Bt, Bkq1, Bkq2, 2Bkq3 and part of the 2Bkq4 horizons).\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 12/2015. The last revision to the series was 7/2006. ET\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
