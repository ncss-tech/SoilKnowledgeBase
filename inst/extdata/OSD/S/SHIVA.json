The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and may include the upper part of the Bw horizon.  The particle-size control section is 10 to 18 percent clay, 30 to 45 percent volcanic glass and glass coated aggregate, 0.2 to 0.4 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, and 8 to 12 percent 15-bar water retention on an air-dried sample.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.  It contains 5 to 10 percent gravel gravel size pumice and 5 to 20 percent 0.5mm to 2.0mm sand-size pumice.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.

The soil formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from volcanic ash and pumice.  Slopes are 0 to 55 percent.  Elevations are 2200 to 2800 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."
