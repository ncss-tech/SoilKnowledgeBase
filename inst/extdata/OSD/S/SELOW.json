  "OVERVIEW": "The Selow series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed lacustrine and eolian deposits.  These soils are on dissected lake plains and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
