  "OVERVIEW": "The Seth series consists of very deep, well drained slowly or moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum  from basalt.  Seth soils are on basalt flows on mountaintops and mountain slopes and have slopes of 2 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 26 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.",

These soils formed residuum derived dominantly from basalt.  The mean annual temperature is 34 degrees F to 40 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 53 degrees F to 58 degrees F. Average annual precipitation is 22 to 30 inches.  The frost free period ranges from 40 to 70 days."

Gordonpoint soils have a frigid temperature regime and occur on basalt flows at lower elevations.  Winnemucca soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section and are intermixed with the Seth soils."
