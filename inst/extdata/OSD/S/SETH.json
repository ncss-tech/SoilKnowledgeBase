These soils formed residuum derived dominantly from basalt.  The mean annual temperature is 34 degrees F to 40 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 53 degrees F to 58 degrees F. Average annual precipitation is 22 to 30 inches.  The frost free period ranges from 40 to 70 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Mord, Gordonpoint and Winnemucca soils.  Mord soils do not have a thick mollic epipedon and are intermixed with the Seth soils.  Gordonpoint soils have a frigid temperature regime and occur on basalt flows at lower elevations.  Winnemucca soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section and are intermixed with the Seth soils."
