The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F., the mean summer soil temperature is 52 to 59 degrees F. and with an O horizon is 40 to 47 degrees F., and the mean winter soil temperature is 32 to 35 degrees F.  Solum thickness ranges from about 14 to 25 inches. Depth to the firm compact 2C horizon ranges from 15 to 30 inches with redox depletions having chroma of less than 2 occurring below 20 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  Coarse fragments, consisting of paragravel and paracobble size pumice, range from 15 to 30 percent in the upper part of the particle-size control section, to 35 to 70 percent in the lower part.  The soil contains more than 70 percent volcanic glass and glass-coated aggregates, phosphate retention of 25 to 50 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar moisture of less than 10 percent based on an air-dried sample.  Moist bulk density is 0.70 to 1.00 grams per cubic centimeter.  It is slightly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have an O horizon up to 3 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is paragravelly ashy fine sandy loam or paragravelly ashy sandy loam with 15 to 30 percent gravel-size pumice and 0 to 5 percent cobble-size pumice.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry with chromas of 1 or 2 dry and 1 to 3 moist.  It is ashy fine sandy loam and ashy sandy loam with 15 to 35 percent gravel-size pumice and 0 to 5 percent cobble-size pumice.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 moist, 5 to 8 dry and chroma of 2 to 6 moist and dry.

The soils are formed in dacite pumice lapilli and ash deposits about 15 to 120 feet thick.  These deposits have been locally reworked by water in the upper few feet in moist places.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and cool moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 35 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 0 to 50 days."

The ashy over ashy-pumiceous family class is not a recognized contrasting particle-size class and therefore the ashy-pumiceous class was used based on the range of characteristics for thickness of the 2Chorizon and the weighted average of over 35 percent pumice fragments from 0 to 40 inches."
