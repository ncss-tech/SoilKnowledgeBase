  "OVERVIEW": "The Seeprid series consists of deep to sandstone, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in eolian deposits over clayey-skeletal residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  These soils are on hill summits and shoulders and have slopes of 4 to 25 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 41 degrees F.",
