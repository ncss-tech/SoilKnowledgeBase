    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Skidbrackle soils are on mountains. They formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from andesite, tuff-breccia and tuff. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 5,970 to 8,200 feet. The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 50 inches, most of which comes as snow. The mean annual temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
