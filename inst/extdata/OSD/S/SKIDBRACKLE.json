  "OVERVIEW": "The Skidbrackle series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from andesite, tuff-breccia and tuff. Skidbrackle soils are on mountains. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
