  "OVERVIEW": "The Shenval series consists of deep well drained soils formed in old alluvium overlying limestone residuum on stream terraces, benches and fans.Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent, commonly being 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation near the type location is about 35 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  Depth to hard bedrock, commonly limestone, is more than 6 feet and depth to the lithologic discontinuity ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  The content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 30 percent by volume in the A horizon and 0 to 20 percent by volume in individual layers of the B horizon.  They usually consist of rounded sandstone pebbles and cobblestones above the lithologic discontinuity and chert of quartz fragments below.  Oxide concretions range from 2 to 25 percent above the lithologic discontinuity and are lacking below.  The soil is strongly acid or medium acid in the A horizon unless limed, and very strongly to medium acid in the B horizons.\nAp horizons have hues of 7.5YR or 10YR, values of 4 or 5, and chromas of 2 to 6.  Ap horizons are loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam and their gravelly and cobbly analogues.\nBt and 2Bt horizons have hues of 2.5YR or 5YR, values of 4 to 6, and chromas of 4 to 8.  Mottles in shades of brown or yellow are present in the 2Bt horizons of most pedons.  Bt horizons are heavy clay loam or clay and the 2Bt horizons are clay.  Average content of clay in the particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  BE horizons are present in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has mixed colors of red, brown, yellow, and olive.  Textures range from sandy loam to clay but are dominantly clayey."

Maury and Vertrees soils lack a lithologic discontinuity.  Springwood soils have solums les than 60 inches.  The Alto, Braddock, Braxton, Fauquier, Frederick, and Hagerstown series are in closely related families.  Alto and Braxton soils have soil temperatures above 59 degrees F.  The Braddock and Fauquier soils have sola less than 60 inches thick and Braddock soils also have a base saturation of less than 35 percent.  Frederick soils have kaolinitic mineralogy and a base saturation of less than 35 percent.  Hagerstown soils either have sola less than 60 inches thick or clay content decreases by more than 20 percent within 60 inches."

Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent, commonly being 2 to 15 percent.  Shenval soils formed in 24 to 40 inches of old alluvium derived from sandstone, shale, and limestone soils over residuum weathered from limestone.
