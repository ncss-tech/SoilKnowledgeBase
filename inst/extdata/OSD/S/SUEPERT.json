  "OVERVIEW": "The Suepert series consists of soils that are well drained and moderately deep to a hardpan, that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  They are on terraces.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
