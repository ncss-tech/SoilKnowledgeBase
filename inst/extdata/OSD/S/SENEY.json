  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Seney series consist of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils. They formed in a thin, loamy surface layer containing red, hydrous oxide clays over sandy glaciofluvial deposits on low braided stream terraces and outwash plains. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the loamy surface and high or very high in the rest of the soil.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",

The loamy surface averages 7 to 15 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3, chroma of 2 to 4. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid. It is sandy loam and fine sandy loam.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loamy sand or sand.  Concentrations of goethite (bog iron) are 0 to 35 percent. It is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sand or fine sand.  Thin strata of mucky fine sand occur in some pedons at a depth of 114 to 203 centimeters.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid."

The Bantry soils have reaction from 6.1 to 8.4 in the substratum. The Betsy Bay soil has bedrock between 76 and 127 centimeters. The Deford soil have wet soil moisture status from 0 to 15 centimeters. The Gunbarrel soils have reaction from 7.9 to 11.0 throughout the profile. The Minnewaukan soils have reaction from 6.6 to 8.4 throughout the profile. The Shuberts soil has limestone bedrock between 51 and 102 centimeters. In addition none of these soils allow a loamy red surface layer containing 7 to 15 percent hydrous oxide clays."

The inherent color of the parent material causes a red matrix in reducing environment.\nADDITIONAL DATA: The pedon descriptions supporting this series concept are stored in NASIS.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
