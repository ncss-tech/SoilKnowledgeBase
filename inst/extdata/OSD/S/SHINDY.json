  "OVERVIEW": "The Shindy series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  Shindy soils are on alluvial fans and fan remnants.  Slopes are 3 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
