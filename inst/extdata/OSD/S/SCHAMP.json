Diaz, Glasgow, Oppio, and Trunk soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Farmell soils do not have secondary carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon and do not have a lithologic discontinuity to very cobbly material.  Lanktree soils have albic horizons and do not have a lithologic discontinuity to very cobbly material.  Milkiway soils have redox concentrations and endosaturation within 150 cm of the soil surface.  Risley soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts."

Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,360 to 2,010 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm that comes mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. The frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
