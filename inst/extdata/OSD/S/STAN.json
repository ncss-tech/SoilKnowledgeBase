  "OVERVIEW": "The Stan series consists of very deep, well drained soils on terraces and alluvial fans. They formed in moderately coarse alluvium derived dominantly from quartzite and sedimentary rocks. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
