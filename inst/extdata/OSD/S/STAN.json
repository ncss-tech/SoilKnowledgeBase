The soil formed in alluvium that is dominantly from quartzite and sedimentary rock sources, but contains some rhylitic, basaltic, and granitic materials. In places, the upper part may be loess. The climate is semiarid with dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches including 2 to 5 feet of snowfall. The frost free season is 80 to 125 days."
