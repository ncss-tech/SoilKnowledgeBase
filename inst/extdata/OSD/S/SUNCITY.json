  "OVERVIEW": "The Suncity series consists of very shallow to a hardpan, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Suncity soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F.",
