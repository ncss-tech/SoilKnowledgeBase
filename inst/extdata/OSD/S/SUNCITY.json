These soils formed in old mixed alluvium weathered from a wide variety of rocks.  Suncity soils are in a hot arid continental climate.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 67 to 75 percent F.  Mean annual precipitation is 4 to 10 inches and falls mainly as thunderstorms in July, August and September, and as gentle rains in the winter.  The frost-free period is 240 to 325 days."
