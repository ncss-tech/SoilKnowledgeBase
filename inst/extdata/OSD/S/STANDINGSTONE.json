Elevation is 285 to 410 meters (935 to 1345 feet.) Most of this area formed in 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 inches) of sandstone colluvium and is underlain by residuum weathered from Mississippian-age limestone. The mean annual precipitation in this area is 1397 to 1549 millimeters (55 to 59 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 13 to 15 degrees C. (55 to 59 degrees F)."
