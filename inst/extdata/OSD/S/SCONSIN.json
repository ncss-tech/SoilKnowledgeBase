  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 12 to 36 inches. Depth to a densic contact ranges from 20 to 38 inches. Depth to stratified gravelly and sandy outwash ranges from 22 to 40 inches. The particle-size control section averages 8 to 17 percent clay and 15 to 50 percent fine sand or coarser.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the loess or silty alluvium and from 0 to 40 percent in the loamy diamicton.  Volume of gravel in the outwash ranges from 3 to 45 percent as a weighted average but ranges from 0 to 65 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the silty mantle, and from 0 to 10 percent in the loamy diamicton and underlying gravelly and sandy outwash. A few stones are on the surface or in the solum in some areas. Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum, but it ranges to neutral in the upper part where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum. Free carbonates are absent to depths of more than 5 feet.  Redox accumulations are within and above the dense loamy diamicton within a depth of 40 inches and saturation occurs there at some time in most years. Saturation is due to restricted internal drainage associated with the dense loamy diamicton.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. Where the Ap horizon has value moist of 3, value dry is 6 or more. Texture of the A or Ap is silt loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. Texture is silt loam or silt.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe E' horizon has color and texture like the E horizon described above.\nSconsin soils have a glossic horizon.  Horizonation has a wide range depending on the thickness of the silty mantle and the extent to which eluviation has occurred.  Therefore, there can be E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons singly or in combination, with or without Bt or 2Bt horizons.\nThe E part of the E/B and B/E horizons has color and texture like the E horizon described above.\nThe Bt part of the E/B and B/E horizons has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is silt loam.\nSome pedons have a Bt horizon with color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nThe 2E part of the 2E/B and 2B/E horizons has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs. The 2Bt part of the 2E/B and 2B/E horizons has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nSome pedons have a 2Bt horizon with color and texture like the 2Bt part described above.\nThe 2BCd horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.  Bulk density ranges from 1.8 to 2.0 gm/cc.\nSome pedons have a 3Bt or 3BC horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR and value and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand or coarse sand or the gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogs.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is typically stratified sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs, but some individual strata may be extremely gravelly. Sand content averages more than 90 percent in the fine earth fraction."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Antigo, Langlade, and Maincreek soils. The well drained Antigo soils and the somewhat poorly drained Maincreek soils form a drainage sequence with Sconsin soils. Antigo soils are on similar, higher, or more sloping landscape positions. Maincreek soils are on lower landscape positions or depressions.  The well drained Langlade soils are on more sloping landscapes as Sconsin soils where the loamy mantle is more than 40 inches thick."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  The potential for surface runoff ranges from negligible to medium.  Permeability is moderate in the silty and loamy mantle above the densic contact, slow or very slow in the dense loamy diamicton, and rapid or very rapid in the underlying outwash.  Sconsin soils have a perched seasonal water table above the densic contact at a depth of 1.5 to 2.5 feet for 30 to 60 days duration at some time during the period of March to June in normal years. Internal drainage is restricted by the dense loamy diamicton."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for woodland.  Timber stands are mostly American basswood, sugar maple, yellow birch, white ash, big tooth aspen, quaking aspen, and black cherry.  Some areas are used for cropland and some for pastureland.  Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay."
