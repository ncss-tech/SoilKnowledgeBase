  "OVERVIEW": "The Saugus series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed from weakly consolidated sediments.  Saugus soils are on dissected terraces and foothills and have slopes of 9 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 40 to 56 inches.  Saugus soils are on complex slopes of 9 to 50 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 60 degrees F.  and the soil temperature is not below 47 degrees F. at any time.  Soil between depths of about 5 and 15 inches is continuously dry in all parts from late April or May until late October to early December and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.  The soil profile is loam or sandy loam throughout and the 10 to 40 inch control section has less than 18 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 1 to 35 percent and are mostly gravel and a few cobblestones.  Usually the amount of rock fragments increases with depth, though in some pedons the immediate surface has a partial layer of fragments.  The profile is slightly acid to slightly alkaline and in many pedons the lower part is less acid.\nThe A horizon is light brownish gray, grayish brown, yellowish brown, brown or pale brown in 10YR or 2.5Y hue when dry.  The moist value is 4 or 5.  In some pedons the upper 1 to 4 inches is gray, dark gray or dark grayish brown.  The upper 7 inches of the A horizon has 0.4 to 1.0 percent organic matter.\nThe C horizon above the paralithic contact has a color similar to the A horizon or it has one unit higher value."

Hanford and Honcut soils are on smooth slopes of less than 9 percent and they lack a paralithic contact.  Pfeiffer and San Andreas soils have a mollic epipedon.  Pollasky soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in material weathered from weakly consolidated sediments mostly from granitic and closely related rocks.  The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches all in the form of rain.  Mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F., average January temperature is about 54 degrees F., and average July temperature is about 73 degrees F.  The freeze-free season is about 250 to 300 days."

Metz soils are sandy and are stratified with layers of finer texture."
