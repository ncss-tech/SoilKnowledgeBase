  "OVERVIEW": "The Splanod series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils on mesas and structural benches in the Grand Canyon.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from sandstone and shale of the Esplanade formation.  Slope is 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.",
