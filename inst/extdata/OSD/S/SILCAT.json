Slopes are 0 to 10 percent. Elevations range from 6,800 to 7,500 feet. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 53 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches.

Toldohn and Vessilla are shallow to shale and sandstone, respectively. Evpark and Bryway soils are moderately deep to sandstone and shale, respectively. Parkelei soils are fine-loamy and the Galzuni soils have an argillic horizon."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 2 inches. (A horizon)\nVertic properties: Slight gilgai, cracks 0.75 inches wide extending from 2 to 38 inches, and slickensides occurring from 7 to 38 inches (2BCss1 and 2BCss2 horizons). Cracks are open greater than 90 days but less than 150 cumulative days in most years. (Discrepancies between moisture regime of surrounding soils and period of open cracks are under study. The moisture regime of surrounding soils was used for classification until study results are received.)\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nThis pedon was sampled as Silkie (NSSL# S88NM-031-10) 6/23/88. After reviewing the lab data and field notes, it was decided to propose a new series and place it in the Vertisol order. (The ratio of fine clay to total clay and the lack of oriented clay in the cross section slides indicated this soil did not have an argillic horizon. The Silkie soil is classified as a Vertic Haplustalfs. As a result the classification and horizon designation were changed to reflect the vertic properties.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
