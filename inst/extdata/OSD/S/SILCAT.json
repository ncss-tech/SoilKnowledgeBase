  "OVERVIEW": "The Silcat series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, fan alluvium, and stream alluvium derived from shale. Silcat soils are on stream terraces on valley floors, fan terraces on valley sides, and footslopes of hills. Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 2 inches. (A horizon)\nVertic properties: Slight gilgai, cracks 0.75 inches wide extending from 2 to 38 inches, and slickensides occurring from 7 to 38 inches (2BCss1 and 2BCss2 horizons). Cracks are open greater than 90 days but less than 150 cumulative days in most years. (Discrepancies between moisture regime of surrounding soils and period of open cracks are under study. The moisture regime of surrounding soils was used for classification until study results are received.)\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nThis pedon was sampled as Silkie (NSSL# S88NM-031-10) 6/23/88. After reviewing the lab data and field notes, it was decided to propose a new series and place it in the Vertisol order. (The ratio of fine clay to total clay and the lack of oriented clay in the cross section slides indicated this soil did not have an argillic horizon. The Silkie soil is classified as a Vertic Haplustalfs. As a result the classification and horizon designation were changed to reflect the vertic properties.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
