  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Swope soils are on flood plains.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks including granite, basalt and andesite.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Elevations range from 1,158 to 1,219 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C.  The mean January temperature is -1 to 0 degrees C and the mean July temperature is 21 to 22 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; moderately slow permeability (moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity) in the upper part and very rapid (very high saturated hydraulic conductivity) in the strongly contrasting lower part.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 3 and 5 feet (moderately deep and deep free water occurrence classes) between April and July.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  Originally these soils were formed under more poorly drained conditions than are present today. Damming of the Carson River, diversion of river water for irrigation, and local drainage improvements have lowered the water table."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Swope soils are cultivated.  Alfalfa, small grains, sugar beets, and legume-grass pastures are the principal crops.  The dominant native vegetation is black greasewood and inland saltgrass.  Prior to the damming of the Carson River and diverting water for irrigation purposes the dominant vegetation probably consisted of meadow grasses."
