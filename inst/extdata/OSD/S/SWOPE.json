  "OVERVIEW": "The Swope series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Swope soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 127 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 3 and 5 feet (moderately deep and deep free water occurrence classes) between April and July.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  Originally these soils were formed under more poorly drained conditions than are present today. Damming of the Carson River, diversion of river water for irrigation, and local drainage improvements have lowered the water table."

The dominant native vegetation is black greasewood and inland saltgrass.  Prior to the damming of the Carson River and diverting water for irrigation purposes the dominant vegetation probably consisted of meadow grasses."
