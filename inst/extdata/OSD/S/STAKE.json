  "OVERVIEW": "The Stake series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable\nsoils that formed in mixed alluvium.  They are on low stream terraces\nand flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual\ntemperature is about 48 degrees F, and the average annual precipitation\nis about 10 inches.",
