    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Syblon soils are on uplands.  Elevations are 670 to 1,160 meters.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Syblon soils formed in residuum of consoli- dated shale and in locally transported material overlying the consolidated shale.  The climate is cool, with long cold winters, moist springs, and hot dry summers.  Mean annual temperature is 4.0 to 7.0 degrees C.  Mean annual precipi- tation is 255 to 355 mm, most of which falls during spring and early summer.  The growing season is 115 to 135 days."

Creed soils are deeper than 102 cm to a paralithic contact and have an ochric epipedon.  Dilts and Lisam soils are shallow over consoli- dated shale.  Tanna soils lack the abrupt textural change.  Weingart soils have A horizons less than 13 cm thick and have a natric horizon."
