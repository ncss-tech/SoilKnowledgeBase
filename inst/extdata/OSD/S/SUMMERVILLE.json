  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Kings Falls (T) series. Kings Falls soils have more than 5 percent gravel throughout. Other closely related series are the Glover, Peshekee, and Woodstock series. Glover soils are underlain by interbedded dark mica schist and metamorphosed limestone or phyllite bedrock. Peshekee soils are underlain by igneous or metamorphic bedrock and have spodic horizons. Woodstock soils are underlain by light colored schist, granite, or gneiss bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Summerville soils are on ground moraines, end moraines, and glacial lake benches underlain at a shallow depth by limestone. Slope gradients typically are 2 to 12 percent but range from 0 to 45 percent. Summerville soils formed in loamy materials overlying limestone bedrock. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 660 to 1016 mm (26 to 40 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.0 to 7.2 degrees C (41 to 45 degrees F)."

Well drained Longrie soils, somewhat poorly drained Sundell soils, and poorly drained Nahma soils are associated soils underlain by limestone at 50 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Well drained or moderately well drained Chatham, Onaway, and Trenary soils are near Summerville soils on higher positions on ground moraines. Excessively drained Alpena soils are in association on glacial lake benches and lake beaches."
