  "OVERVIEW": "The Suzipon series consists of very shallow to shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and eolian sand derived from Navajo sandstone. Suzipon soils are on dunes and sand sheets on structural benches. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
