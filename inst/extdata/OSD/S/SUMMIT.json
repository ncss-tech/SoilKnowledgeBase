  "OVERVIEW": "The Summit series consists of very deep, moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in clayey colluvium or residuum weathered from shales of Pennsylvanian age. These soils are on interfluves, divides, and hillslopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1041 mm (41 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
