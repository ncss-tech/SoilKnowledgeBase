The soil between the depths of 8 and 20 inches is moist in all parts for 60 consecutive days between mid January and April.  It is also moist in some part from December to May and is dry in all parts for about 180 days from June to December.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 68 degrees F.  The soil is slightly or moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 5/4; 5YR 5/4 or 6/4.  Moist colors are 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4 or 4/4; 5YR 4/4.  It has 10 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 15 percent gravels and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon is 7.5YR 4/4 or 5/4; 5YR 4/4, 5/4 or 6/4.  Moist colors are 7.5YR 4/3, 3/4 or 4/4; 5YR 3/3, 3/4 or 4/4.  It is very cobbly clay loam or very gravelly clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay, 25 to 35 percent gravels and 10 to 35 percent cobbles.  It is slightly to strongly effervescent.  Some pedons are noneffervescent."
