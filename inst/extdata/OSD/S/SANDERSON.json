  "OVERVIEW": "The Sanderson series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in gravelly, calcareous loamy alluvium and/or colluvium derived from limestone. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils occur on fans and footslopes of ridges on dissected plateaus. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 381 mm (15 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).",
