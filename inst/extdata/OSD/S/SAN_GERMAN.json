  "REVDATE": "09/2006",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The San German series consists of shallow, well drained, very slowly permeable soils on ridge tops, summits and side slopes in uplands of limestone hills and mountains of the Semiarid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  They formed in material that weathered from limestone bedrock of the Cretaceous Period.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent.",

Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Content of rock fragments range from 10 to 60 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe AC horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5R or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Content of rock fragments range from 35 to 85 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, is composed of hard semi-consolidated fractured limestone.  It has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools, and is rippable by mechanical equipment.\nThe R layer is composed of hard consolidated limestone bedrock."

In addition, Aguilita soils have a Mollic epipedon and coarse-loamy, carbonatic subsoils. Descalabrado soils formed in igneous bedrock.  Duey soils have fine-loamy carbonatic control sections.  Tuque soils have a Mollic epipedon.  Pozo Blanco soils are on lower adjacent positions, are very deep, and have a Mollic epipedon.  Seboruco soils are on slightly lower positions and have red, fine-silty control sections."
