Slopes range from 5 to 90 percent.  They formed in material that weathered from limestone bedrock.  The climate is semiarid tropical.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 78 to 80 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 40 inches."

In addition, Aguilita soils have a Mollic epipedon and coarse-loamy, carbonatic subsoils. Descalabrado soils formed in igneous bedrock.  Duey soils have fine-loamy carbonatic control sections.  Tuque soils have a Mollic epipedon.  Pozo Blanco soils are on lower adjacent positions, are very deep, and have a Mollic epipedon.  Seboruco soils are on slightly lower positions and have red, fine-silty control sections."
