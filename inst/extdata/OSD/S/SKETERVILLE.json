  "OVERVIEW": "The Sketerville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils on uplands in the Northern Piedmont province.  They formed in residuum of anorthosite.  Slopes range from 0 to 7 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

Angular rock fragments (0 to 4 inches) of blue quartz and anorthosite range from 0 to 35 percent throughout the soil.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through slightly acid in the A and E horizons, from extremely acid through strongly acid in the Bt horizon, and from very strongly acid through moderately acid in the C and Cg horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Low chroma mottles are present due to a seasonal high water table.  It is clay, silty clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, is saprolite with hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Cg horizon is saprolite with hue of 10YR through 5Y or is neutral, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or clay in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, is neutral or has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 7 or 8, and chroma of 0 or 1.  It is soft anorthosite rock that crushes to sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam."
