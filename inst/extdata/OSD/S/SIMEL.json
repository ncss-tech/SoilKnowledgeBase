Canyon, Epping, Gerst, Redarrow, Shingle, Taluce, and Tassel soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June and occur in the Great Plains.  Tesihim soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Eslendo, Picante, Quartel, Remorris, Sandoval, and Tesihim soils do not have a lithic contact below the paralithic contact. Canyon, Epping, Eslendo, Gerst, Picante, Sandoval, Shingle, Taluce, Tassel, and Tesihim soils have yellower hues than 7.5YR."
