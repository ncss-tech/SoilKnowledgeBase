  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 40 to 80 inches or more.  The particle-size control section contains from 18 to 25 percent clay, 15 to 40 percent fine sand or coarser, and 35 percent or more silt as a weighted average.  Total sand content in any part of the control section is 52 percent or less. Coarse fragments are mainly sandstone channers, but some pedons have some angular chert gravel.  Volume of sandstone channers and chert gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout.  Free carbonates are absent.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum, but ranges to neutral in the upper part where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the substratum.   Redox features are in the lower part of the series control section, and saturation occurs below 40 inches at some time in most years.\nThe Ap horizon has value and chroma of 2 or 3.  Value dry is less than 5.5.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is loam or silt loam.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 26 percent in individual subhorizons in the Bt.\nThe C horizon has color and texture like the Bt horizon described above."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Argyle, Baltimore, Bassett, Blooming, Cadmus, Caleb, Dowagiac, Dunbridge, Gara, Glenhall, Koronis, Lauramie, Lester, Longlois, Lydick, Mohawk, Neda, Newcomer, Octagon, Oneco, Orwood, Racine, Razort, Taopi, Waucoma, and Winneshiek series.  Argyle soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon and have hue of 5YR or redder (on ped faces or in the matrix) in some part of the 2Bt horizon.  Baltimore, Blooming, Dowagiac, Koronis, Lauramie, Lester, Longlois, Lydick, Newcomer, Orwood, Razort, Taopi, Waucoma, and Winneshiek series all are well drained and do not have a water table. Bassett and Racine soils have rock fragments that have igneous lithology in the till in the lower part of the series control section.  Cadmus, Glenhall, and Octagon soils will be reclassified as Oxyaquic Hapludalfs.  Mohawk and Neda soils have free carbonates in the control section.  Also, Mohawk soils have soft shale fragments in the control section.  Caleb soils have 32 to 36 percent clay in some subhorizon of the argillic and have subhorizons in the control section that contain more than 52 percent sand.  Dunbridge soils have a lithic contact at depths between 20 and 40 inches.  Gara soils average 32 to 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Oneco soils have a lithic contact at depths between 40 and 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sebbo soils are on valley sides in bedrock controlled uplands.  These soils formed in loamy and silty colluvium derived from loess mixed with sand from the local sandstone.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 52 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 680 to 1360 feet."

The well drained Council soils are nearby on hills where there is less clay in the soil.  The well drained Gale and Hixton soils are nearby on hills where the silty or loamy mantle is underlain by sandstone at 20 to 40 inches.  The well-drained Gardenvale soils are nearby on hills where the loamy mantle in underlain by sandstone at 40 to 60 inches.  The well drained Seaton soils are nearby on hills where there is a loess mantle more than 60 inches thick."
