  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick.  Depth to the horizon of carbonate accumulation ranges from 6 to 15 inches, and in some pedons the horizon is discontinuously weakly cemented. The calcium carbonate equivalent of the upper 40 inches ranges from 40 to 50 percent. Generally, the A horizon contains less than 15 percent exchangeable sodium. Exchangeable sodium increases as depth increases, and ranges from 15 to 35  percent below depths of 20 inches.  Depth to the water table is generally 10 to 30 inches, except where the soil is artificially drained the water table is generally below depths of 30 inches.  Some areas are ponded for part of the year.\nThe mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 47 to 49 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature from 60 to 62 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR of 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.5 or less.  It has weak medium to fine granular structure.  It is mildly to moderately alkaline and contains from 6 to 21 percent organic matter.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or less, but mainly 1 or less.  The chroma of 2 is accompanied by distinct or prominent mottles.  The C horizon ranges from silty clay to clay that contains less than 15 percent fine and coarser sand.  The horizon ranges from moderately to strongly alkaline, and from very strongly to strongly calcareous."

The soil formed in mixed lake sediments. The climate is dry subhumid. The average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 16 inches, the mean annual temperature from 45 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature from 69 to 72 degrees F. The freeze free period 120 to 140 days."
