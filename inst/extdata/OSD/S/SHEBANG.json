  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Shebang soils are more than 60 inches deep.  The soils are usually moist, but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 70 consecutive days in late summer. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 50 degrees F. and the mean summer soils temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 65 degrees F. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick, depth to the clayey B2t horizon is 8 to 25 inches, and the solum is more than 48 inches thick.  Depth to secondary lime ranges from 20 to 30 inches. The albic horizon contains iron and manganese concretions which are dominantly less than 2 mm. in diameter, but however, they are usually below the albic horizon.\nThe Ap horizon, or the mixed upper 7 inches, has value of 2 or less moist and 3 or 4 dry.\nThe A2 horizon has value of 2 through 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry. It is silt loam or loam.\nThe B21t horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2. The upper 20 inches of the B2t horizons is silty clay or clay and has less than 60 percent clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chicane, Conley, Kooskia, Nez Perce and Tilma series. Chicane soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick. Conley soils are somewhat poorly drained and do not have secondary lime. Kooskia and Tilma soils lack chroma of 2 or less and other characteristics associated with wetness, such as mottles and concretions in the albic horizons. Nez Perce soils have mollic epipedons 12 to 20 inches thick, have iron-manganese concretions larger than 2 mm. in the albic horizon and above depth of about 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shebang soils are on nearly level to hilly loess-covered basalt plateaus at elevations of 2,800 to 4,000 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent. The soils formed in loess and possibly residuum weathered from Columbia River Basalt in their lower horizons.  The climate is subhumid with a mean annual precipitation of 19 to 24 inches. maximum precipitation is in May and June and minimum in July and August. The average frost-free season (32 degrees F.) is about 110 to 130 days."

Penn soils have clayey Ap or A1 horizons, and wide cracks that extend below 20 inches when dry. Ferdinand soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches, and more than 35 percent rock fragments in their argillic horizons. Uhlorn soils lack A2 horizons."
