  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Undrained soils are saturated, during the winter and spring months.  The solum has evidence of wetness immediately below the mollic epipedon.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 60 degrees F.  These soils are moderately alkaline throughout.  A calcic horizon, occurs within 16 inches of the surface.  The zone of maximum lime accumulation may coincide with the mollic epipedon where the high lime content is masked by the dark color.  The A1 horizons range in dry color from very dark gray to gray with chromas of 1 or neutral hues.  Texture may range from silty loam to clay, but is usually fine and is silty clay or clay in the 10 to 40 inch zone.  Structure is moderate to strong in the upper part, is usually granular or fine, subangular blocky.  The A1 horizons are usually strongly calcareous, but may be weakly calcareous in the upper few inches in a few places.  Upper Clca horizons are gray to light gray,  close to white in 10YR to 5Y or neutral hues.  Fine distinct mottles usually occur in the lower Cca or within 20 to 40 inches of the surface.  There is much secondary lime, either in powdery form, in soft masses  or some may be in hard concretions.  Texture is a clay or silty clay.  Lower C horizons have less lime, are usually weakly calcareous, but my be strongly calcareous.   Conspicuous lime masses and concretions are absent from the lower part of the solum.  Colors are similar to the Cca horizons, but may be one unit dark or  brighter with chromas up to 1.5 in 2.5Y and 5Y hues.  Lower strata may be less fine but the lower C horizons are generally fine and moderately fine in texture.  Slickensides may be present, but are too few or too poorly developed to intersect."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Bayshore, Castro, Clear Lake, and Pescadero.  Bayshore soils have less than 35 percent clay in their control section.  Castro soils have cemented or partially cemented lime pans.  Clear Lake soils have common slickenslides and lack a calcic horizon.  Pescadero soils have A1 horizons with most values of 3.5 or more and have natric horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Sunnyvale soils occur on nearly level flood plains and basins and formed in alluvium from mixed, but dominantly sedimentary rocks.  They occur at elevations of 50 to 300 feet in a subhumid, mesothermal climate having a mean annual rainfall of 10 to 20 inches with warm dry summers and cool moist winters; an average January temperature of 48 degrees F; an average July temperature of 65 degrees F.; a mean annual temperature of about 58 degrees F.; and an average frost free season of about 260 to 300 days."
