  "OVERVIEW": "The Selbit series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks. The Selbit soils are on mountain side slopes. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
