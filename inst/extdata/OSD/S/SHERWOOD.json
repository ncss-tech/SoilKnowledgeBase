Apison, Cahaba, Durham, Granville, Hartsells, Kalmia, Linker, Maxton, and Pirum soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Cahaba, Durham, Granville, Kalmia, Maxton, and Wickham soils are not underlain by hard rock at depths less than 60 inches.  Hartsells and Linker soils lack an irregular boundary to the underlying rock.  Pirum soils have Bt horizons with hues of 7.5YR or yellower.  Sherless soils have soft sandstone or shale within 40 inches."

The soil formed in loamy residuum weathered from laminated, titled sandstone or interbedded sandstone and shale.  Mean annual temperature is 62 to 65 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 72 to 80."

Carnasaw soils occur on similar positions of the landscape as Sherwood soils.  In addition, Stapp soils have gray mottles in the upper Bt horizon, and occur in slightly concave areas.  Clebit, Pickens, and Zafra soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the B horizons and usually occur on ridge crests."
