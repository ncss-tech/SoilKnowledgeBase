    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Blago series in the same family and the Corsica, Keansburg, and Kentuck series in closely related families. Blago soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 100 inches and contain fragements of shale. Corsica and Keansburg soils are in a fine-loamy particle-size class. Kentuck soils are in a fine-silty particle-size class."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Swannanoa soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping high stream terraces, alluvial fans, or foot slopes along the broader stream and river valleys of the Southern Blue Ridge (MLRA 130B).  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from about 1,800 to 2,800 feet.  These soils formed in old alluvium washed from materials weathered from low or high-grade metamorphic and igneous rocks such as mica gneiss, hornblende gneiss, granite, metasandstone, and phyllite.  Mean annual air temperature is 56 and ranges from about 50 to 61 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation 48 and ranges from about 35 to 60 inches."

Brevard and Tate soils formed in colluvium or alluvium on nearby toe slopes, benches, and fans are in a fine-loamy particle-size class. Clifton, Cowee, Edneyville, and Evard soils formed in residuum on adjacent uplands and are well drained. Kanuga soils are moderately well drained."

Seasonal high water table is at a depth of 1.0 to 2.0 feet in winter and early spring. These soils receive surface and subsurface water from surrounding uplands."

    "content": "REMARKS: The Swannanoa series was formerly included with the Dillard or Unison series. However, Dillard soils formed in alluvium on low terraces and are fine-loamy and Unison soils are well drained and occur on high terraces.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the Swannanoa series are:\nUmbric epipedon-zone from 0 to 15 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon-zone from 15 to 64 inches (Btg1, Btg2, and Btg3 horizons)\nAquic conditions  saturation with water in all layers from the upper boundary of saturation to a depth of 80 inches (endosaturation)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data are available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE for the following pedons: S03NC-089-003, S03NC-089-004 (Typical Pedon).\nNASIS Data Map Unit ID: 489620.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
