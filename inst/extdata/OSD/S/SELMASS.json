  "OVERVIEW": "The Selmass series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loamy outwash overlying sandy sediments. They are on nearly level or slightly depressional parts of outwash plains and stream terraces and are moderately deep or deep to sandy sediments. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F).",

In drained conditions an intermittent apparent high water table is 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 46 cm (1.5 feet) below the surface in most years and in undrained conditions 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1.0 foot) below the surface. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 42.33 micrometers per second) in the solum and high or very high (42.33 to 141.11 micrometers per second) in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate to moderately rapid in the solum and rapid in the underlying material. These soils are very rarely flooded or rarely flooded for very brief or brief duration on stream terraces. Very rarely flooded or rarely flooded phases of these soils that occur on stream terraces are recognized."
