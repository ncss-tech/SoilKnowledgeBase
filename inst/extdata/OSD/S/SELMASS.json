In drained conditions an intermittent apparent high water table is 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 46 cm (1.5 feet) below the surface in most years and in undrained conditions 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1.0 foot) below the surface. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 42.33 micrometers per second) in the solum and high or very high (42.33 to 141.11 micrometers per second) in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate to moderately rapid in the solum and rapid in the underlying material. These soils are very rarely flooded or rarely flooded for very brief or brief duration on stream terraces. Very rarely flooded or rarely flooded phases of these soils that occur on stream terraces are recognized."
