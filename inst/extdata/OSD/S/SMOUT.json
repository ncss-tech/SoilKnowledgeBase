  "OVERVIEW": "The Smout series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium.  Smout soils are on flood plains.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

Cowbone soils are poorly drained, have a calcic horizon and have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections.  Tohobit soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a calcic horizon.  Zeegee soils are poorly drained and have fine-loamy particle-size control sections.  All of these soils are on nearby landscapes."
