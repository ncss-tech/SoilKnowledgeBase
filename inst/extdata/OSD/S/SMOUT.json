Cowbone soils are poorly drained, have a calcic horizon and have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections.  Tohobit soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a calcic horizon.  Zeegee soils are poorly drained and have fine-loamy particle-size control sections.  All of these soils are on nearby landscapes."
