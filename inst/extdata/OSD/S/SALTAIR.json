  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Saltair soils are on lake plains and basin floors.  They formed in lacustrine deposits and some alluvium derived mainly from limestone, shale, and quartzite.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 4,900 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid and semiarid.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, but ranges as long as 6 inches in some survey areas.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 68 to 73 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 110 to 180 days."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained or very poorly drained; negligible surface runoff if ponded, very high surface runoff otherwise; slow or very slow permeability (moderately low or low saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between the soil surface and 2.5 feet (very shallow to moderately deep free water occurrence classes) year-round.  Cumulative annual duration class is Persistent.  Some phases are susceptible to occasional ponding for brief duration from March through July with water up to 1 foot deep."

Some of this data is published on pages 142-143, Table 11 of the Soil Survey of Davis-Weber Area, Utah.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.  Another laboratory pedon of Saltair is S58UT-011-001 (pedon # 40A0962) and a very similar soil is S02UT-003-001 (pedon # 02N0154).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
