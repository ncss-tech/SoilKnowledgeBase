  "OVERVIEW": "The Saltair series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits and alluvium derived mainly from limestone, shale, and quartzite.  Saltair soils are on lake plains and basin floors.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, but ranges as long as 6 inches in some survey areas.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 68 to 73 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 110 to 180 days."

Some of this data is published on pages 142-143, Table 11 of the Soil Survey of Davis-Weber Area, Utah.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.  Another laboratory pedon of Saltair is S58UT-011-001 (pedon # 40A0962) and a very similar soil is S02UT-003-001 (pedon # 02N0154).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
