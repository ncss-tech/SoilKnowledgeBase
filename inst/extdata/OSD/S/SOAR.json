Alcan, Flex, and Ginex soils do not have hard bedrock within 100 cm. Armoine and Stodick soils have a paralithic contact at 36 to cm. Berit, Entero, Ravenell and Stodick soils average more than 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Bouncer and Harvan soils are more moist for 10 to 20 days between July and September due to convection storms. Penelas soils have more than 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Sedsked and Zyzzi soils have more than 50 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."

Elevations range from 1,405 to 1,985 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 110 to 130 days."
