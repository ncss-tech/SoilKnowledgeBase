  "OVERVIEW": "The Soar series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks. Soar soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 4 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",

Bouncer and Harvan soils are more moist for 10 to 20 days between July and September due to convection storms.
