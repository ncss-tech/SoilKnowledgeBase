  "OVERVIEW": "The Shelbiana series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in mixed alluvium weathered from sandstone, siltstone and shale. These nearly level to moderately steep soils are on stream terraces and flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent, but are dominantly 0 to 4 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 72 inches or more. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Content of subrounded gravels ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the solum and 0 to 50 percent in the substratum. The particle-size control section contains 10 to 40 percent sand; however, the weighted average of sand coarser than very fine sand is less than 15 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly to moderately acid, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4, but to a depth of 6 inches has value and chroma moist less than 4, dry value less than 6. It is loam, silt loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is commonly loam or silt loam and less commonly clay loam or silty clay loam. Some pedons have redoximorphic clay depletions in the lower part of the B horizon below 40 inches.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 8 or it is neutral with value of 3 to 8. Redoximorphic features are common and the horizon is often variegated without dominant hue or chroma. It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silt loam, loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loamy sand."

Allegheny and Hayter soils have ochric epipedons and they are fine-loamy. Bonnie soils are poorly drained and lack argillic horizons. Combs, Nelse, Philo and Pope soils are coarse-loamy and lack argillic horizons. Nolin soils have ochric epipedons and lack argillic horizons. Philo soils are moderately well-drained. Whitley soils have an ochric or thinner epipedon and less very fine sand."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Shelbiana soils are in valleys of the Cumberland-Allegheny Plateau of eastern Kentucky and were mostly mapped with Allegheny, Ashton, or Huntington soils in the past.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon - the zone from 0-16 inches (Ap, AB horizon).\nArgillic subsurface horizon - the zone from 10-50 inches (AB, Bt1 & Bt2 horizons). The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon has more than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the 20 to 200 micron fraction. Borderline data in Pike County and additional data in Bell and Harlan Counties support a change in classification from the Humic Hapludults. Amendments in Soil Taxonomy permitted classification change to Typic Palehumults.\n2005 revision places series in semiactive CEC activity class and revises description, location, competing series and geographically associated soils as per \"Keys to Soil Taxonomy 9th Edition, 2003\" and \"Field Book for describing Soils Version 2.0\"."

Therefore, on the basis of fine to total clay ratio and evidence of clay films, the horizon qualifies as an argillic."
