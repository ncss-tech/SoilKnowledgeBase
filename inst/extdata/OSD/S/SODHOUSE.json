Univega soils have nongravelly Bw horizons and are intermittently moist during summer months."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sodhouse soils are on fan remnants and plateaus.  They typically occur on summit positions.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with some influence from loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,220 to 1,890 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
