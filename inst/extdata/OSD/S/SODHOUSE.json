  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sodhouse series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with some influence from loess and volcanic ash.  Sodhouse soils are on fan remnants and plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
