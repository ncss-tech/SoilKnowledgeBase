  "OVERVIEW": "The Sumiwawa series consists of shallow to soft sandstone, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sandstone. Sumiwawa soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.\nThe mean annual precipitation is 21 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
