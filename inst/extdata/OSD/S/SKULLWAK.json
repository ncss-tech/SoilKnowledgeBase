    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Skullwak soils are on lake plains.  These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,360 to 1,740 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
