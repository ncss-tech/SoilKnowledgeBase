  "OVERVIEW": "The Skullwak series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Skullwak soils are on lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
