  "OVERVIEW": "The Shortyork series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from sandstone, schist, shale and graywacke. Shortyork soils are moderately deep to lithic material with spacing between cracks less than 10 centimeters apart. Shortyork soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 1270 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C (56 degrees F).",
