  "OVERVIEW": "The Sanje series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous clayey alluvium over very gravelly or extremely gravelly alluvium.  These soils are on terraces and fans.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 305 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.",
