Sanje soils formed in calcareous clayey alluvium overlying very gravelly or extremely gravelly alluvium.  The climate is cool, with long cold winters, moist springs, and hot dry summers.  Mean annual temperature is 5.0 to 7.0 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is 250 to 355 mm, most of which falls during spring and early summer.  The growing season is 115 to 135 days."
