  "OVERVIEW": "The Softback series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium on mountains and hills.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 12 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
