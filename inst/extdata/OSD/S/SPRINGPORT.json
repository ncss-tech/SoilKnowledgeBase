Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C (43 to 45 degrees F). Frost-free period is 90 to 140 days. Elevation is 183 to 396 meters (600 to 1300 feet) above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Algonquin soils have ochric epipedons and argillic horizons, and are on higher landscape positions. The moderately well drained Negwegon soils are on higher positions in the landscape."
