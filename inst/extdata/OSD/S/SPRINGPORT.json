  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Springport series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in silty and clayey lacustrine deposits. These soils are on lake plains and depressional areas on moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
