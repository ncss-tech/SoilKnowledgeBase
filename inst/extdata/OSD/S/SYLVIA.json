The difference between mean winter and mean summer soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F.  The lower part of the particle size control section is 35 to 50 percent clay and few or no rock fragments.  The umbric epipedon and thickness of andic soil properties is 14 to 20 inches thick.  Mottles with a chroma of 2 or less are at a depth of 14 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has strong or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure.  It is extremely acid or very strongly acid.  It has 8 to 12 cmol/kg of aluminum.  It has 10 to 20 percent organic matter.\nThe 2B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam or silty clay.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.  It has 2 to 8 cmol/kg of aluminum."
