  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 5 to 8 feet. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 37 to 39 degrees F., average summer soil temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F. and average winter soil temperature from 30 to 33 degrees F. The soil is usually moist but is generally dry between 10 and 30 inches for about 30 days in late July and early August, becoming moist again in the fall.\nThe Bs1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 3 through 6 moist. The Bs2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 3 through 6 moist. Rock fragments average from 20 to 35 percent by volume and are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter. A few cobbles and stones occur in most pedons.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 6. It ranges from very gravelly clay loam to extremely cobbly clay with clay content increasing with increased depth. The upper two feet of the horizon has 35 to 45 percent clay. Rock fragments range from 40 to 70 percent and consist of pebbles, cobbles and stones up to 20 inches in diameter."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sherburne soils are on nearly level to sloping remnants of old high level plains bordering the eastern slopes of the northern Rocky Mountains. They occur between 5,500 and 6,500 feet above sea level. Winters in the area are long and cold but are frequently interrupted by warm Chinook winds. Summers are short and relatively warm. Precipitation ranges from 20 to 35 inches with approximately 200 inches of winter snow. Parent material of the Sherburne series is very old glacial till or glacial outwash from mixed argillite, quartzite, limestone, and basic intrusive rock sources. Most of these materials are high in iron minerals. Volcanic ash makes up only 3 percent of the coarse silt fraction (20 to 50 microns) of the E horizon, and a trace below at the type location."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Babb, Croffs, Letarg, Loberg and Tenex soils. Babb soils have mollic epipedons but lack clay accumulation in the B horizon. Tenex soils lack an argillic horizon. Croffs soils occur on smooth land forms similar to the Sherburne but are under grass and have a dark colored A1 horizon. Letarg and Loberg soils occur at lower elevations than the Sherburne soils on younger glacial till."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well-drained; medium runoff; moderately slow to slow permeability. This, accompanied with frozen soils and rapid snowmelt in June, results in a perched water table for a short period in some years."
