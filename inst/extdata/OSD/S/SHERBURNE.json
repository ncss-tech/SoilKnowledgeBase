  "OVERVIEW": "The Sherburne series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in glacial till or glacial outwash from mixed sources. They occur on remnants of high level plains bordering the eastern slopes of the northern Rocky Mountains. Slopes are 2 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 710 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
