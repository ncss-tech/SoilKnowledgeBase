The soil temperature is 8.3 degrees C or below from November 1 to March 1 and is seldom below 5 degrees C.  The soil between the depths of 23 cm and 69 cm is moist in all parts less than 30 days in January and February and is dry in all parts for 245 days from April 15 to December 15; aridic moisture regime bordering on xeric.  It is noneffervescent throughout except in some pedons which have received wind blown carbonates in the upper part of the A horizon.  It has 3 to 20 percent coarse fragments throughout that are dominantly 2 to 15 mm in diameter.  Moderately well drained phases are recognized with a water table at 122 to 183 cm.\nThe Ap horizon is 10YR 4/2, 5/2, or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2, or 3/3.  Textures are loamy sand and sandy loam.  Clay content is 8 to 14 percent.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.  It has 1 to 5 percent organic matter.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3 or 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/3, 4/4 or 4/6.  Textures are sandy loam and gravelly coarse sandy loam.  It has 12 to 18 percent clay content and is 3 to 8 percent (absolute) more than the Ap horizon.  The mollic epipedon extends into the Bt horizon in many pedons.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 6/2, 6/3 or 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 4/3, 4/4, or 4/6.  Textures are coarse sand, sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or gravelly sand with 8 to 15 percent clay content.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.  Redox concentrations are present in some pedons.  The redox concentrations are the result of a former high water table or heavy irrigation."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Shabbell soils have an argillic horizon with a sandy loam texture that has 3 to 8 percent more clay content (absolute) than the A horizon which also has a sandy loam texture.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the profile are:\n1. Mollic epipedon - The zone from the surface of the soil to 41 cm (Ap1, Ap2, AB horizons)\n1.1  Organic carbon content ranges from 0.6 to 2.9 percent (modified Walkley-Black digestion method)\n1.2  Weak medium subangular blocky structure and soft dry consistence\n1.3  Base saturation assumed to be over 50 percent (pH 6.8, 6.6)\n2. Argillic horizon - The zone from 23 to 64 cm (AB and Bt horizons)\n2.1  Clay increase from 8 percent (Ap2 horizon) to 11 percent (BA horizon) and 14 percent (Bt horizon).  Determined by hydrometer method.\n2.2  Clay films bridging mineral grains and in pores.\nOther Soil Characteristics:\n1.  Thermic temperature regime -- assumption based on preliminary SCS soil/moisture transect, 55 years of local climate records and BLM data.\n2.  Mineralogy - assumed mixed, no indication otherwise\n3.  Particle-size class -- coarse-loamy based on hydrometer and field testing of the 23 to 64 cm control section.\n4.  Moisture Regime -- Soil moisture control section is dry 67 percent of the year based on SCS soil moisture/temperature transect data.\n4.1  The moisture control section is dry throughout about 215 days from May 15 to December 15.  Within this time period about 200 days are above 5 degrees C.  It is moist throughout from January 1 to February 1.\n4.2  The soil temperature exceeds 5 degrees C from February 15 to December 1 (290 days).  Within this time period, the moisture control section is dry from May 15 to December 1.\n4.3  The soil temperature exceeds 8.3 degrees C from March 1 to November 1 (245 days).  Within this time period the MCS is dry from May 15 to November 1.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
