  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Mitchellbay, Deadmanbay, Killebrew and Wellsdale series. Mitchellbay soils are loamy above the argillic horizon. Deadmanbay soils have a densic contact at 50 to 100 cm. Killebrew soils have a densic contact at 25 and 50 cm. These three soils also have a depth to redoximorphic features between 20 and 41 cm. Wellsdale soils are very deep."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sucia soils are in valleys of drift plains at elevations of 0 to 152 meters. They formed in glacial outwash over dense glaciomarine deposits. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. These soils have a mild marine climate with warm dry summers and mild moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 457 to 762 mm. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 10 degrees C. Frost-free season is 200 to 240 days."

Coveland and Sholander soils are in similar positions but occupy a lower position on the slope and have redoximorphic features at 23 to 46 cm. Spieden soils are in drainageways and depressions of outwash plains and have aquic conditions to the soil surface."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high to very high above the argillic horizon (A and Bw horizons), moderately high in the argillic horizon (2Btg horizon), and low in the densic material (2Cd horizon). Sucia soils have a water table as high as 20 cm from October through March, as high as 43 cm in April and as high as 79 cm in May and June."

The classification has changed to reflect the current central concept of Sucia soils being moderately deep to densic material and having an argillic horizon. The previous classification was sandy, isotic, mesic Aquic Xerorthents.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
