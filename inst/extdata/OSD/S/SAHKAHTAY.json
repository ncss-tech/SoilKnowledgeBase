  "REVDATE": "02/2006",
  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sahkahtay series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on outwash plains, lake plains and moraines. They formed in glacial outwash, lake plains and glacial beach deposits. Permeability is moderate in the upper part and rapid or very rapid in the underlying material. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. Average annual precipitation is about 23 inches.",
