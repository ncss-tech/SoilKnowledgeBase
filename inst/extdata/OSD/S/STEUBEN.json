  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 51 to 102 centimeters. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 43 to 66 centimeters. The solum ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid and the 2C horizon ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid. The gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the loamy part and 0 to 15 percent in the sandy part. Cobbles range from 0 to 5 percent and stones range from 0 to 2 percent throughout the pedon.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 5YR or 10YR, value of 1 or 2, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is 2 to 5 centimeters thick and is loamy sand to fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value of 5 or 6. It is loamy sand to fine sandy loam.\nThe Bh horizon has value and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bhs horizon has value and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe E part of the B/Ex horizon has value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sandy loam. The Bt part has value or 4 or 5. It is sandy loam or sandy clay loam. The E part of the B/Ex occurs as coatings around peds of Bt material and generally comprises 40 to 50 percent of the horizon. The fragipan has weak very thick platy to weak very coarse subangular blocky structure and is hard or very hard when dry and friable to very firm when moist.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sand or coarse sand with thin bands of loamy sand ranging from 0.16 to 1.27 centimeters in thickness. Bands are in the upper part of the 2C horizon and may extend to depths of 150 centimeters, but some pedons do not have them."
