  "OVERVIEW": "The Sweetapple series consists of moderately deep to soft rock, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in residuum of acid micaceous gneiss and schist.  They are upland soils in the Piedmont.  Slopes range from 6 to 60 percent.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 49 inches.",
