    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 15 to 36 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid in the A and B horizons and from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the C horizons.  Depth to the Cr horizon ranges from 24 to 50 inches.  Depth to hard bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Content of gravel ranges from 0 to 20 percent in the A and Bw1 horizon, and 10 to 30 percent in the Bw2 horizon.  Few stones are on the surface of some pedons.  Content of mica flakes ranges from common to many.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or their gravelly analogues.\nThe Bw1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  It is fine sandy loam sandy loam, loam, or their gravelly analogues.  The Bw2 horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loamy coarse sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or their gravelly analogues.\nThe C horizon is soft weathered mica gneiss or mica schist and has hue of 2.5Y to 5YR, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Pockets of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy coarse sand have a hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  The Cr horizon in mica gneiss or mica schist rock controlled structure has an occasional dyke of hard rock and may or may not have thin lenses of yellowish red sandy clay loam."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are none in the same family.  Close competitors in similar families are the Alticrest, Ashe, Ashlar, Beulah, Chandler, Louisa, Louisburg, Manor, Rion, and Wateree series.  Alticrest, Ashe, Chandler, and Manor soils have mesic temperatures.  In addition, Alticrest soils have siliceous mineralogy and Ashe soils have mixed mineralogy.  Manor soils also have hues redder than 5YR.  Ashlar, Beulah, Louisburg, Rion, and Wateree soils have mixed mineralogy and in addition, Ashlar soils have a lithic contact within 40 inches and Louisburg soils have a discontinuous argillic horizon.  Louisa soils have a paralithic contact within 20 inches."

Slopes are mainly 10 to 45 percent, but ranges from 6 to 60.  The soil formed in residuum of weathered acid micaceous metamorphic rock.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 50 inches and is evenly distributed throughout the year.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 65 degrees F."
