  "OVERVIEW": "The Simper series consists of moderately deep to duripan, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on dissected fan terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from igneous rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F., and the avergae annual precipitaion is 13 inches.",

(Bt and Btk horizons)\nDuripan - the zone of silica cementation from 21 to 41 inches with indurated cap. (Bkqm1 and Bkqm2 horizons)\nParticle size control section - the zone from 8 to 21 inches.\nThe classification is based on the \"Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eighth Edition, 1998\".
