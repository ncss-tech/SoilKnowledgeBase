The soils are usually moist but are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay and has 45 to 80 percent rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 14 to 20 inches.  Soil reaction is very strongly or strongly acid throughout.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 14 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly sandy clay loam with 20 to 25 percent clay.  It has 25 to 35 percent gravel, 5 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 3 percent stones.\nThe AB horizon has color similar to the A horizon.  It is very cobbly sandy clay loam with 27 to 30 percent clay.  It has 25 to 30 percent gravel, 15 to 25 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very cobbly sandy clay loam, extremely cobbly sandy clay loam, or extremely cobbly clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 25 to 50 percent gravel, 25 to 30 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sankey soils occur in open grassland areas on metastable ridgetops and south-facing side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types of the Dothan Formation.   Elevations are 300 to 3,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 130 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 210 days."

Averlande, Hazelcamp and Skookumhouse soils are on ridgetops of mountains and have argillic horizons.  Hazelcamp and Skookumhouse soils are clayey and have a paralithic bedrock contact.  Bravo, Cassiday and Fritsland soils are on side slopes of mountains.  Bravo and Cassiday soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock and have ochric epipedons. Bravo soils are fine-loamy.  Fritsland soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock, have an ochric epipedon and are fine-loamy.  Grouslous soils are on steep side slopes of mountains have an ochric epipedon. Quailprairie soils are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock and are fine-loamy.  Swedeheaven soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. Quailprairie and Swedeheaven soils occur in open grassland areas on ridgetops and south-facing side slopes of mountains."
