    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Soil reaction of the organic material is less than 4.5 in 0.01M calcium chloride and ranges from 4.5 to 5.5 by the Hellige-Truog method.  The mineral material is extremely acid through moderately acid.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 4 or less.  The fiber content in the organic portion of the control section is less than 33 percent, unrubbed, or if more than 33 percent, its content is less than 16 percent of its volume after rubbing.  Sodium pyrophosphate extract has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 4 or less; value of 5, and chroma of 2 to 8; value of 6, and chroma of 3 to 8; or value of 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.\nThe Cg1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2; or hue of 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2; or it is neutral (N) with value of 2 or 3.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine san, mucky sand, mucky fine sand, mucky loamy sand or mucky loamy fine sand.\nThe Cg2 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2; or it is neutral (N) with value of 5 to 7.  Some pedons have mottles or streaks of lighter or darker colors.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Series in closely related families are the Dare, Dorovan, Ocoee, Okeelanta, Pamlico, Ponzer, Terra Ceia, and Tomoka series.  Dare, Dorovan, Pamlico, and Ponzer soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 72 degrees F. or less at depths of 20 inches below the surface.  In addition, Dare and Dorovan soils lack mineral layers within depths of 51 inches and Ponzer soils have loamy material within the control section.  Ocoee soils are dominated by more fibrous materials.  Okeelanta soils are less acid.  Terra Ceia soils have sapric materials to depths of more than 51 inches and are less acid.  Tomoka soils have loamy layers within the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Samsula soils are in freshwater swamps, depressions, and poorly defined drainageways.  Slope gradients are less than 2 percent.  They have formed in moderately thick beds of hydrophytic non-woody plant remains underlain by sandy marine sediments.   Rainfall is about 50 to 60 inches annually; mean annual air temperature is about 70 to 74 degrees F."

The water table is at or above surface of the soil except during extended dry periods.  In drained areas, a water control system regulates the water table according to plant needs."
