  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Soils are moist in winter and spring.  They are warmer than 41 degrees F from April 15 to November 1, and they are dry within this period after July 15.  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  There is a clay increase of 15 to 25 percent between the 2A and 3Bt horizons.  Carbonates are present in some pedons at depths below 40 inches.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 1 or 2 dry and moist.  It is fine sandy loam, silt loam or gravelly coarse sand.  The gravelly coarse sand is about 60 percent pumiceous ash and is up to 7 inches thick.\nThe 2A horizon has value of 7 or 8 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry and moist.  This horizon is considered an ash deposit from Newberry Crater.\nThe 3Bt horizon has value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  The upper part of this horizon commonly has uncoated sand and silt grains and tongues of 2A horizon.  Structure is prismatic or columnar.  Gravel content is 0 to 5 percent.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe 3C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry is silty clay loam or clay loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline."

Freznik soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.  Zoesta soils have lime at 10 to 20 inches and have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the lower parts of the Bt.  Coglin soils have soft powdery secondary lime accumulations at 10 to 30 inches and are on tablelands."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Swaler soils are in old lakebeds and low terraces around lakebeds at elevations of 4,100 to 5,700 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed mostly in clayey lacustrine sediment.  The climate is characterized by cold moist winters and cool dry summers.   The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F, average January temperature is 27 to 29 degrees F, and average July temperature is 59 to 61 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
