    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are dry more than one-half the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F (about 105 to 130 days), but are moist in winter and early spring.  Depth to the duripan is 10 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 10 to 35 percent rock fragments, 5 to 18 percent clay and 30 to 60 percent sand most of which is fine or very fine sand size.  Rock fragments consists mostly of basalt and indurated duripan fragments.  The duripan is 4 inches to several feet thick and overlies weakly consolidated gravel and sand alluvial deposits or weakly consolidated lacustrine deposits or overlying basalt at 30 or more inches.  Depth to secondary carbonates when present is 10 to 14 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  It is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam and can be gravelly.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam and has 10 to 35 percent coarse fragments, mostly pebbles.  When present, it has 5 to 30 percent calcium carbonate."

Arritola soils 25 to 35 percent clay.  Besslen soils have a calcic horizon with over 15 percent calcium carbonate and have a mean annual soil temperature of 49 to 53 degrees F.  Chiara soils have less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser, and are virtually free of rock fragments above the duripan.  Frohman soils have less than 10 percent rock fragments in the Bk Horizon.  Minveno and Yahoo soils have less than 15 percent very fine sand or coarser and less than 10 percent coarse fragments.  Nevoyer soils have a lithic contact at a depth of less than 20 inches.  Otoole soils are somewhat poorly drained, and have a high exchangeable sodium content.  Peeko and Plegomir soils lack a Bw horizon, have 18 to 27 percent clay and have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 53 degrees F.  Tenvorrd soils are 18 to 25 percent clay and less than 5 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Yahoo soils have 20 to 30 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Truvar soils have a strongly cemented duripan and have 50 to 70 percent medium and coarse sand in the particle-size control section.  Coltroop soils have 20 to 30 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 52 degrees F."

The soils formed in loess and silty alluvium mantling a duripan. They are in an arid climate with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 49 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 135 to 210 days in Washington and 100 to 140 days in Idaho."

Roza soils on old alluvial fans, Shano, and Starbuck soils lack a duripan.  Also, Shano soils on uplands are coarse-silty and Starbuck soils on benches and hillslopes have a lithic contact at 10 to 20 inches."
