  "STATES": "ID,MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Selle series consists of very deep, well drained soils on dune-like glaciolacustrine terraces. They formed in sandy glaciolacustrine or shoreline sediments with minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface layers. Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part and rapid below. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 750 mm, and average annual air temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",
