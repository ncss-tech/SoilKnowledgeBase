  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Spicer series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in silty glacial lacustrine sediments or loess on glacial lake plains and loess-mantled uplands.  These soils have moderate permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 47 percent F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 12 to 24 inches in thickness.  Typically free carbonates are in all parts with the calcium carbonate equivalent ranging from about 5 to 20 percent.  Some pedons have calcic horizons below a depth of 16 inches.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline in all horizons.  The profile does not typically have rock fragments.   Some pedons have loam or clay loam glacial till below depths of 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1.  It typically is silty clay loam or silt loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam or silty clay loam."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Spicer soils have slightly concave through slightly convex slopes with gradient of less than 2 percent.  They are on glacial lake plains and loess-covered uplands.  Spicer soils formed in Late Wisconsin Age loess or silty lacustrine sediments.  The climate is humid midcontinental with warm summers and cold winters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 45 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 26 to 33 inches."

The very poorly drained Afton and Okoboji soils are in depressions.  The poorly drained Madelia and Marcus soils are on flats, they are leached of free carbonates to greater depths.  The well-drained Galva, Truman, and Sac soils are on higher lying terrain.  The moderately well to somewhat poorly drained Kingston soils are common associates on slightly higher terrain."
