  "OVERVIEW": "The Sunray Series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy, calcareous eolian sediments of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping eolian plains or gently sloping draws.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 496 mm (19 in) and the mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
