The slope gradient is typically 2 to 18 percent, but ranges from 0 to 70 percent. Spinks soils formed in sandy eolian or outwash material. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 940 mm (29 to 37 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 10.0 degrees C (47 to 50 degrees F)."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The Spinks soils are the well drained member of a drainage sequence that includes the somewhat poorly drained Thetford soils. They are associated with the Boyer and Oshtemo soils on lake plains or outwash plains, and the Oakville or Chelsea soils on either lake plains or moraines. Dryden, Lapeer, Metea, Ottokee, and Owosso soils are on adjoining till plains or moraines. The Spinks soils are associated with the Granby, Ottokee, and Tedrow soils on lake plains in MLRA 99. The very poorly drained Granby soils are in depressions and the somewhat poorly drained Tedrow soils are on flats or slight rises. These soils do not have lamellae within the series control section. The moderately well drained Ottokee soils are on lower or less sloping landform positions and have less than 15 cm (6 inches) of lamellae within the series control section."

Pedons that have been correlated as a bedrock substratum phase, with a 2Cr horizon of sandstone or a 2R of limestone below 102 cm (40 inches), will become a new series during modernization projects. The stony surface phase over bedrock will also be correlated as a new series during modernization projects.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 56 cm (22 inches) (Ap and E horizons).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 56 to 216 cm (22 to 85 inches) (Bt part of E and Bt horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
