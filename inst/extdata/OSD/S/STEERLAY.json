    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Steerlay soils are on outwash fans and stream terraces. They typically occur on summit positions. They formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources such as igneous and metamorphic rock. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,950 to 2,015 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 350 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
