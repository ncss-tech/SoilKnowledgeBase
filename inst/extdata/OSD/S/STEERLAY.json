  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Steerlay series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from glacial outwash materials derived from mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks. Steerlay soils are on outwash fans and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

They formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources such as igneous and metamorphic rock. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,950 to 2,015 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 350 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
