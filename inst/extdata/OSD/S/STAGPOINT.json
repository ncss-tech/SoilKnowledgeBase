  "OVERVIEW": "The Stagpoint series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in tephra influenced colluvium and residuum from metamorphic rocks.  Stagpoint soils are on ridge tops and side slopes on metamorphic Sierra Nevada mountains.  Slopes range from 2 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 78 inches, (1981 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F, (9 degrees C).",
