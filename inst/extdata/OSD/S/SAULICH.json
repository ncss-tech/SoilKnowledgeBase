    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the organic mat ranges from 8 to 16 inches. Depth to the permafrost table ranges from 16 to 30 inches and is inversely related to the thickness of the O horizons.  Texture throughout the profile is silt loam or very fine sandy loam with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Substantial mica is present in the profile but less than 40 percent by weight.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid in the organic mat to slightly acid in the mineral horizons above the permafrost.\nThe O horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value moist from 2 to 4; and chroma moist from 1 to 3.  Texture is peat or mucky peat. Reaction is extremely acid to slightly acid\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y; value moist of 2 to 4; and chroma moist from 1 to 3. Texture is silt loam or mucky silt loam. Streaks of darker colored organic and mineral material are often present. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral\nThe B horizon has hue from 10YR to 5Y; value moist from 3 to 5; and chroma moist from 1 to 4. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; value moist from 3 to 5; and chroma moist from 1 to 3.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral."
