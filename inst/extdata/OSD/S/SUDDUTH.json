  "OVERVIEW": "The Sudduth series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in polylithologic materials derived from sedimentary rocks and consist of a fine textured lower section overlain by coarser material.  Sudduth soils are on alluvial fans, and concave drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
