  "STATES": "MD,VA",
  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Stumptown series are moderately deep well drained with moderately rapid permeability.  They formed partly in slope creep and partly in residuum that weathered from interbedded quartzite, quartz muscavite schist and phyllite of the Blue Ridge Anticlinorium.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

Rock fragments of quartzite gravel, cobbles, and flagstones ranges from 35 to 60 percent in the solum and up to 90 percent in the C horizon.  From 0 to 15 percent of the surface area is covered with stones and boulders up to 36 inches in diameter.  This soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 1 through 3.  Texture is loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Mottling in shades of red and yellow is common in the lower part of some pedons.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon is variegated in shades of yellow, brown, red and white.  It is loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe 2Cr is interbedded quartzite and partially weathered quartz muscovite schist.\nThe 2R is hard bedrock interbedded quartzite and quartz muscovite schist."
