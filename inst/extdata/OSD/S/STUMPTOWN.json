  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 12 to 30 inches.  Depth to 2 Cr horizon is from 20 to 40 inches and depth to bedrock is from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments of quartzite gravel, cobbles, and flagstones ranges from 35 to 60 percent in the solum and up to 90 percent in the C horizon.  From 0 to 15 percent of the surface area is covered with stones and boulders up to 36 inches in diameter.  This soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 1 through 3.  Texture is loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Mottling in shades of red and yellow is common in the lower part of some pedons.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon is variegated in shades of yellow, brown, red and white.  It is loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe 2Cr is interbedded quartzite and partially weathered quartz muscovite schist.\nThe 2R is hard bedrock interbedded quartzite and quartz muscovite schist."

These soils developed partly in local creep and partly in residuum that weathered from interbedded quartzite and quartz muscovite schist.  Slope ranges from 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 44 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 59 degrees F."
