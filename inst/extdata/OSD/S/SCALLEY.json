  "OVERVIEW": "The Scalley series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy till over sandy drift on ground moraines and end moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
