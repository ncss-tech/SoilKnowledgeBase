  "OVERVIEW": "The Scarpal series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over colluvium from basalt, rhyolite, pyroclastic tuffs and Mesozoic marine sediments on upland escarpments and steep, north and east-facing mountain sideslopes.  Slope gradients are 20 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches; mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
