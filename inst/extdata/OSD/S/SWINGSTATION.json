  "OVERVIEW": "The Swingstation series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and/or slope alluvium derived from sedimentary rock.  These soils are on hillslopes, fan aprons and drainageways. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 275 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 5.0 degrees C.",
