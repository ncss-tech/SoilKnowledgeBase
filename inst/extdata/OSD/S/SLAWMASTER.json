The epipedon fails the moisture criterion of the mollic epipedon required characteristics due to lack of adequate moisture during the growing season.\nAB horizon\nHue: 10YR or 2.5Y.\nValue: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.\nChroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist.\nTexture: Ashy silt loam or ashy silty clay loam; some pedons have texture of ashy very fine sandy loam.\nReaction:  Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nVolcanic glass content: 15 to 35 percent in coarse silt through fine sand fractions.\nOxalate aluminum plus one-half oxalate iron: 0.1 to 0.4 percent.\nEffervescence:  Very slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent.\nOther features: Some pedons have identifiable secondary carbonates in the form of masses in the matrix.\nBk horizons\nHue: 10YR or 2.5Y.\nValue: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.\nChroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist.\nTexture: Silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, ashy silty clay loam, or ashy silt loam.\nClay content: 18 to 35 percent.\nReaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nSalinity (EC): 0 to 4 mmhos/cm.\nSodicity (SAR): 5 to 13.\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 4 percent.\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates: Occurs as masses in the matrix or coats on faces of peds; carbonate concretions occur in some pedons and may be relict groundwater features.\nVolcanic glass content: 5 to 15 percent in coarse silt through fine sand fractions.\nOxalate aluminum plus one-half oxalate iron: 0.1 to 0.4 percent.\nOther features: Some pedons have few moderately cemented iron-manganese concretions; 10 to 30 percent biotite mica in the fine sand fraction by grain count.\n2C horizon (when present)\nTexture: Stratified gravelly coarse sand to ashy silty clay loam."

Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,220 to 1,280 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."
