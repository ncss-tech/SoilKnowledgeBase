  "OVERVIEW": "The Slawmaster series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Slawmaster soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
