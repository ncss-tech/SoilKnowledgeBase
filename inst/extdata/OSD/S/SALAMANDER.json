  "REVDATE": "02/2007",
  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Salamander series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in thin eolian material over old alluvium derived from igneous material and shale.  Salamander soils are on paleoterrace.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
