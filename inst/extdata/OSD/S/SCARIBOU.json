  "OVERVIEW": "The Scaribou series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from nonmarine sediments or metavolcanics.  Scaribou soils are on mountainsides.  Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
