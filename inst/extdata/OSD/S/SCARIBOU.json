The moisture control section (19 to 53 inches) is dry from August 1 to November 1 (90 days) and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the time.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from May 1 to December 1 and exceeds 47 degrees F from June 1 to November 1.  Rock fragments on the surface range from 0 to 50 percent stones and 20 to 40 percent gravel.\nThe A horizon dry color is 7.5YR 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 6/4 or 6/6.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/2, 4/4 or 4/6.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly loam, stony loam or extremely stony loam.\nThe BA horizon dry color is 7.5YR 5/4, 6/4, 6/6, 7/4 or 5 YR 6/6.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6 or 5 YR 4/6.
