  "OVERVIEW": "The Scudder series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, slide deposits derived from limestone and other calcareous sedimentary rock.  These soils occur on hills, mountain slopes, and debris avalanches.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 480 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
