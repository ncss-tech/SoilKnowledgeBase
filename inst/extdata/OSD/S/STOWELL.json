  "OVERVIEW": "The Stowell series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits derived from the Beaumont Formation. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils occur on relict beach ridges of coastal plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1397 mm (55 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 20.5 degrees C (degrees 69 F).",
