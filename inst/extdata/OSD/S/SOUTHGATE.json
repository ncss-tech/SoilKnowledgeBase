Cramer, Dorothea,  Fredriksdal, Jealousy, Maho Bay, Susannaberg, and Victory soils are on similar landscapes.  In addition, Cramer soils have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Dorothea, Fredriksdal, and Susannaberg soils have vermiculitic mineralogy.  Jealousy soils have smectitic mineralogy and are moderately deep to bedrock.  Maho bay soils have a mollic epepedon.  Parasol soils are on slightly lower positions, are very deep, and have smectitic mineralogy.  Victory soils are moderately deep to bedrock."
