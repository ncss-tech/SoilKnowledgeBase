  "OVERVIEW": "The Southgate series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils on summits and side slopes of volcanic hills and mountains.  They formed in material weathered from igneous bedrock.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 80 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.  Slopes range from 2 to 90 percent.",

Cramer, Dorothea,  Fredriksdal, Jealousy, Maho Bay, Susannaberg, and Victory soils are on similar landscapes.  In addition, Cramer soils have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Dorothea, Fredriksdal, and Susannaberg soils have vermiculitic mineralogy.  Jealousy soils have smectitic mineralogy and are moderately deep to bedrock.  Maho bay soils have a mollic epepedon.  Parasol soils are on slightly lower positions, are very deep, and have smectitic mineralogy.  Victory soils are moderately deep to bedrock."
