  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness exceeds 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid through very strongly acid in the surface layers except in limed areas, and from strongly acid through extremely acid in lower horizons.  Depth to the fragipan is 15 to 41 inches.  Chert content of the horizons above the fragipan ranges from 15 to 35 percent, in the fragipan ranges from 30 to 80 percent, and below the fragipan 15 to 50 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is cherty loam, cherty sandy loam, or cherty silt loam.\nThe B1 horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 or 6.  The B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Some pedons are mottled with shades of brown.  Texture of the B horizon is cherty loam, or cherty silt loam.  In some pedons thin subhorizons have texture of silty clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Bx horizon is mottled in shades of gray, yellow, brown, and red, and some pedons have a brown or yellow matrix color.  Texture is cherty loam, cherty silt loam, cherty clay loam, cherty sandy clay loam, or cherty silty clay loam.\nThe B3 horizon has the same colors and textures as the Bx horizon."
