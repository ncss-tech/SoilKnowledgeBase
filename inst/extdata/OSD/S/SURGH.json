    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 39 to 41 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice. The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.60 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 65 percent rock fragments, 0 to 15 percent paragravel consisting of shist or gneiss fragments and 5 to 10 percent clay.  The depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.\nThe C horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry and moist.  It is ashy fine sandy loam, gravelly ashy fine sandy loam, stony ashy sandy loam, cobbly ashy sandy loam, gravelly ashy sandy loam or very bouldery ashy fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 3Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is extremely gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly fine sandy loam, very cobbly sandy loam, very cobbly coarse sandy loam, very stony coarse sandy loam or very stony sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 3C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from granite, gneiss or schist, with a mantle of volcanic ash.  They are in a climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 25 to 40 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 20 degrees F.; mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F; mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F. is about 60 to 140 days."
