  "OVERVIEW": "The Swansea series consists of very poorly drained organic soils.  They formed in 40 to 130 centimeters of highly decomposed organic material over sandy mineral.  These soils are in depressions or on flat level areas on uplands and outwash plains.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the organic material and very high in the substratum. The mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees Celsius and the mean annual precipitation is about 1143 millimeters.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the Cg horizon is 40 to 130 centimeters.  Cumulative layers of hemic materials comprise less than 25 centimeters and fibric materials less than 12 centimeters of the subsurface and bottom tiers.  Woody fragments are in some part of the organic material in most pedons and comprise up to 25 percent of some horizons. Fragments consist of twigs, branches, logs, or stumps and are 2 centimeters to more than 30 centimeters in diameter.  Woody fragments are firm but break abruptly under pressure.  Reaction is less than 4.5 in 0.01 molar calcium chloride throughout the organic material.\nThe surface tier has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  In some pedons the chroma ranges to 4. It is dominantly sapric material; however, in some pedons it has various proportions of both sapric and hemic materials or has fibric materials.  It has weak or moderate, fine or medium, granular or subangular blocky structure or it is massive.  Some pedons have a mineral surface layer of sand or coarse sand that is 10 to 25 centimeters thick.\nThe subsurface and bottom tiers, above the C horizon, have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 3.  Chroma or value or both may change from 0.5 to 2 units upon rubbing.  Broken faces become darker upon brief exposure to air.  The subsurface tier is dominated by sapric material with a rubbed fiber content of less than 16 percent of the organic volume. The subsurface and bottom tiers have platy structure or are massive. They are very friable or friable.  Unrubbed organic material resembles herbaceous and woody plant tissues.\nThe C or Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Redoximorphic features are present in some pedons.  It ranges from coarse sand to loamy fine sand and their gravelly analogs but may include some finer-textured lenses or horizons in some pedons.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 45 percent and is commonly gravel but includes cobbles in some pedons. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid."

The somewhat poorly and poorly drained Ridgebury soils and the very poorly drained Whitman and Scarboro soils formed in glacial till are adjacent to areas of Swansea soils."

Lithic discontinuity - there is a significant change in particle size at a depth of 66 centimeters (Cg1 horizon).\n3. Sapric material from 0 to 66 centimeters (Oa horizons)\n4. Histic epipedon from 0 to 33 centimeters\n5. Aquic conditions 0 to 165 centimeters\n6.
