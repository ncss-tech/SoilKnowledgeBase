  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the Cg horizon is 40 to 130 centimeters.  Cumulative layers of hemic materials comprise less than 25 centimeters and fibric materials less than 12 centimeters of the subsurface and bottom tiers.  Woody fragments are in some part of the organic material in most pedons and comprise up to 25 percent of some horizons. Fragments consist of twigs, branches, logs, or stumps and are 2 centimeters to more than 30 centimeters in diameter.  Woody fragments are firm but break abruptly under pressure.  Reaction is less than 4.5 in 0.01 molar calcium chloride throughout the organic material.\nThe surface tier has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  In some pedons the chroma ranges to 4. It is dominantly sapric material; however, in some pedons it has various proportions of both sapric and hemic materials or has fibric materials.  It has weak or moderate, fine or medium, granular or subangular blocky structure or it is massive.  Some pedons have a mineral surface layer of sand or coarse sand that is 10 to 25 centimeters thick.\nThe subsurface and bottom tiers, above the C horizon, have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 3.  Chroma or value or both may change from 0.5 to 2 units upon rubbing.  Broken faces become darker upon brief exposure to air.  The subsurface tier is dominated by sapric material with a rubbed fiber content of less than 16 percent of the organic volume. The subsurface and bottom tiers have platy structure or are massive. They are very friable or friable.  Unrubbed organic material resembles herbaceous and woody plant tissues.\nThe C or Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Redoximorphic features are present in some pedons.  It ranges from coarse sand to loamy fine sand and their gravelly analogs but may include some finer-textured lenses or horizons in some pedons.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 45 percent and is commonly gravel but includes cobbles in some pedons. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid."

The Makinen soils receive less than 813 millimeters of mean annual precipitation and have less gravel in the substratum.\nFreetown and Paupack are similar soils in related families.  Freetown soils have organic layers greater than 130 centimeters.  Paupack soils are underlain by loamy skeletal or clayey skeletal mineral material."

They are on outwash plains, till plains and moraines.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees Celsius and mean annual precipitation is 1016 to 1270 millimeters.  The frost-free period is 120 to 180 days."

Freetown soils are on similar landscapes and have more than 130 centimeters of organic material.  The excessively drained Hinckley and Windsor soils are on nearby outwash landforms. The somewhat poorly and poorly drained Ridgebury soils and the very poorly drained Whitman and Scarboro soils formed in glacial till are adjacent to areas of Swansea soils."

The Type Location is pedon T1MA603018, also the typical pedon for the soil survey of Bristol County, MA, Southern Part.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\n1. Terric feature - mineral soil from a depth of 66 to 165 centimeters (2Cg horizons).\n2. Lithic discontinuity - there is a significant change in particle size at a depth of 66 centimeters (Cg1 horizon).\n3. Sapric material from 0 to 66 centimeters (Oa horizons)\n4. Histic epipedon from 0 to 33 centimeters\n5. Aquic conditions 0 to 165 centimeters\n6. Endosaturation 0 to 165 centimeters\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
