  "OVERVIEW": "The Southam series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in local alluvium from glacial drift.  These soils are in basins and depressions on till plains, moraines and lake plains.  Slope is 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 41 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 17 inches.",

The 10- to 40-inch particle size control section averages between 35 to 50 percent clay. Depth to carbonates ranges from 0 to 10 inches. The electrical conductivity ranges from less than 2 to 8 mmhos/cc. It typically does not have coarse fragments but some pedons contain as much as 10 percent in some horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  It typically is silty clay loam or silty clay, but the range includes clay loam and clay.  In some pedons the surface layer is silt loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a 2A or AC horizon or both.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, 5GY or is neutral, value of 3 to 7 and 4 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  Some pedons do not have prominent mottles.  It typically is silty clay, but the range includes silty clay loam, clay loam and clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a 2C horizon."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Revised 5/94.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 40 inches (Ag horizons); vertic subgroup criteria - LE of more than 6 cm in the upper 1 meter.\nThis soil competes with the Oldham series based only on duration of ponding and depth to saturation. Additional studies are needed in the future to see if both series are needed, or if ponded and drained phases of one of these series would be appropriate.\nThe soil is from the deep marsh vegetative zone of a Class IV wetland as defined by Stewart and Kantrud, 1971 in Resource Publication 92.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Bigler, R. J.  Correlation of Wetland Soils and Plants, M.S. Thesis - N.D.S.U.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
