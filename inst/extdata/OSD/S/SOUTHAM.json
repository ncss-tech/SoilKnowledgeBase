  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 24 to more than 60 inches thick. Some pedons have an 0 horizon as much as 6 inches thick. The 10- to 40-inch particle size control section averages between 35 to 50 percent clay. Depth to carbonates ranges from 0 to 10 inches. The electrical conductivity ranges from less than 2 to 8 mmhos/cc. It typically does not have coarse fragments but some pedons contain as much as 10 percent in some horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  It typically is silty clay loam or silty clay, but the range includes clay loam and clay.  In some pedons the surface layer is silt loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a 2A or AC horizon or both.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, 5GY or is neutral, value of 3 to 7 and 4 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  Some pedons do not have prominent mottles.  It typically is silty clay, but the range includes silty clay loam, clay loam and clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a 2C horizon."

All these soils, except Parnell, formed in loam or clay loam glacial till.  Barnes and Forman soils are well drained; Aastad, Hamlet and Svea soils are moderately well drained; Hamerly soils are moderately well and somewhat poorly drained; and Vallers soils are poorly drained.  Parnell soils have an argillic horizon."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",

A seasonal high water table is at a depth of 5.0 feet above the surface to 1.0 foot below the surface throughout the year.  The soils are usually ponded continuously throughout the growing season.  Only in some dry years is the soil surface exposed."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Revised 5/94.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 40 inches (Ag horizons); vertic subgroup criteria - LE of more than 6 cm in the upper 1 meter.\nThis soil competes with the Oldham series based only on duration of ponding and depth to saturation. Additional studies are needed in the future to see if both series are needed, or if ponded and drained phases of one of these series would be appropriate.\nThe soil is from the deep marsh vegetative zone of a Class IV wetland as defined by Stewart and Kantrud, 1971 in Resource Publication 92.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Bigler, R. J.  Correlation of Wetland Soils and Plants, M.S. Thesis - N.D.S.U.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
