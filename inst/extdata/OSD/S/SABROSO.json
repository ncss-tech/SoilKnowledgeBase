  "OVERVIEW": "The Sabroso series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in colluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Sabroso soils are on backslopes of south-facing plateaus and mesas.  Slopes are 35 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
