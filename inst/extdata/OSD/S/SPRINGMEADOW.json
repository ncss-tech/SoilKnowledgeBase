  "OVERVIEW": "The Springmeadow series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and reworked lacustrine deposits. Springmeadow soils are on stream terraces and flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
