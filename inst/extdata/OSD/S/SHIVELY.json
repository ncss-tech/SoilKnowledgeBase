  "OVERVIEW": "The Shively series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from tuffaceous sandstone, rhyolite and welded tuffs.  Shively soils are on concave mountain and hill side slopes with northerly aspects.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
