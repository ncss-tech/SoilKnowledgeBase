These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from tuffaceous sandstone, rhyolite and welded tuffs.   Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,830 to 2,500 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual temperature is about 6 to 7 degrees C; the average annual precipitation is 360 to 460 mm, and the frost-free season is 60 to 100 days."
