  "OVERVIEW": "The Skunkfarm series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed igneous rock sources. The Skunkfarm soils are in depressions on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Distinct redoximorphic iron accumulations are present in the lower part of the mollic epipedon and subsoil.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 moist in the upper part and 2 or 3 moist in the lower part.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, or loam with 25 to 35 percent clay.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has a value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam or silty clay loam with 15 to 30 percent clay.
