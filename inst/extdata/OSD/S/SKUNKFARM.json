The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay, and greater than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Distinct redoximorphic iron accumulations are present in the lower part of the mollic epipedon and subsoil.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 moist in the upper part and 2 or 3 moist in the lower part.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, or loam with 25 to 35 percent clay.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has a value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam or silty clay loam with 15 to 30 percent clay.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has a value of 5 or 6 dry.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nCOMPETING SERIES.  These are the Bluffton, Flom, Larry, and Mahtowa series.  Bluffton soils and Flom soils are on glacial landscapes and have free carbonates at a depth of about 15 to 45 inches.  Larry soils have chroma of 0 or 1 in the mollic epipedon and have 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 5 to 25 percent gravel.  Mahtowa soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the subsoil and substratum."
