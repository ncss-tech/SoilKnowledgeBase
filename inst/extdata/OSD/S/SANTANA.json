    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon:  0 to 12 inches\nLithic contact:  12 inches\nThe classification was changed to an Aridic Lithic subgroup in 2007.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.\nThe series was revised ATS: 7/25/44; and AJC: 3/5/63; however, it was not used in a published soil survey and sufficient acreage was not recognized in Sierra County to use in the final correlation of that county.  Therefore, the type location was moved to Grant County, New Mexico in 5/79 by JBC and the concept of the series changed somewhat from that set forth in the description AJC: 3/5/63.  The typical pedon appeared to be skeletal; however, the classification is nonskeletal.  The present concept is a warmer soil and one that is gravelly in places but is nonskeletal.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
