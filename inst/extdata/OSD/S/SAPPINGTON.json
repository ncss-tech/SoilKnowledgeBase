  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sappington series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium, slope alluvium, colluvium or outwash.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants, knolls, outwash plains and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and mean annual air temperatures is about 43 degrees F.",
