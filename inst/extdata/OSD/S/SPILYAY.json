  "OVERVIEW": "The Spilyay series consists of very deep, well drained soils on foot slopes of canyons.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from semi-consolidated conglomerate and volcanic tuff with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

It has 10 to 15 percent clay and contains 20 to 30 percent cobbles and 15 to 25 percent gravel of which 5 to 10 percent is pumice.  It has 30 to 40 percent volcanic glass and glass coated aggregate including 0.5 to 2 mm diameter pumice, and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.2 to 0.8 percent .  Soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.
