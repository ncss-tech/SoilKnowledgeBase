    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days within the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick and may include the upper part of the 2Bt horizon.  The particle-size control section is 35 to 55 percent field estimated clay and has 0 to 10 percent gravel.  There is a 20 to 30 percent absolute clay increase at the upper boundary of the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 10 to 15 percent clay and contains 20 to 30 percent cobbles and 15 to 25 percent gravel of which 5 to 10 percent is pumice.  It has 30 to 40 percent volcanic glass and glass coated aggregate including 0.5 to 2 mm diameter pumice, and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.2 to 0.8 percent .  Soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam in the upper part of the 2Bt and clay in the lower part with clay ranging from 35 to 55 percent.  It contains 0 to 10 percent  gravel.

Driscoll soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days, have a buried argillic horizon, and are moderately well drained.  Nawt soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock and have a Bk horizon.  Torney soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the 2Bt horizon and secondary carbonates in the substratum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Spilyay soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep foot slopes of canyons.  The soil formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from semi-consolidated conglomerate and volcanic tuff with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 2200 to 3400 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

Evick soils are on adjacent steep south-facing side slopes of canyons, loamy, and 10 to 14 inches to volcanic tuff.  Happus soils are on south-facing toe slopes of canyons, are ashy-pumiceous, and moderately deep to fragmental pumice."
