  "OVERVIEW": "The Shellabarger series consists of very deep, well drained soils on paleoterraces in river valleys formed in loamy alluvium in the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 700 mm (28 in.) and the mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C (57 degrees F) at the type location.",
