  "OVERVIEW": "The Sancarlos series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes. These soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone, siltstone, and/or metasedimentary rock. Slope is 25 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 46 centimeters (18 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C. (57 degrees F).",
