  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is more than 80 inches.  Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 40 to 70 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 18 to 34 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 3 percent in the A, E, Bw, and Bx/E horizons and from 0 to 10 percent in the Btx horizons.  Where present, the 2Bt or 2C horizon ranges from 5 to 60 percent fragments.  Reaction in each horizon ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid, except where limed.\nThe A and Ap horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. Some pedons have A horizons with value of 3 and chroma of 3 or less and are less than 8 inches thick. Texture is silt loam or rarely silt.\nThe E horizon, where present, and the E part of the Bx/E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is silt loam or rarely silt.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 5 or 6, and chromas of 3 to 6.  Some pedons have redoximorphic features with chroma of 2 or less in the lower few inches of the Bw horizon.  Texure is silt loam.\nThe Bx/E or E/Bx horizon has colors similar to the E and Bw horizons.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 4 to 6, and chromas of 4 or 6. Common to many redoximorphic features are in shades of gray, brown, black, red, and yellow.  Some pedons are an evenly mottled pattern without a dominant matrix color.  Texture is commonly silt loam throughout, but some pedons are silty clay loam in the lower part.\nThe 2Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Few to many redoximorphic features are in shades of brown, gray, black, red, and yellow.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Soils in closely related families are the Teddy and Sango series.  The Teddy soils are in a fine-loamy particle size class.  The Sango soils are in a thermic temperature regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sano soils are on nearly level to undulating uplands and in slight depressions.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Some areas in slight depressions are ponded for short periods.  The soils formed in a silty mantle, presumably loess, ranging from 40 to 70 inches in thickness underlain by residuum of limestone or sandstone or old alluvium containing more clay than the silty mantle.  Near the type location, mean annual temperature is 56.4 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 52.3 inches."

The Teddy soils are in more sloping landscape positions and have more sand in the control section.  The Christian, Frederick, Frankstown, and Pricetown soils are well drained and on more rolling landscape positions."
