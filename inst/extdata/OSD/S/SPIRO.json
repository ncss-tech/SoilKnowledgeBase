    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to bedrock and thickness of solum range from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid.\nSome pedons have a BA horizon, and where present, the BA horizon is similar to the Bt horizon in color and texture, but the reaction is medium acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam and the clay content averages between 18 and 35 percent.  Reaction is medium acid to very strongly acid.\nThe BC horizon has color, texture, and reaction similar to the Bt horizon but contains shale fragments.  Fragments of shale, siltstone, or sandstone less than 76mm in diameter comprise 10 to 80 percent of the volume.\nThe Cr horizon is interbedded shale, siltstone, and sandstone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Rexor series in the same family and the Armour, Barnsdall, Dexter, Dossman, and Hicks, series in similar families.  Armour, Barnsdall, Dexter, Dossman, and Hicks soils have mixed mineralogy.  In addition, Barnsdall, Dexter and Dossman soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the matrix of the argillic horizon; Hicks soils are underlain by phosphatic limestone below depths of 42 inches.  Rexor soils lack bedrock within 60 inches of the soil surface."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Spiro soils are mainly on convex side slopes and ridges of uplands in the Arkansas Valley and Ridges and the Boston Mountains. Slopes are 1 to 8 percent but are dominantly less than 5 percent.  These soils formed in material weathered from residuum interbedded shale, siltstone, and sandstone of Pennsylvanian age.  The climate is humid. Mean average annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 46 inches; mean annual temperature ranges from 57 degrees to 65 degrees F; and Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 64 to 80."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",

Collinsville soils are on ridges in native grass areas and they have a mollic epipedon.  Enders soils are on convex side slopes in higher elevations and they have a clayey control section.  Hector soils are on similar positions to the Spiro series at higher elevations, and they are less than 20 inches thick over lithic sandstone.  Linker soils are on convex foot slopes, side slopes, and ridges and they have a fine-loamy control section.  Stigler soils are on similar areas to the Spiro series but have a thicker solum and have a clayey control section.  Vian soils are on similar areas to the Spiro series but have a thicker solum."
