  "REVDATE": "10/97",
  "STATES": "NH",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Squamscott series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in sandy materials overlying loamy sediments on marine or lacustrine plains or terraces.  Permeability is rapid in the upper part of the soil and moderately slow in the lower part.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Avoca and Rapson soils are from outside of Region R.  They both have free carbonates in the 2C horizons.  Coveytown, Enosburg, Shaker, and Swanton soils do not have spodic horizons.  In addition, Coveytown and Swanton soils have frigid temperature regimes."

The former classification was sandy over loamy, mixed, mesic Entic Haplaquods.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 2 to 4 inches (A horizon).\n2.  Albic horizon - the zone from 4 to 6 inches (E horizon).\n3.  Spodic horizons - the zone from 6 to 10 inches (Bhs and Bs1 horizons).\n4.  Strongly contrasting particle-size classes - loamy sand and fine sand textures from 12 to 21 inches and silt loam textures from 21 to 40 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
