The soil ranges from extremely acid through neutral, with acidity generally decreasing with depth.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent throughout the soil.  Structure is granular or subangular blocky in the solum.  The 2C horizon is massive or has angular blocky geologic structure.\nThe 0 horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 3.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have an Ap horizon that ranges from 4 to 10 inches thick.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy very fine sand.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in the same family.  The Avoca, Coveytown, Enosburg, Rapson, Shaker, and Swanton series in related families.  Avoca and Rapson soils are from outside of Region R.  They both have free carbonates in the 2C horizons.  Coveytown, Enosburg, Shaker, and Swanton soils do not have spodic horizons.  In addition, Coveytown and Swanton soils have frigid temperature regimes."

The former classification was sandy over loamy, mixed, mesic Entic Haplaquods.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 2 to 4 inches (A horizon).\n2.  Albic horizon - the zone from 4 to 6 inches (E horizon).\n3.  Spodic horizons - the zone from 6 to 10 inches (Bhs and Bs1 horizons).\n4.  Strongly contrasting particle-size classes - loamy sand and fine sand textures from 12 to 21 inches and silt loam textures from 21 to 40 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
