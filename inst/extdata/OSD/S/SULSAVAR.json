Chuckanut soils are 15 to 25 percent weathered sandstone in the particle-size control section.  Kickerville soils are very gravelly or extremely gravelly, sand or loamy sand in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Nati and Sehome soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Sauk soils have 0 to 10 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Squalicum soils are not stratified in the particle-size control section and have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches."

The soils formed in gravelly alluvium containing significant amounts of volcanic ash.  The average annual precipitation is 45 to 75 inches.  The mean January temperature is 33 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 59 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 46 degrees F.  The frost free season is 120 to 180 days."
