    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Selfridge soils are on moraines, relict nearshore zones, wave-worked till plains, till-floored lake plains, glacial deltas, and low sand dunes of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Selfridge soils formed in 51 to 100 cm of sandy material and the underlying loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 710 to 960 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C. Frost-free period is 130 to 210 days."

The somewhat poorly drained Tedrow soils are on similar landform positions and have sandy materials throughout the series control section. The poorly drained Brookston, the poorly and very poorly drained Belleville and Parkhill, and the very poorly drained Pewamo soils are in depressions. The excessively drained Oakville, the well drained Spinks, and the moderately well drained Brems soils are on higher rises and dunes and have sandy materials throughout the series control section."

Future evaluation is needed to verify the presence of densic material in other MLRAs where this series occurs.\nA stony surface phase is currently recognized in MLRA 99. Future evaluation is needed to place these soils into a more appropriate series concept.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab characterization data is available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
