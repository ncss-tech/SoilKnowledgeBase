  "OVERVIEW": "The Selfridge series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy material and the underlying loamy till on moraines, relict nearshore zones, wave-worked till plains, till-floored lake plains, glacial deltas, and low sand dunes. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 815 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Future evaluation is needed to verify the presence of densic material in other MLRAs where this series occurs.\nA stony surface phase is currently recognized in MLRA 99. Future evaluation is needed to place these soils into a more appropriate series concept.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab characterization data is available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
