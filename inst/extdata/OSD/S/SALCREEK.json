  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Salcreek soils are on backslopes and footslopes of mountains. Elevation ranges from 3,600 to 4,900 feet. These soils formed in glacial till and some colluvium from metasedimentary rock with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part. Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 24 inches. The mean January temperature is 22 to 26 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F.; and the mean annual air temperature is 40 to 43 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."

Buckhill soils are on backslopes, lack a mollic epipedon and have a 7 to 14 inch thick volcanic ash mantle. Coxit soils are on southerly aspects, lack a mollic epipedon and argillic horizon. Oxerine soils are on shoulders and upper backslopes and are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock. Nevine soils are on backslopes and foot slopes and have a 14 to 22 inch thick volcanic ash mantle."
