  "OVERVIEW": "The Salcreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial till and some colluvium from metasedimentary rock with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part. These soils are on backslopes and footslopes of mountains. Slopes are 15 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
