  "OVERVIEW": "The Stromal series consists of very deep, well drained,  soils that formed in calcareous alluvium and eolian materials. Stromal soils are on high terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
