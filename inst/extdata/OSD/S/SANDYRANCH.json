The Curtis Siding soil is inactive.  The Dwyer, Karval, Orpha, Tullock, Valent, and Wigton soils are moist in some part periodically during May and June, and reflect the soil forming conditions of the Great Plains.  Pensom soils are deep to sandstone.  The Calladito series is noneffervescent in the particle-size control section and is not periodically flooded.  The Pinavetes and Mido series do not have an irregular decrease in organic matter indicated by fine stratification and are not periodically flooded."

These soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches (229 to 330 mm) with high intensity thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F. (7.8 to 11.1 degrees C.).   The average frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Sandyranch soils, with a texture class of loamy fine sand or coarser in all layers within the particle-size control section, are too sandy to classify as Fluvents according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999 and Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010; they do, however, have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth as a result of their fluvial origin.\nThis is indicated by the fine stratification, most evident in the upper part of the soil profile; the presence of discontinuous lenses of gravel; and adjacent horizons often vary in the dominant sand fraction present.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nEntisol feature - lack of diagnostic horizons\nPsamment feature - less than 35 percent (by volume) rock fragments and a texture class of loamy fine sand or coarser in all layers within the particle-size control section\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
