The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 6 to 9 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 7 and 21 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to August 15 and is dry in some part from September 1 to October 1 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay.  Reaction is extremely or very strongly acid (pH 4.1 to 5.0).\nThe E horizon is 10YR 5/1, 6/1, 6/2, 7/2, 7/3 or 7/4.  Moist color is 10YR 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 6/1, 6/2 or 6/3.  Clay content ranges from 7 to 15 percent.  The horizon may be slightly smeary and may be slightly brittle when moist.  Iron nodules range from 2 to 15 percent and are 2 to 30 mm in diameter.\nThe BE horizon is 10YR 6/4, 6/6, 7/1, 7/4; 7.5YR 5/8 or 6/6. Moist colors are 10YR 5/4, 6/2, 6/6 or 6/8.  The horizon is often variegated. It is loam or sandy clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 10 to 27 percent.  The horizon may be slightly smeary and may be slightly brittle when moist.  Iron nodules range from 0 to 15 percent and are 2 to 40mm wide.\nThe Bt horizon is 5Y 6/1,7/1; 2.5Y 6/1, 7/1; 10YR 6/4, 6/6, 7/1, 7/2, 7/4 or 7/6.

Redox depletions (grayish colors) occur with redox concentrations (reddish colors) in a regularly occurring reticulate pattern.  This pattern occurs within a depth of 15 to 30 inches and continues to 60 inches or more.  It is loam, clay loam, clay, or sandy clay.  Clay content ranges from 20 to 60 percent.  The horizon contains 0 to 20 percent soft plinthite.  Iron nodules ranges from 0 to 15 percent and are 2 to 60 mm in size.  Base saturation (sum) ranges from 10 to 35 percent."
