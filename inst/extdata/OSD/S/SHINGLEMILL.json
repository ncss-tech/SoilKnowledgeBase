The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 6 to 9 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 7 and 21 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to August 15 and is dry in some part from September 1 to October 1 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay.  Reaction is extremely or very strongly acid (pH 4.1 to 5.0).\nThe E horizon is 10YR 5/1, 6/1, 6/2, 7/2, 7/3 or 7/4.
