  "OVERVIEW": "The Scully series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  These soils are on hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 cm (8 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C (41 degrees F).",
