  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the A horizon and moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the Bt and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or neutral, value of 2 or 3, chroma 2 or less.  Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or loam.  If fine sand or loamy fine sand, the horizon is 26 to 50 centimeters thick.\nSome pedons have a thin sandy loam or fine sandy loam BAg or BEg horizon with hue 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or less.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or neutral, value of 3 to 6, and chroma 2 or less.  Some are mottled with brown or yellow. Clay content ranges from 18 to 30 percent; silt content of this horizon is less than 20 percent.  Where color value is less than 4, organic matter content is less than 1 percent.  Common fine or medium soft calcium carbonate accumulations occur in the lower portion of this horizon in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value 4 to 7, chroma 1 or 2.  Texture is dominantly sand or loamy sand but includes stratified sandy clay, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or sand.  Some pedons are underlain with a 2Cg horizon of greenish gray marl."

Fellowship and Martel soils have mean annual soil temperature of more than 72 degrees F.  In addition, Fellowship and Martel soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy. Grifton soils have siliceous mineralogy and lack an umbric epipedon.  Stono soils have a mollic epipedon."

Organic carbon content of Btg1 is 0.31 percent (10YR 3/1).  Additional base saturation tests of A1 horizons of other pedons using a field test kit indicate base saturation of less than 50 percent.\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nFL0202 STOCKADE    0-  2     -        -       -         -\nFL0452 STOCKADE    0-  2     -        -       -         -\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nFL0202 NONE   RARE     0-1.0  APPARENT JUN-MAR  60-60\nFL0452 FREQ            0-1.0  APPARENT JUN-MAR  60-60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nFL0202  0-12  FSL L                   0-  0 100-100 10-15    -\nFL0202  0-12  LFS FS                  0-  0 100-100  6-12    -\nFL0202  0-12  MK-L MK-FSL MK-SL       0-  0 100-100 10-15    -\nFL0202 12-46  SCL FSL                 0-  0 100-100 18-30    -\nFL0202 46-65  VAR                      -       -      -      -\nFL0452  0-12  FSL L                   0-  0 100-100 10-15    -\nFL0452  0-12  LFS FS                  0-  0 100-100  6-12    -\nFL0452  0-12  MK-L MK-FSL MK-SL       0-  0 100-100 10-15    -\nFL0452 12-46  SCL FSL                 0-  0 100-100 18-30    -\nFL0452 46-65  VAR                      -       -      -      -\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
