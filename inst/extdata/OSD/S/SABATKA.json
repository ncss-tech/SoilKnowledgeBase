  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the cambic horizon ranges from 10 to 25 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 40 to 60 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine and coarser sand.  Dark soil colors are inherent from the parent material.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is clay loam, clay, silty clay loam, silty clay and silt loam.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  It is noncalcareous.  Some pedons have up to 25 percent channers on the surface.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is clay, clay loam, silty clay or silty clay loam.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 14 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.  The horizon is noncalcareous except for thin layers in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is clay, silty clay, clay loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.  It is noncalcareous except for thin layers in some pedons.  The horizon has 0 to 60 percent soft shale channers which break down on pretreatment with sodium hexametaphosphate, and 0 to 15 percent hard shale channers.  Angular blocky structure inherent to the parent material.  One to two percent gypsum inherent to the parent material occurs in some pedons.\nThe Cr horizon is nonacid shale, or interbedded shale and very fine grained sandstone. It is noncalcareous except for thin strata in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sabatka soils are on uplands, ridges and hills.  The soils formed in residuum or alluvium over residuum derived from nonacid shale.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 3,500 to 5,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 17 inches, half of which falls as rain and snow from late March through June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."

Gateson soils are fine-loamy and have argillic horizons.  Lismas, Samsil and Mittenbutte soils are shallow.  Mittenbutte soils have less than 18 percent clay throughout.  Xema soils are coarse-loamy and have argillic horizons."
