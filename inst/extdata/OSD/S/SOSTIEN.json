    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline throughout.  Cracks 1 to 3 centimeters wide develop to a depth of 50 to 60 centimeters in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is clay, silty clay, or silty clay\nloam.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles, where present, are in shades of brown.  Some pedons have thin lenses or clods with hue of 5YR, value 4 or\n5, and chroma 4 or 6.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  Few to\ncommon pockets, streaks, or strata of sandy or loamy materials\noccur throughout.  Accumulations of calcium carbonate range from\nnone to common."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sostien soils are on spoil banks adjacent to rivers and canals.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The soils\nare forming in thick, clayey sediments dredged from canals or\nrivers or from land surfaces during construction of waterways. The climate is warm and humid.  The mean annual temperature is about\n66 degrees F., and the mean annual rainfall is about 59 inches\nnear the type location."

Bruin, Commerce, Convent, and Crevasse soils are on\nnearby undisturbed areas and are loamy throughout.  Cocodrie soils are developing in dredged materials and are coarse-silty."
