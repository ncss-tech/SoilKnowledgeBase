  "OVERVIEW": "The Sheckle series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in alluvium and residuum derived dominantly from sandstone and shale. These soils are on mountain plateaus and have slopes of 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 19 inches.",

Texture is loam or sandy loam in the upper part and sandy clay loam or loam in the lower part.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 4 to 6.

Arnegard, Falkirk and Roseglen soils have cambic horizons and have horizons of carbonate accumulation.  Beman soils are more alkaline that neutral in all horizons. Bowery soils have a cambic horizon.  Garza soils are uniformly calcareous within a depth of 0 to 10 inches.  Garlips soils are slightly to moderately alkaline throughout.  Lonecone soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to soft partially weathered sandstone bedrock.  Obrien soils are formed in glacial till and have an accumulation of carbonates from 21 to 60 inches.  Shawa soils are dominantly clay loam and have less than 45 percent sand in the particle size control section."
