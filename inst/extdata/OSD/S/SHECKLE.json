Arnegard, Falkirk and Roseglen soils have cambic horizons and have horizons of carbonate accumulation.  Beman soils are more alkaline that neutral in all horizons. Bowery soils have a cambic horizon.  Garza soils are uniformly calcareous within a depth of 0 to 10 inches.  Garlips soils are slightly to moderately alkaline throughout.  Lonecone soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to soft partially weathered sandstone bedrock.  Obrien soils are formed in glacial till and have an accumulation of carbonates from 21 to 60 inches.  Shawa soils are dominantly clay loam and have less than 45 percent sand in the particle size control section."

These soils formed in alluvium and residuum derived dominantly from sandstone and shale. The mean annual air temperature is 39 to 44 degrees F. Average annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches. The freeze free period is 80 to 100 days."

Faim and Losee soils are in a cryic temperature regime and occur either at higher elevations or on north aspects of moderately steep to very steep mountainsides. Fughes soils have a fine textured argillic horizon and occur downslope of the Sheckle soils on gently sloping mountain terraces."
