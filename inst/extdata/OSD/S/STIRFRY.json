  "OVERVIEW": "The Stirfry series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils in drainageways of a lava plateau.  These soils formed in mossy organic material over volcanic ash and pumice.  Stirfry soils have moderately rapid permeability.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
