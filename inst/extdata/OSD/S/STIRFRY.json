They have layers of limnic soil material, diatomaceous earth with n Values greater than 0.7 and lack histic epipedons.  Mesquito soils are in nearby flood plains.  They have layers with greater than 60 percent basalt cobbles, stones or boulders beginning at a depth of 10 to 20 inches.  Mariel soils are dominated by hemic organic soil material."

The potential natural plant community is the lodgepole pine/bog blueberry/widefruit sedge plant association (CLM3-12).  The hummocks or micro-highs, have a folistic epipedon, are considered part of the potential natural plant community.  The bog blueberry/fewflower spikerush plant association (SW41-12) is a seral community.  This seral community is supported in positions where hummocks or micro-highs are widely dispersed or absent."
