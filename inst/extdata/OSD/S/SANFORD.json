  "OVERVIEW": "The Sanford series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from gneiss and schist or similar bedrock.  Sanford soils are on mountain sides and have slopes of 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.",
