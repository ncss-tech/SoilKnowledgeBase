  "OVERVIEW": "The Splittop series consists of moderately deep well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits reworked by water and residuum from basalt. Splittop soils are on basalt plains and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent. Permeability is moderate. The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
