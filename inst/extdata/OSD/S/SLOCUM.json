  "OVERVIEW": "The Slocum series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium.  These soils are on low stream terraces and floodplains.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
