    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The soils are on undulating to rolling dissected loess hills and plains. Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent but are mostly between 3 and 15 percent. Elevation is 2,200 to 3,750 feet (675 to 1144 meters). The soils formed in deep loess with minor influence of volcanic ash in the upper part. The subhumid climate has a mean annual precipitation of 584 to 940 mm and a mean annual temperature of 5 to 8 degrees C. The frost-free period is 60 to 130 days."
