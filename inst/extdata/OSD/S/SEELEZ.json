Depth to calcareous material ranges from 10 to 30 inches.  Surface horizons with value of 5 dry and 3 moist and chroma of 3 are less than 7 inches thick.  The soil is mildly to moderately alkaline throughout.  The soil moisture regime borders on aridic.  The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4, dry and moist.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or heavy loamy fine sand.  The AC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and chroma of 3 or 4 moist.  The C horizon is mainly fine sandy loam or sandy loam and ranges to loamy sand in the lower part.  It ranges from moderately to strongly calcareous."
