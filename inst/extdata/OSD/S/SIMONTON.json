The soils formed in alluvium and colluvium weathered from granite, andesite, rhyolite and minor amounts of basalt.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 20 inches.  The average January temperature is 15 degrees F., the average July temperature is 66 degrees F., and the average annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 60 to 100 days."
