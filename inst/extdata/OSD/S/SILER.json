The umbric epipedon is l0 to 16 inches thick.  Rock fragments in the particle-size control section are 0 to 5 percent. Siler soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and l2 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days within the three months following the summer solstice.  The soil is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  Ir is silt loam or fine sandy loam.  This horizon has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure. The 2C horizon has value of 5 through 7 moist, 7 or 8 dry, and chroma of l through 3 moist or dry.  It is sand or coarse sand.\nThe 2AB horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  There are thin (l to 4 inch) layers of loamy sand in some pedons."

Mean January temperature is 35 degrees F,; mean July temperature is 64 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 50 degrees  F.; and mean frost-free season is l25 to l75 days."
