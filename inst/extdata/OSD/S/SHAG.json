The moderately well drained Croswell soils formed in sandy deposits and occur on higher landscape positions.  The poorly drained Evart soils formed in sandy alluvium and occur on lower landscape positions.  The moderately well drained Fence and the somewhat poorly drained Spear (proposed) soils are in the same drainage sequence."
