  "OVERVIEW": "The Selman series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in alluvium of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on terrace treads or shoulders and summits of dissected terraces on uplands of the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78C).  Slope is mainly less than 3 percent but ranges from 0 to 8 percent.",
