  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 30 inches thick; the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches thick. Organic carbon in the mollic epipedon ranges from 1 to 3 percent and decreases uniformly with increasing depth. The soils are 80 to 100 percent base saturated. Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent and are mostly stones more than 10 inches in diameter. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 degrees to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 40 degrees to 59 degrees F. The A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It typically has granular structure but has subangular blocky structure in some pedons. This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.  The B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It usually has subangular blocky structure but has weak prismatic structure in some pedons. This horizon is sandy loam, and has 8 to 18 percent clay 5 to 40 percent silt and 50 to 80 percent sand, with more than 35 percent fine or coarser. It generally has 5 to 10 percent more clay than the overlying or underlying horizons and has oriented clay films in some part. It is neutral or mildly alkaline. The C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR. It is neutral or mildly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Sublette soils are on gently to moderately sloping uplands. Slopes range from 1 to about 12 percent. They formed in moderately coarse textured noncalcareous glacial till deposits or in alluvial fan sediments of similar texture. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 15 inches, with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer. The mean annual temperature is 34 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 57 degrees F."
