  "OVERVIEW": "The Sibleyville series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from sandstone and silty and sandy shale. These soils are on uplands. The mean annual precipitation is about 84 centimeters, and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
