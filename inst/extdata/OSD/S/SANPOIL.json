    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F. These soils are saturated in the moisture control section from winter through late spring. The particle-size control section is 5 to 18 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent rock fragments by weighted average. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist. It is silt loam or loam in the lower part. It is 0 to 15 percent pebbles.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist. It is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam and may be gravelly. It is commonly stratified. Pebble content ranges from 0 to 20 percent.\nThe Ab horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist. It is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam and may be gravelly. Pebble content ranges from 0 to 20 percent. Some pedons lack an Ab horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has the same colors as the C horizon or is multicolored. Textures range from sandy loam to very gravelly sand and stratification is common. It is 0 to 50 percent pebbles and 0 to 10 percent cobbles. The 2C horizon is below 60 inches in some pedons."

Conway soils usually dry between a depth of 10 and 33 inches from about August 15 to November 15 and average 15 to 30 percent have rock fragments mainly pebbles in the particle-size control section. Schrader soils lack a buried A horizon and are up to 15 percent exchangeable sodium in the particle-size control section."

Elevations range from 1,600 to 3,800 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters. The average annual precipitation is 15 to 20 inches. The mean January temperature is about 22 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
