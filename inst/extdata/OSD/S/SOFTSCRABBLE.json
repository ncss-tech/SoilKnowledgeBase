  "OVERVIEW": "The Softscrabble series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived mainly from volcanic rocks.  Softscrabble soils are on plateaus, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
