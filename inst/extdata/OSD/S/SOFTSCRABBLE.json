Camelback soils have rock fragments which are mainly quartzite and are dominated by cobbles in the particle-size control section.  Chrisflat soils average 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section and do not have paralithic contacts within 200 cm of the soil surface.  Dogbed soils average 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Erig soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Krenka soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Leroman and Staberg soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Softscrabble soils are on plateaus, hills, and mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks with some areas of chert, quartzite, and shale.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,465 to 2,505 meters. The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 500 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
