  "OVERVIEW": "The Sandbranch series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Sandbranch soils are on alluvial fans, fan aprons, and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the natric horizon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to any contrasting substrata is greater than 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 39 to 64 degrees F.  Coarse fragments are typically less than 5 percent throughout but are allowed to range up to 15 percent in the upper 40 inches of the solum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  EC ranges from 0 to 4 mmhos.  Reaction is moderately through very strongly alkaline.  A thin E horizon is present in some pedons between the A and Btn horizons.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 5.  Texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam, or loam with 18 to 35 percent clay.  Secondary accumulation of carbonates, gypsum, and salts more soluble than gypsum are present in the lower part of many natric horizons.  EC ranges from 4 to 16 mmhos.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 15 to 30 percent.  Reaction, unless buffered by gypsum, ranges from strongly alkaline through very strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with 15 to 30 percent clay.  Secondary accumulation of sodium, gypsum, and salts more soluble than gypsum are also common in this horizon in many pedons; thus, y, z, and n are common additional subordinate suffixes.  EC ranges from 2 to 16 mmhos.  Exchangeable sodium ranges to 30 percent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline through very strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam with 15 to 30 percent clay.  EC is 2 to 16 mmhos and exchangeable sodium ranges from 5 to 20 percent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline through very strongly alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sandbranch soils are on alluvial fans, fan aprons, terraces, and at the margins of basins.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from sodic sandstone and interbedded sandy shale.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Elevation is 6,000 to 7,400 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 9 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to be 80 to 110 days depending upon aspect, elevation, and air drainage."

Horsley soils are shallow to bedrock and have no diagnostic subhorizons.  Kandaly soils are sandy.  Monte soils have less than 15 percent exchangeable sodium and have no diagnostic subhorizons.  Ryan Park soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section, more organic carbon in the upper 15 inches, and less than 15 percent exchangeable sodium.  Youjay soils are shallow and have over 35 percent clay throughout."
