    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained: slow runoff; slow permeability, some areas have rapid permeability in the substratum.  A water table is at a depth of 61 to 91 cm from March 1 to June 1.  Shondow soils have been artificially drained by groundwater pumping and water diversions.  The soils watertable now fluctuates according to demand for pumping.  During years of above average precipitation the watertable rises us the demand for pumping decreases and conversely during dry years the watertable lowers and the demand increases.  Drained phases of Shondow soils are recognized and are moderately well drained with a water table at 152 to 183 cm."
