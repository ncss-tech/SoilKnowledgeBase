  "OVERVIEW": "The Skidoosprings series consists of deep to a duripan, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks.  Skidoosprings soils are on high lake terraces occurring as remnant mounds in stream dissected areas.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
