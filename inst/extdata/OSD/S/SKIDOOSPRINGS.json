    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Skidoosprings soils are on high lake terraces occurring as remnant mounds in stream dissected areas.  They formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Elevations range from 4,000 to 4,500 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
