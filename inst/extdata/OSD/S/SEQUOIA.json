  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum and depth to rippable bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid except where lime has been added.  Coarse fragments of shale range from 0 to 10 percent in the A horizon and from 0 to 25 percent in the B and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Horizons with value of 3 are less than 6 inches thick.  Severely eroded pedons have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is silt loam or rarely loam.  Severely eroded areas are silty clay loam, silty clay, or rarely clay loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8, and the lower part has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons are mottled with shades of brown, yellow, or red.  Texture of the fine earth is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam.\nThe BC horizon or C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Some pedons are an evenly mottled pattern in shades of brown, yellow, red, and gray.  Texture of the fine earth is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam.\nThe Cr horizon is soft shale with thin seams of silt loam or silty clay loam between rock strata."

All of these series except Trappist are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock.  Trappist soils formed in colluvium or residuum from black fissile shale and siltstone.  The Bt horizon in Trappist has dominant hue of 7.5YR or 10YR.\nThe Enders series is in a similar family.  Enders soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock and are thermic."
