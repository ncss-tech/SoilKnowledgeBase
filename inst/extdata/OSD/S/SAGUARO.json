  "OVERVIEW": "The Saguaro series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils formed in alluvium and colluvium weathered from limestone and marble.  These soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 15 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 67 degrees F.",
