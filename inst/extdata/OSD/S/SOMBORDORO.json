Some pedons have an A2 horizon 1 to 3 inches thick with value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 2 through 4.  This horizon is very stony very fine sandy loam to very cobbly loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 4 through 6.  It is extremely stony or very stony clay or sandy clay.   It contains 35 to 80 percent rock fragments by volume.  Carbonates are present immediately above the lithic contact in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sombordoro soils are on uplands and have slopes of 0 to 45 percent.  They formed in material weathered from sedimentary rocks, mainly sandstone. Elevations are 5,500 to 7,000 feet.  The soils occur in a semiarid continental climate and receive about 75 percent of their moisture as summer showers between May and September. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 47 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 135 to 160 days."
