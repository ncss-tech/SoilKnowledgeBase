  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Soda Lake soils are on alluvial fans and barrier beaches adjacent to volcanic cones.  They formed in volcanic ash, basaltic lapilli, and in alluvium derived mainly from basalt along with some granitic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,219 to 1,280 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 130 to 145 days."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat excessively drained with some areas altered to somewhat poorly drained; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  The altered drainage is due to excessive seepage from irrigation canals that traverse the area and irrigation water losses.  In these areas the water table fluctuates from a high of 3 feet during the peak of the irrigation season to about 10 feet during the winter months when the canals are dry.  In other areas the water table is below 10 feet."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Soda Lake soils are used for livestock grazing and irrigated cropland.  The vegetation is mainly shadscale, fourwing saltbush, Bailey's greasewood, and bud sagebrush in the better drained areas and black greasewood in the more poorly drained areas.  Alfalfa, corn, pasture, small grains, and melons are the principal crops."
