  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Silver series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous materials derived from basalt and sedimentary rocks.  Silver soils are on convex positions of hills, fan terraces, piedmonts, mesas and plateaus.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Silver soils are on convex positions of piedmont slopes, hills, fan terraces, mesas and plateaus.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed in calcareous material from sources of basalt, and sedimentary rock with some addition of eolian material.  This unconsolidated material is more than 5 feet thick.  The climate is semiarid continental.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 49 to 55 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches, with a marked summer maximum characterized by heavy thunderstorms of short duration.  In a few areas the precipitation is higher. The frost-free season ranges from 120 to 170 days and elevation of ranges from 4,700 to 7,500 feet."
