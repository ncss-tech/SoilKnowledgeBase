  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Silver soils are on convex positions of piedmont slopes, hills, fan terraces, mesas and plateaus.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed in calcareous material from sources of basalt, and sedimentary rock with some addition of eolian material.  This unconsolidated material is more than 5 feet thick.  The climate is semiarid continental.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 49 to 55 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches, with a marked summer maximum characterized by heavy thunderstorms of short duration.  In a few areas the precipitation is higher. The frost-free season ranges from 120 to 170 days and elevation of ranges from 4,700 to 7,500 feet."
