    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Surface textures include silt loam and silty clay loam. There are, however, small inclusions of light silty clay in the silty clay loam type. Textures of the Bw and Bk horizons include both silt loam and silty clay loam but the former is near the silty clay loam boundary. The depth to the Bk ranges from 10 to 15 inches and the Bw may be slightly calcareous in its lower part. Deep plowing in naturally thin sola or wind eroded spots may reach into the upper part of the Bk and result in light colored limy spots in some fields. Some areas have moderate, beneficially subirrigation."
