  "OVERVIEW": "The Steff series consists of deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils, formed in mixed acid alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 46 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 50 inches.  Thickness of the alluvial deposit ranges from about 60 to 200 inches.  Soil reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid except where limed.  The content of sandstone or siltstone pebbles ranges from 0 to about 5 percent to a depth of about 40 inches, and up to 50 percent below 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons have thin A1 horizons with value of 3.  It is dominantly silt loam, but is loam in some pedons.\nThe Bw1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Mottles are in shades of gray or brown.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The Bw2 horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Mottles are in shades of gray and brown.  In some pedons the gray and brown colors in the Bw2 horizon are about evenly divided.\nThe C horizon matrix and mottles has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma 2 to 6.  It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Below 50 inches stratified layers of sandy loam and gravelly modifiers of the C horizon textures are in some pedons."
