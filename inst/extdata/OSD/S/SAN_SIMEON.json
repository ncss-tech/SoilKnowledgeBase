  "OVERVIEW": "The San Simeon series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils that formed on soft sandstone.  San Simeon soils are on hills within 2 miles of the Pacific Ocean.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact of soft sandstone is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 61 degrees F.  The soil between depths of 10 to 29 inches is usually dry all of the time from mid-July until November and is moist in some part the rest of the year.\nThe A1 horizon is gray, grayish brown or brown (10YR 5/1, 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 5/2) dry, and very dark grayish brown or dark brown (10YR 3/2, 3/3; 7.5YR 3/2) moist.  It is sandy loam or loam and has 10 to 20 percent clay and is medium or slightly acid\nThe A2 horizon is light gray, gray, light yellowish brown or light brownish gray (10YR 7/1, 6/1, 6/2, 6/4) or grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) with few or common, fine and distinct mottles of pale brown, light yellowish brown or brown (10YR 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 5/4).  It is sandy loam or loam and has 5 to 15 percent clay.  Reaction is medium acid to very strongly acid.\nTypically, the B2t horizon appears marbled with polychromatic colors of brown or strong brown (7.5YR 5/4, 5/6), dark grayish brown, grayish brown and yellowish brown (10YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/4), or light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/2) with spots, streaks, patches and films of dark red or red (2.5YR 3/6, 4/6), reddish brown (5YR 4/4), brown or strong brown (7.5YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/4, 5/6), yellowish brown or dark grayish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/8, 4/2).  It is clay with 45 to 60 percent clay.  It is very strongly acid to medium acid.  Base saturation is 55 to 85 percent.  Some pedons have a few non-intersecting slickensides.\nThe Cr layer of soft sandstone is polychromatic and often appears marbled with streaks, spots and films in hues ranging from 7.5YR to 5Y.  This material crushes to textures ranging from sandy loam to sandy clay, depending upon the amount of clay films in cracks.  Reaction is very strongly acid to medium acid."
