The soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from limestone, but some sandstone and quartzite.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The soils are in a semiarid climate.  Mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C.  Average annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm.  The freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days."
