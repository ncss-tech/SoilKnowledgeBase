  "OVERVIEW": "The Spager series consists of shallow over a calcium carbonate cemented hardpan, somewhat excessively drained, that formed in alluvium derived mainly from limestone.  Spager soils are on alluvial plains, fan remnants and hillslopes. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
