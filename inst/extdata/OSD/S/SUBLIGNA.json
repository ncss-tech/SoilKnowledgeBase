Soils in related families are the Avant, Beanblossom, Bigfork, Cliffside, Cobstone, Craigsville, Lillington, Lockhart, Saffell, Steprock, Trestle, and Zaffra series.  Avant, Bigfork, Cliffside, Cobstone, Lillington, Lockhart, Saffell, Steprock, and Zaffra soils have argillic horizons.  Beanblossom, Craigsville, and Trestle soils are in a mesic temperature regime."

The soils formed in alluvium high in sandstone and chert rock fragments. Average annual temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F, and average annual precipitation is about 45 to 55 inches."

All of these soils have argillic horizons.  With the exception of Bigfork and Bodine soils, all have less than 35 percent rock fragments throughout.  Bigfork, Bodine, Fullerton, and Shack soils formed in residuum on adjacent uplands.  Minvale and Nella soils formed in colluvium on adjacent footslopes, benches, and fans.  Wax soils are moderately well drained and formed in alluvium on adjacent toe slopes and drainageways."

The 6/01 revision reflects the reclassification of the series and the movement of the typical pedon to Whitfield County, Georgia.\nDiagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to approximately 6 inches (Oa and A horizon).\nCambic horizon - the zone from approximately 6 to 18 inches (Bw horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
