  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to soft bedrock and paralithic contact ranges from 4 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F.  The soils commonly are calcareous throughout, but some pedons are leached to 6 inches.  The particle size control section averages 20 to 35 percent clay and has more than 15 percent but less than 35 percent fine or coarser  sand.  The soil is usually dry. The moisture control section is usually moist in April, May and early June. It is dry for 60 consecutive days or more during the 90 day period following the summer solstice.  EC is 0 to 2 mmhos throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  Reaction is neutral through strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have a light gravel lag on the surface. Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, cobbly loam, and gravelly clay loam. Rock fragments or shale channers range from 0 to 35 percent.\nA Bw or AC horizon, when present, has the combined properties of the A and C horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  Rock fragments or shale channers range from 0 to 35 percent. Reaction is slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline."

Canyon soils are somewhat excessively drained.  Dulce, Tassel, and Taluce soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section. Epping soils have siltstone chips in the control section and contain a significant amount of glass shards.  Eslendo, Quarteles and Sandoval soils are dry in May and June.  Gerst and Picante soils are not dry for 60 consecutive days during the three months following the summer solstice.  Redarrow and Remorris soils have hue of 5YR or redder."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Shingle soils occur on all hillslope positions.  Slopes are 0 to 80 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from soft, interbedded sandstone and shale or in alluvium from mudstone. Elevation is 3,200 to 6,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 to 14 inches, most of which falls in April, May, and June.  The mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.but ranges from 43 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."
