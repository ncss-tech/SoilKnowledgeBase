    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 62 to 64 degrees F.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The soil is noncalcareous to a depth of 5 to 20 inches.  The particle- size control section averages 50 to 60 percent clay, 30 to 45 percent silt, and 5 to 15 percent sand.  When the soil dries, cracks develop to a depth of 20 to 30 inches are 0.5 to 0.75 inch wide, and remain open for 90 to 150 days cumulative.  Slickensides commonly intersect.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has variegated hues of 2.5Y, 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR, 2.5YR, and 10R and with hues 7.5YR or redder dominating.  Values are 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma is 3 or 4."
