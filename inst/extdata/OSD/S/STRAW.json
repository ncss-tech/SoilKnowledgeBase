  "OVERVIEW": "The Straw series consists of very deep, moderately well and well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on floodplains, stream terraces and drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
