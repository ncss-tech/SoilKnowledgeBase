The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F. under a tree canopy. These soils are usually moist, but have a short dry period of less than 45 days following the summer solstice. Depth to bedrock is over 60 inches. Thickness of the andic soil property materials and depth to the 2B horizon is 19 to 40 inches.  The andic soil material has a phosphate retention of 95 to 100 percent, Alox +  Feox of 3.0 to 5.0 percent, moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.85 g/cc, and 15-bar moisture of 20 to 35 percent. The particle-size control section average less than 35 percent rounded rock fragments and 10 to 35 percent clay by field estimate. The umbric epipedon ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  Reaction is very strongly or strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It has 10 to 25 percent clay, 0 to 5 percent rounded gravel, and 10 to 15 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry. Texture is medial loam or medial silt loam  It has 10 to 27 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent rounded gravel.\nThe 2Bw or 3BC horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 7 dry and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  It has 10 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent rounded gravel.\nThe 2C, 3C, or 4C horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 6 moist and dry, and chroma of 2 through 6 moist and dry, and is variegated in some pedons.  Texture is loamy sand, sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  It has 5 to 15 percent clay, 0 to 75 percent rounded gravel, and 0 to 10 percent rounded cobbles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Siletz soils are on stream terraces at elevations of 50 to 400 feet. Slopes are 0 to 7 percent. They formed in silty over loamy alluvium of predominantly igneous origin. The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 100 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 49 to 52 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is about 40 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F. The frost-free period is 160 to 260 days."

Quillamook soils have a medial particle-size family class, have a melanic epipedon, and and are on a slightly higher terrace. Wolfer soils have a medial over sandy or sandy-skeletal particle-size family class and are on a higher terrace."
