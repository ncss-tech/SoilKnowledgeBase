Thickness of the andic soil property materials and depth to the 2B horizon is 19 to 40 inches.  The andic soil material has a phosphate retention of 95 to 100 percent, Alox +  Feox of 3.0 to 5.0 percent, moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.85 g/cc, and 15-bar moisture of 20 to 35 percent. The particle-size control section average less than 35 percent rounded rock fragments and 10 to 35 percent clay by field estimate. The umbric epipedon ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  Reaction is very strongly or strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.
