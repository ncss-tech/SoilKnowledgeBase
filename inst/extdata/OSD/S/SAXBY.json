  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Kinghorn, Murphill, Samor and Soma series.\nKinghorn soils have dominant hue of 5YR and are underlain by conglomerate. Murphill soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are formed in residuum from vitric tuffs, with lime and silica cementing the crack fractures. Samor soils have a thin lime pan above the bedrock and lack Bw horizons.  Soma soils lack a cambic horizon and are underlain by sandstone, limestone, or quartzite."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Saxby soils are on lake terraces, foothills, hillslopes and mountainsides at elevations of 1,295 to 2,044 meters. The soils formed in colluvium, residuum and alluvium derived from basalt overwashed with lacustrine sediments. Some areas are influenced by loess. Slopes are dominantly 10 to 30 percent but range from 1 to 60 percent. The climate is semiarid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, average annual air temperature is 7 to 10.5 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 140 days."

Bram, Etil, and Palisade soils lack coarse fragments in the textural control section. Sanpete soils formed in alluvium from limestone and have a carbonatic mineralogy. Bram soils are on low terraces and alluvial fans. Etil soils are on low areas near salt playas and beach areas of the Great Salt Lake. Palisade and Sanpete soils are on alluvial fans."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 25 cm (A horizon).\nCambic horizon - The zone from 10 to 30 cm (Bw horizon).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 30 to 45 cm (Bk horizon).\nLithic contact - The zone at approximately 45 cm (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 18 cm (part of the Bw horizon and the Bk horizon).\nThe series concept needs to be redefined. There appears to be a difference in the use of the soil in the ID708-UT601-UT602 areas and the use of the soil in UT608, UT634 and UT626. Clay contents in the control section are lower in the northern surveys than in the southern areas.\nThis soil was reclassified from Lithic Xerollic Calciorthids to Lithic Xeric Haplocalcids on 9/94.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
