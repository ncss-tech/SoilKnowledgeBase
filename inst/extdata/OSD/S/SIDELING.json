Soils in similar or closely related families are the Birdsboro, Chilmark, Hassler, Roselle, Thurmont, and Tulip series. The Brumbaugh and Thurmont soils formed in colluvium from metamorphic rocks and have a lithologic discontinuity from 30 to 60 inches.   Chilmark soils formed in a loamy or sandy aeolian mantle over coastal plain sediments on the islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard in MLRA 149B. Hassler soils are deep to granite bedrock and formed in colluvium and residuum on mountain ridges in the Ozark Highland area (MLRA 116A). Roselle soils formed in colluvium and residuum from granite on terraces and footslopes in mountain basins in the Ozark Highland area (MLRA 116A).  Tulip soils formed in colluvium from sandstone and siltstone and in residuum from underlying shale in south central Indiana (MLRA 120). The Birdsboro soils formed in old alluvial deposits from shale, sandstone, or siltstone."
