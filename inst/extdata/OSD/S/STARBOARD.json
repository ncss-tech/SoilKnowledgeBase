The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about mid-September to mid-November (about 60 days) and is usually moist the rest of the time.\nSurface texture varies from gravelly to non-gravelly. This texture modifier includes dead wood debris and cobbles, which vary in ground accumulation.\nDepth to bedrock is 20 to 43 inches (50 to 107 centimeters), but best represented by 20 to 40 inches (50 to 100 cm).\nThe particle size control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 30 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon dry color is 10YR and 7.5YR 5/2, 5/3, 4/2, 4/3, 3/3, or 3/2.

Adieux soils are found on mound positions located on plateaus andhave slopes of 0 to 5 percent. Banning soils are very deep and somewhat poorly drained. Coolbirth soils have a plowed A horizon, are cultivated for hay and are saturated during the spring. Deadpan soils have mean annual temperatures of 45 to 55 degrees F. and are deep on mountains. Dotta, Drews, Gorman, Harriman, Henhill, Piercepark, Pumphouse, Wapinitia, and Yaxon soils are dry for more than 60 consecutive days. Dotta and Drews soils are very deep and are formed on alluvial fans and terraces. Gorman soils are very deep and formed from mostly granitic rock sources. Harriman, Henhill, and Piercepark and Vanu Dusen soils are very deep and formed in lacustrine deposits. Lonkey soils formed in alluvium and are found under grass and small shrubs. Robinette soils has are deep and are influenced by loess in the surface a frost free period of only 100 to 120 days. Waha soils contain loess parent material and the frost-free period is 100 to 160 days. Blockhouse soils are very deep, formed in swales from alluvium on slopes less than 5 percent. Pumphouse and Wapinita soils are deep and are formed in loess. Yaxon soils are very deep formed from sandstone or schist mixed with loess. Haysum, Rankor, Supan soils have greater than 35 percent clay in the upper part of the argillic. Haysum soils are very deep and found on stream terraces and alluvial fans. Rankor soils are deep and formed from schist and granitic rock. Supan soils have redder hues of 5YR and have 30 to 45 inches of rain."
