Conotton soils average less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Dorerton soils has sandy-skeletal material from fragmented dolostone or limestone in the lower part of the series control section and dolostone or limestone bedrock underlies this material at depths of 114 to 190 cm (45 to 70 inches) or more. Hawksbill and Lutzke soils are less than 102 cm (40 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Leoni soil average more than 15 percent gravel in the surface horizons. Oakhill soils have a paralithic and lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Silverwood soils are on stream terraces, kames, eskers, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. The soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of silty material and in the underlying loamy and gravelly outwash. They are deep to calcareous, stratified sandy and gravelly outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1067 mm (36 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 54 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 150 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 152 to 213 meters (500 to 700 feet) above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Adeland and Mitiwanga soils are on footslopes of structural benches. The well drained Battleground, Genesee, and Stonelick soils are on adjacent flood plains. The well drained Cates, Judyville, and Loudonville soils are moderately deep to bedrock. The well drained Ockley soils are on higher adjacent stream terraces and are deeper to very gravelly outwash. The moderately well drained Miami and Rainsville soils and the well drained Russell soils are on nearby moraines and are formed in till."
