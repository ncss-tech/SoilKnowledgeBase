  "OVERVIEW": "The Silverwood series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are deep to calcareous, stratified sandy and gravelly outwash. The soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of silty material and in the underlying loamy and gravelly outwash. They are on stream terraces, kames, eskers, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",

The well drained Cates, Judyville, and Loudonville soils are moderately deep to bedrock. The well drained Ockley soils are on higher adjacent stream terraces and are deeper to very gravelly outwash. The moderately well drained Miami and Rainsville soils and the well drained Russell soils are on nearby moraines and are formed in till."
