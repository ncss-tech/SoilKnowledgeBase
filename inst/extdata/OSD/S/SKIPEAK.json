  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 42 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist, but are dry in the soil moisture control section for 30 to 45 days during summer and fall.  The upper 14 to 30 inches of the soil has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of more than 2.0 percent and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  The upper portion of the particle-size control section averages 35 to 40 percent rock fragments by volume.  The lower portion of the particle-size control section contains 50 to 60 percent rock fragments.  Depth to the lithologic discontinuity is 14 to 30 inches.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 0 through 2 moist or dry.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bs horizons have value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry.  Textures are gravelly ashy sandy loam, very gravelly ashy sandy loam or very gravelly ashy loam.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 40 percent by volume.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2CB and 2C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist or dry. Textures are very gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly sand. Rock fragments range from 45 to 60 percent by volume.  Structure is weak fine subangular blocky to single grain.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Skipeak soils are on terraces at elevations of 1,800 to 2,500 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in volcanic ash overlying glacial outwash sands and gravels. They are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters. The average annual precipitation is 70 to 100 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 22 degrees F, the July temperature is about 59 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F. The growing season at 28 degrees F is about 100 to 130 days."
