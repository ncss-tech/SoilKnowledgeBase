  "OVERVIEW": "The Sanpitch series consists of very deep, well drained soils that were formed in alluvium from mixed igneous, limestone, and shale rocks.  These soils are on moderately steep to very steep hillside slopes.  The mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 13 inches.",

It is neutral to moderately alkaline and is moderately to strongly calcareous.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry and 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It ranges from loam to clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay, more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand, and 15 to 35 percent gravel and cobbles.
