  "OVERVIEW": "The Sanpitch series consists of very deep, well drained soils that were formed in alluvium from mixed igneous, limestone, and shale rocks.  These soils are on moderately steep to very steep hillside slopes.  The mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 13 inches.",
