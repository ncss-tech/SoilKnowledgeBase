The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 63 degrees F. In more than 7 out of 10 years the soils are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 80 consecutive days after June 21, and are dry in the moisture control section about 55 percent of the time the soil temperature at 20 inches is above 41 degrees F. in most years, and are moist for 60 to 70 consecutive days during the 120 days after the winter solstice.\nThe Al horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is neutral to moderately alkaline and is moderately to strongly calcareous.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry and 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It ranges from loam to clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay, more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand, and 15 to 35 percent gravel and cobbles. This horizon is moderately to very strongly alkaline and contains 20 to 40 percent lime.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry and 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It ranges from loam to clay loam and contains 20 to 50 percent gravel and cobbles. It is moderately to strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING: Sanpitch soils are on moderately steep to very steep hillside slopes at elevations of 5,700 to 7,000 feet. They formed in alluvium from mixed igneous, limestone, and shale rocks. The climate is dry subhumid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 14 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 43 to 45 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
