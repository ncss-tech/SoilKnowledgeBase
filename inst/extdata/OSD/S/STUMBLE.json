Ecklund soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts. Hawsley soils are dominantly sand or fine sand. Isolde soils are dominantly fine sand or sand and have no rock fragments.  Kawich soils are calcareous throughout and are fine sand.  Razito soils have 0 to 5 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Sheppard soils have 5YR hue. Sundown soils are calcareous throughout.  Tipper soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts. Tipperary soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 12 degrees C. Tricera soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 10 degrees C. and are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days during summer months. Yenrab soils are calcareous throughout and have 20 to 50 percent exchangeable sodium."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stumble soils are on inset fans, fan skirts, pediments, alluvial flats, alluvial fans, sand sheets, and fan aprons. In New Mexico these soils also occur on fan remnants.  They formed in eolian sand and alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are mainly 0 to 15 percent in Nevada. In New Mexico slopes range up to 40 percent on backslopes of fan remnants. Elevations range from 1,092 to 1,839 meters in Nevada. In New Mexico, elevations range to 1,950 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 13 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 130 to 160 days. In New Mexico mean annual precipitation ranges from 200 to 250 mm, most of which comes from convective storms between July and September."

Jarboe soils are fine-loamy, have carbonatic mineralogy, and calcic horizons with carbonate concretions. Papoose soils are fine-loamy, very deep, and have argillic horizons. Tickapoo soils are clayey, shallow to duripans, and have argillic horizons. Timper soils are loamy and shallow to duripans."
