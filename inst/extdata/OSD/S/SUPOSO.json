  "OVERVIEW": "The Suposo series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  These soils are on stream terraces, valley sides and valley floors and have slopes of 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 432 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",
