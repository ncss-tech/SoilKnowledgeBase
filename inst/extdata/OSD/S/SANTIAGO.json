    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 12 to 36 inches. Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and to densic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Content of clay averages from 7 to 17 percent in the particle-size control section and the content of fine sand or coarser averages 15 to 70 percent. The base saturation (by sum of cations) is less than 60 percent in some part of the argillic horizon. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the silty mantle and from 5 to 35 percent in the till. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 3 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 5 percent in the till. Volume of stones ranges from 0 to 1 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 3 percent in the till. Surface stones have coverage ranging from 0 to 3 percent. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the solum, except it ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Dry value is greater than 5.5. Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon, 1 to 4 inches thick, with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silt loam.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. The E horizon is silt loam or silt.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4. It is silt loam. Bw horizons with spodic color have less than 0.6 percent organic carbon.\nSantiago soils have a glossic horizon. Horizonation has a wide range depending on the thickness of the silty mantle and the degree to which eluviation has occurred. Therefore, there can be E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons singly or in combination.\nThe E part of the E/B or B/E horizon has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.\nSome pedons have a Bt horizon with color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nThe 2E part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. The 2E part is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or their gravelly analogs, but in some pedons it is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand. The 2Bt part has color and texture like the 2Bt horizon described below.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 4 to 6. It is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or their gravelly analogs. The bulk density ranges from 1.65 to 1.90 gm/cc. Some pedons have pockets or strata of loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nThe 2BCd horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 4 to 6. It is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogs. Bulk density ranges from 1.8 to 2.0 gm/cc. Some pedons have pockets or strata of loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nThe 2Cd horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 4 to 6. It is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogs. Bulk density ranges from 1.8 to 2.0 gm/cc. Some pedons have pockets or strata of loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand."

In addition, Automba soils have base saturation of more than 60 percent in all parts of the argillic horizon.\nArland soils have a paralithic contact of sandstone at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.\nGoodland, Itasca, Kennan, Langlade, Marathon, Pemene, Rosholt, Scoba, and Steamboat soils do not have a densic contact within the series control section."
