  "OVERVIEW": "The Sutcliff series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, but mainly basalt.  These soils are on alluvial fans and fan piedmonts.  Slope is 4 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
