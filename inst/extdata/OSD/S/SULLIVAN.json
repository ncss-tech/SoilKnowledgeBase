  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is more than 5 feet.  Reaction is most commonly medium acid to neutral, but some pedons range to strongly acid.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in the upper 40 inches and from 0 to 50 percent below.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 and chroma of 2 to 4. Some pedons have an Ab horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.\nSome pedons have a thin A horizon with a value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A horizon is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon and Bwb horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Some pedons have a few mottles of 2 chroma or less below 24 inches.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Some pedons have few or common mottles of chroma 2 or less. The fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam and are commonly in alternating layers."

Chagrin, Hannahatchee, Ocana, Sensabaugh and Tuckahoe soils all have mixed mineralogy.  Chagrin and Sensabaugh soils are also mesic.  Hamblen soils have mottles of 2 chroma or less within 24 inches of the soil surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soil formed in loamy alluvium washed from soils formed from limestone, sandstone, and shale.  Near the type location, mean annual temperature is 58.7 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 42 inches."

The latter two are on the adjacent low terraces and have argillic horizons.  A large number of upland soils underlain by limestones, dolomites, and shales are associated with Sullivan soils."
