  "OVERVIEW": "The Sprabat series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from tuff.  Sprabat soils are on fan terraces. Permeability is moderately rapid.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
