The poorly drained Ruark soils are on the same or higher landforms but are in slight depressions and have a light colored surface layer. The poorly and very poorly drained Westland soils are in depressions on similar landforms and contain fewer rock fragments in the particle size control section. The very poorly drained, fine textured Darwin, the well drained Haymond, the poorly drained, fine textured Titus and the\nsomewhat poorly drained Wakeland soils are on floodplains."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Stockland soils are used to grow corn, soybeans, small grains, hay and various specialty crops, such as watermelons and cantaloupe. Most areas used for crops are irrigated. Some areas are used for pasture. Stockland soils are heavily quarried for their sand and gravel resources.  Native vegetation is prairie grasses."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: With the 12/2003 update the Stockland series was redescribed and reclassified according to Soil Taxonomy, 2nd edition dated 1999.\nWith the 4/2004 update the range in reaction BAt and Bt horizons and the rock fragment content in the BAt horizon have been expanded.  Laboratory data from the U of I and the NSSL were evaluated and used in revising the Range in Characteristics.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon- 0 to 24 inches; (Ap, A, and BAt horizons. Horizons below 24 inches fail to meet organic carbon requirement for mollic epipedons);   Cambic horizon- 14 to 60 inches; (BAt, Bt1, Bt2, and BCt horizons);\nUdic moisture regime;\nMesic temperature regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
