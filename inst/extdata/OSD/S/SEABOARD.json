  "OVERVIEW": "The Seaboard series consists of shallow, moderately well drained, rapidly permeability soils on broad, low uplands of the Lower Coastal Plain.  They formed in sandy marine or eolian sediments over fractured porous limestone bedrock.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to limestone ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid in the surface and moderately acid to neutral in the underlying horizon.  Many pedons have up to 5 percent, by volume, pebble to boulder-size limestone or chert fragments at the soil surface, or within the soil.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Masses of iron accumulation range in shades of brown or yellow range from none to common.  Most pedons have few to common, fine to coarse pockets of white or light gray sand grains, with chroma of 2.  The chroma of 2 is due to uncoated sand grains and does not indicate wetness.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 8, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is composed of soft, weathered, fractured limestone that can be dug with difficulty with a spade, has very firm to extremely firm rupture resistance with low to high excavation difficulty.  It usually contains soft carbonate accumulations along with few to many hard limestone or chert fragments.  It is highly irregular and interspersed with solution holes that range from 4 to 12 inches in diameter and filled with sandy loam to sandy clay textured soil material.  Depth to limestone is variable within short distances.\nThe 2R horizon is composed of hard, unweathered limestone that has slightly rigid to very rigid rupture resistance with very high to extremely excavation difficulty.  Some areas contain solution holes filled with Btg and/or Cr material."

The somewhat poorly drained Moriah soils have an argillic horizon and are deep to limestone bedrock.  Ortega, Otela, and Ridgewood soils are very deep.  In addition, Otela soils have argillic horizons and Ridgewood soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Shadeville soils are deep to limestone and have argillic horizons."
