    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 to 57 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is 66 to 72 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 50 inches thick. Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 10 to 40 inches. Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 13 to 50 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above depth of 60 inches and are mainly 1/4 to 3 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt and Btk horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 2 through 7, 2 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  This horizon is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  It ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR and dry value of 5 to 7, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam with 8 to 25 percent clay, 10 to 40 percent silt and 40 to 70 percent sand with up to 40 percent as fine sand and coarser.  This horizon ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline and has 3 to 14 percent calcium carbonate of the fine earth."

Albinas soils lack an arkosic influence below the argillic horizon and have frost-free periods of 120 to 140 days.  Garrett soils have hue of 5YR or redder, and have more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the argillic horizon.  Haxtun soils have polygenetic sola with sandy loam or light sandy clay loam upper argillic horizons that grade to less sandy texture with depth.  Jarita soils have fractured limestone at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Keya, Tracylee, and Woodly soils are noncalcareous throughout the profile.  Prosper and Renner soils are usually moist.  Woonsocket soils have more sand and less silt in the argillic horizons and are more moist.  Vosburg soils have dry moisture control sections for 15 consecutive days from May 15 to July 15 when soil temperatures at 20 inches is above 41 degrees F.  Wetterdon soils have more than 15% but less than 35% fine sand and coarser in the control section and C horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Sampson soils are on drainageways, stream terraces of alluvial fans where slope gradients range from 0 to 15 percent.  They formed in alluvium derived mostly from sedimentary or igneous rocks. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 13 to 17 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and summer.  The annual temperature is 47 to 55 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 66 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from 140 to 180 days.  Elevation at the type location is 6,105 feet."
