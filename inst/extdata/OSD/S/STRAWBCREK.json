    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Strawbcrek soils are on mountains. They typically occur on backslope positions. These soils formed in colluvium derived from granitic rocks. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 2,560 to 3,665 meters. The climate is moist-subhumid with cold wet winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 700 mm, mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days."
