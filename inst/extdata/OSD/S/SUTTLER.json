  "OVERVIEW": "The Suttler series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from gneiss, schist, granite and similar acidic rocks. Suttler soils are on mountainous areas and have slopes of 7 to 90 percent. Permeability is moderate. The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nThe mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010."
