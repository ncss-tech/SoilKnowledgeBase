  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the 2C horizon and carbonates is typically 40 to 55 inches but may be less than 40 inches in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 6 (3 through 5 moist) and chroma of 2 or 3.  Horizons having values of less than 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist are less than 10 inches thick.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe AC horizon is intermediate in color and texture between the A and C horizons.  It is lacking in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 (4 through 6 moist) and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 through 8 (5 through 7 moist) and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam with less than 18 percent clay.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Sand to loamy fine sand strata are in the lower part of the series control section in some places.  Some pedons have dark buried layers at depths below 40 inches.\nA calcareous phase of the Scoville series is recognized.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout the series control section.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 0 to 10 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Colfer and Dankworth series in the same family.  Curtis Siding(T), Dwyer, Mespun, Mido, Orpha, Pensom, Pinavetes, Reepo(T), Tullock, Valent and Wigton series may be reclassified to this family.  Colfer soils formed in eolian sand over lacustrine sediments and contain more fine and medium sand in the particle size control section.  Dankworth soils have 2 to 15 percent by volume of coarse fragments throughout the particle size control section.  Curtis Siding(T) soils have 15 to 35 percent gravel in the particle size control section.  Dwyer soils are calcareous above a depth of 30 inches.   Mespun and Mido soils have redder hues.  Orpha and Valent soils do not have loamy material in the lower part of the profile.  Penson, Reepo(T) and Tullock soils have a paralithic contact at depths below 20 inches.  Pinavettes soils formed in volcanic ash parent material and are usually dry in May and June.  Wigton soils formed in sand from arkose and weathered granitic rocks, have a higher proportion of medium and coarse angular sand, and have hard or very hard consistence in the C horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Scoville soils are on stream terraces.  They formed in wind worked sandy alluvium deposited over loamy alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 16 inches."
