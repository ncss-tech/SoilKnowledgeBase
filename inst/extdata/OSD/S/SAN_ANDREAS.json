  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 60 to 66 degrees F.  The soil temperature in the winter for most years is above 47 degrees F.  Soil between the depths of about 8 and 24 inches is usually dry all of the time from May until November or early December and usually is moist all the rest of the year.  The soils are sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam with less than 18 percent clay.  They are neutral to medium acid.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/1, 4/1, 5/2, 4/2, 5/3.  The organic matter content is 1 to 4 percent and decreases regularly to less than 1 percent between 10 and 20 inches below the surface.  This horizon usually has weak to moderate granular or subangular blocky structure but if the soil is massive, it is slightly hard or soft when dry.\nThe B horizon is 10YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2 ; 7.5YR  5/4, 6/2, 6/4.   Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam. It has few to common thin clay films as bridges, lining pores or as discontinuous films on faces of peds."

Pfeiffer soils are underlain by a paralithic contact at depths of more than 40 inches.  Tokay and Veritas are deep or very deep, moderately well drained soils.  Walong soils have more than 30 degrees F. difference between average summer and winter soil temperatures and are dry in all parts for more than 120 days."

The climate is subhumid with rainless but somewhat foggy summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation, all in the form of rain, is about 12 to 35 inches.  Average January temperature is about 50 degrees F, average July temperature is about 64 degrees F., mean annual temperature is 57 to 65 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is about 200 to 350 days."
