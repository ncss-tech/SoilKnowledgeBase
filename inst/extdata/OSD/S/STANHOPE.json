  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Melvin, Rahm, and Wayland series are in the same family. Melvin soils have a greater mean annual temperature. Rahm soils have a buried horizon within 20 to 36 inches. Wayland soils have carbonates in the series control section.\nSimilar series are the Aetna and Newark soils. Aetna soils have a buried mollic epipedon. Newark soils have mean annual temperatures ranging from 52 to 57 degrees F."

The somewhat excessively drained Chenango soils, moderately well drained Blakeslee soils, and somewhat poorly drained Red Hook soils are on adjacent outwash plains. The moderately well drained Otego soils occupy higher positions on the flood plain. The very poorly drained Wick soils occupy depressional areas on the flood plain."
