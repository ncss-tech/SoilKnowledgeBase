Reaction is slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline in the A horizon and moderately alkaline in the Bt, Bk, and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 2.5 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Content of pebbles ranges from 0 to 10 percent, by volume.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 2.5YR, value of 2.5 to 4, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Content of shell fragments range from few to many.  Content of pebbles ranges from 5 to 30 percent, by volume.  Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 8, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Many pedons do not have a dominant matrix color and are a mixture of these colors.  Tongues filled with Bt material from 2 cm to 15 cm in thickness ranges from few to many.  Content of shell fragments range from few to many.  Calcium carbonate masses, nodules, concretions, or filaments range from common to many.  Content of pebbles ranges from 10 to 30 percent, by volume.

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 2 to 11 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nCalcic horizon - the zone from 11 to 26 inches (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).\nLithic contact - at 31 inches (R horizon).\nSeboruco soils were formerly included in the Limestone Rockland miscellaneous land type.  The classification was updated with the 06/2002 draft from Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, isohyperthermic Calcidic Haplustalfs to Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, isohyperthermic Typic Calciargids.  A soil moisture study performed in the San German Area Soil Survey Update recognizes the Aridic Soil Moisture Regime in southern Puerto Rico.\nSeboruco soils are in MLRA 271.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
