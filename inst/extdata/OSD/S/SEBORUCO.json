  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "JLL; GRB",
  "REVDATE": "02/2008",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Seboruco series consist of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on side slopes and saddles of limestone hills and mountains in the semiarid mountains and valleys MLRA.  They formed in shallow marine sediments overlying limestone bedrock.  Near the type location, the mean annual air temperature is about 84 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches.  Slopes range from 12 to 90 percent.",

The classification was updated with the 06/2002 draft from Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, isohyperthermic Calcidic Haplustalfs to Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, isohyperthermic Typic Calciargids.  A soil moisture study performed in the San German Area Soil Survey Update recognizes the Aridic Soil Moisture Regime in southern Puerto Rico.\nSeboruco soils are in MLRA 271.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
