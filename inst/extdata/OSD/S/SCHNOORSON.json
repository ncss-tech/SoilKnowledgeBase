  "OVERVIEW": "The Schnoorson series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils in depressions and swales on flood plains.  They formed in alluvium.  Permeability is moderately slow in the upper part and slow below.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 25 inches and average annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
