  "OVERVIEW": "The Skyhaven series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to an indurated lime hardpan.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium dominantly from limestone, on basin floor remnants and relict alluvial flats.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches; mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F.",
