  "OVERVIEW": "The Staircase series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in alluvium from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent in mountain valleys, canyons and foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from granitic rocks. Average annual precipitation is dominantly 20 to 26 inches, but ranges to 16 inches in foothills.

Staircase soils are subject to rare flooding for brief or very brief periods in December through June. On some areas all or part of the pedon is commonly saturated during the growing season due to flood irrigation."

Native vegetation is very rare, but is considered to have been ponderosa pine and Lemon needlegrass in mountain valleys. Where mapped in foothills the native vegetation is basin big sagebrush and basin wildrye."

The dry phase under sagebrush (native rangeland) is less extensive."
