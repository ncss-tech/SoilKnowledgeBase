Boise soils do not have redox features within 60 inches (somewhat excessively drained) and are moist less than 90 consecutive days when the soil temperature is greater than 47 degrees F.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Staircase soils are nearly level or gently sloping on river and stream flood-plain steps and on drainageways on relict lake terraces at elevations of 3,000 to 4,500 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from granitic rocks. Average annual precipitation is dominantly 20 to 26 inches, but ranges to 16 inches in foothills. Average annual temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F. Frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained with a high water table at 40 to 60 inches below the surface at some time during April through June; very slow or slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability. Staircase soils are subject to rare flooding for brief or very brief periods in December through June. On some areas all or part of the pedon is commonly saturated during the growing season due to flood irrigation."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Staircase soils are used mainly for hayland/pasture (irrigated and non-irrigated). Some areas are used for rangeland or homesites. Native vegetation is very rare, but is considered to have been ponderosa pine and Lemon needlegrass in mountain valleys. Where mapped in foothills the native vegetation is basin big sagebrush and basin wildrye."
