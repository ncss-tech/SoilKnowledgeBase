  "OVERVIEW": "The Sidon series consists of deep moderately well drained soils\nthat formed in loamy residuum weathered from interbedded\nsiltstone, shale, and sandstone.  These soils are on sideslopes, undulating plateaus and benches and have slow permeability.\nSlopes range from 0 to 12 percent.",

Some pedons have\nthin Cr horizons.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 20 to 36\ninches.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid\nexcept where surface layers are limed.  Weathered sandstone\nfragments less than 3 inches in diameter in the A and Bt horizons range from 0 to 5 percent by volume.\nThe Ap or A1 horizon is 4 to 8 inches thick.  It has hue of 10YR, values of 4 and 5 and chromas of 3 or 4.  Textures are silt loam\nor loam.\nThe B21t horizon has hues of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 5 and chroma\nof 6 or 8.  In some pedons yellowish red (5YR 5/6, 5/8) coatings\nare on faces of peds.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, or loam.\nThe B22t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 and chroma\nof 6 or 8.  It has none to common mottles in shades of gray below depths of 16 inches.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, or\nloam.\nThe Bx horizon has matrix colors with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value\nof 5 and chroma of 6 or 8; and mottles in hue of 10YR, value 6 or\n7, and chroma 1 or 2; and hue of 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma\nof 6 or 8, or hue of 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6; or is mottled with shades of the above colors.  Textures are loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or with gravelly textural modifiers.  It\nhas 0 to 35 percent by volume coarse fragments.\nThe B3t horizon has colors similar to those of the Bx horizon.  Texture is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or with gravelly textural modifier, or very gravelly clay loam.  It has 0\nto 45 percent by volume of coarse fragments.  In some pedons this horizon is lacking.\nSome pedons have C horizons about 1 to 6 inches thick, and has\ncolors similar to the Bx horizon.\nIf present, Cr horizons, about 1 to 4 inches thick, are reddish, brownish, or grayish weathered sandstone.\nThe R horizon is hard level-bedded acid sandstone with few cracks that have horizontal spacing of 6 inches or more."
