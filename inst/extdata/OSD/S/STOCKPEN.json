    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 59 degrees to 65 degrees F. The soil between the depths of about 4 and 12 inches is usually dry in all pats by sometime in May and remains dry until sometime in October. Some or all of this part of the profile is moist all the rest of the time.\nThe A2 horizon is gray or light gray in lOYR hue. It is gravelly loam or gravelly clay loam and has 15 to 20 percent gravel. Reaction is slightly or medium acid.\nThe B2t horizon is gray, dark gray, or grayish brown (l0YR 5/1, 4/1, 5/2). It has medium or strong columnar structure in the upper part.  Gravel content is 15 to 20 percent. Reaction is slightly acid to mildly alkaline in the upper part and mildly to moderately alkaline in lower part. Exchangeable sodium percentage is 15 to 35 percent in all parts of the B2t horizon.\nIn some pedons, gypsum occurs as crystals in the upper portion of the C horizon, especially beneath rock fragments."

Antioch soils have Al horizons more than 13 inches thick.  Bonsall soils lack A2 horizons. Las Flores, Nilpitas, and Tierra soils lack natric horizons. Lethent soils have an aridic moisture regime.  Placentia soils have 5YR or 7.5YR hue in the B2t horizon. Riz soils lack an abrupt A-B horizon boundary with more than 15 percent absolute clay difference. San Miguel soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 34 inches. Solano and Waukena soils have less than 35 percent clay in the natric horizon."

The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm to hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches. Average January temperature is about 53 degrees F., average July temperature is about 71 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F. The frost-free season is 320 to 340 days."
