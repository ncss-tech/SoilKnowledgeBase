    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches.  Depth to continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate is 12 to 24 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The 10- to 40-inch control section is typically gravelly loam, Clay content ranges from 18 to 27 percent.  Limestone and sandstone gravel averages 15 to 35 percent in the control section, but some horizons may contain as much as 60 percent gravel.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry and 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Carbonates range from 15 to 40 percent. It is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  Free carbonates are present but are less than the overlying horizon and decrease rapidly with depth."

The Dioxice soils have slightly hard or hard consistence in the surface horizons and massive calcic horizons to 60 inches or more with fragments of strongly cemented or indurated caliche.  The Havenweep soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches."

The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches, most of which falls in the spring and early summer.  Elevation is 3,500 to 5,000 feet.
