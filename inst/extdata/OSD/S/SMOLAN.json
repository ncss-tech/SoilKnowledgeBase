For landform changed high terrace to paleoterrace which is now more commonly used to describe these old terraces. Added elevation to typical pedon. Added BA to RIC. Added clay content, sand contents, redox, and CCE to RIC of horizons. Updated competing series (deleted Crete).  Updated geographically associated soils to only series associated at original type location or soil survey area.  Changed MAP from 26 to 33 inches to 28 to 36 inches. Added precipitation pattern and FFD to geographic setting. Changed runoff from rapid to high. Added LRR and MLRAs to Distribution and Extent.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL) data available for pedon 99KS161012. An additional site was sampled and sent to Kansas State for analysis (pedon 11KS161101).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
