  "OVERVIEW": "The Schurz series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Schurz soils are on stream terraces and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",

The epipedon fails the moisture criterion of the mollic epipedon required characteristics due to lack of adequate moisture during the growing season.\nAC and C horizons\nHue: 10YR or 2.5Y.\nValue: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.\nChroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist.\nTexture: Ashy fine sandy loam, ashy very fine sandy loam, or ashy loam.\nClay content: 8 to 18 percent.\nStructure: Subangular blocky, platy, or is massive.\nConsistence: Soft to hard dry, very friable to friable, nonsticky to sticky, nonplastic to moderately plastic.\nVolcanic glass content: 30 to 75 percent in the coarse silt through fine sand fractions.\nOther features: Relict redox concentrations of iron or manganese may occur in any subhorizon; Some pedons have thin horizons of ashy silt loam.\n2C horizon\nTexture: Gravelly coarse sand to ashy silty clay loam.\nOther features: Relict redox concentrations of iron or manganese may occur in any subhorizon."

They formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks such as granodiorite and andesite.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,220 to 1,280 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Schurz soils are used for irrigated cropland, rangeland, wildlife habitat, and some urban development.  Alfalfa hay is the main crop.  The vegetation in rangeland on stream terraces is mainly Torrey quailbush, black greasewood, and scattered mature Fremont cottonwoods.  A phase on active flood plains may have a plant community that is riparian cottonwood forest."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This series was on the inactive series list and was not classified using Soil Taxonomy.  The name was originally used in the Report of the Physical Survey of the Walker River Indian Reservation, Schurz, Nevada published by the Soil Conservation Service in May 1940.  The series is being reestablished by mapping it in the same area under a similar concept to the original series.  The reestablished series is now classified to the standard of Soil Taxonomy, 12th edition, 2014.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (Ap and part of the A horizons).\nParticle-size control section and ashy substitute class with glassy mineralogy - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Part of the AC horizon and C1 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Volcanic glass and mica contents determined locally by optical grain count with a polarizing petrographic microscope.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
