Internal drainage appears to be restricted by structure differences in the lower part of the argillic horizon and/or contrasting pore size, resulting in the zone of near saturation during wet periods. Seaton soils, however, will be considered well drained.\nCation-exchange activity class is supported by lab data from National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska.\nClay content in the particle-size control section and lower third of the series control section is based on analysis of laboratory data (NSSL)\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, ninth edition, 2003.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data--National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska many pedons (http://ssldata.sc.egov.usda.gov/)\nLaboratory data--Illinois Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletins 587, 701, and 739.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
