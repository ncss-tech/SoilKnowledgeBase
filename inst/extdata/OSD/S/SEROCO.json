  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10- to 40-inch control section is loamy fine sand, loamy sand or fine sand.  It contains less than 50 percent medium and coarser sand and less than 10 percent by volume of rock fragments.  Depth to carbonates typically is greater than 60 inches but is as shallow as 30 inches in some pedons.  Evidence of recent wind action, such as thin dark layers and variation in texture, are in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or fine sand. Some pedons have AC horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons have finer or coarser materials below depths of 40 inches."

Blanchard and Yecross soils typically contain carbonates higher in the profile.  In addition, Yecross soils contain more than 50 percent medium and coarser sand in the control section.  Kenray soils are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section, periodically, during May and June and moist in some part, periodically, from July through October.  Zilditloi soils are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section during June."

Lihen and Telfer soils are on similar nearby landscapes.  These soils have mollic epipedons.  Parshall, Tally and Vebar soils are on nearby uplands and are coarse-loamy."
