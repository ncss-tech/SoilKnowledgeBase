Mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F. and average summer soil temperature is about 60 degrees F.\nThe A1 horizon has dry value of 4 or 5 and the surface seven inches mixed and rubbed has value less than 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist.\nThe B2t horizon is silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine and coarser sands. It is strongly to very strongly alkaline with estimated 10 to 15 percent exchangeable sodium.\nThe Cca and C2 horizons are strongly to very strongly alkaline and have an estimated 15 to 20 percent exchangeable sodium within a depth of 30 inches. The Cca horizon has estimated CaC03 equivalent of 20 to 30 percent and the C2 horizon has 15 to 20 percent."
