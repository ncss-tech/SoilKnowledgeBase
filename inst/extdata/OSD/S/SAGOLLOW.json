  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sagollow series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in silty and clayey alluvium from mixed sources. These soils are on stream terraces, drainageways and dissected fan remnants and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
