  "OVERVIEW": "The Statemeadow series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in reworked loess and material from basalt with a mantle of mixed loess and volcanic ash. They are on hills and terraces on plateaus. Permeability is moderately slow and slopes range from 5 to 40 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 33 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
