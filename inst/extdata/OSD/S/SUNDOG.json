  "OVERVIEW": "The Sundog series consists of very deep, well drained soils on outwash plains, eskers, crevasse fillings, stream terraces, and moraines.  These soils formed in modified loamy reworked eolian deposits over sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial deposits.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the profile and rapid or very rapid in the lower part.  Slopes range from 1 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the A, E and Bs horizons, 15 to 35 percent in the BC horizon and 0 to 60 percent in the 2C horizon.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 45 percent in the A and E horizons and 0 to 15 percent throughout the remainder of the pedon.   Stone content ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum and moderately acid in the substratum.\nSome pedons have an O horizon with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, or it is neutral.  It has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 1.  The A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, vale of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. The A and E horizons are silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the  cobbly analogs of these textures.\nThe Bs1 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 3 or 4.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together.  The Bs2 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6.  The Bs horizons are silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. The BC horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is gravelly very fine sandy loam or gravelly fine sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 6.  They are sand, coarse sand or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs of these textures."

These soils formed in reworked loamy eolian deposits over sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial deposits.  Slopes are dominantly 1 to 18 percent, but range up to 70 percent.  Steep and very steep slopes are along streams and lakes and on eskers and crevasse fillings.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 34 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 to 43 degrees F."

Present overstory vegetation consists of red maple, quaking and bigtooth aspen, balsam fir, white and black spruce, and some eastern hemlock and sugar maple.  Understory vegetation includes bracken fern, wild lily-of-the-valley, Canada blueberry, wild sarsaparilla, wood betony, and spinulose shield fern, with goldthread, bunchberry, and wood sorrel present on the moderately well drained areas of this soil.  Cleared areas are used for hay, small grain, potatoes, pasture and red pine plantations."
