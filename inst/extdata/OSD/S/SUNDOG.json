  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the A, E and Bs horizons, 15 to 35 percent in the BC horizon and 0 to 60 percent in the 2C horizon.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 45 percent in the A and E horizons and 0 to 15 percent throughout the remainder of the pedon.   Stone content ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum and moderately acid in the substratum.\nSome pedons have an O horizon with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, or it is neutral.  It has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 1.  The A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, vale of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. The A and E horizons are silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the  cobbly analogs of these textures.\nThe Bs1 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 3 or 4.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together.  The Bs2 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6.  The Bs horizons are silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. The BC horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is gravelly very fine sandy loam or gravelly fine sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 6.  They are sand, coarse sand or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs of these textures."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sundog soils are on level to very steep outwash plains, eskers, crevasse fillings, stream terraces, and moraines of Wisconsin age.  These soils formed in reworked loamy eolian deposits over sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial deposits.  Slopes are dominantly 1 to 18 percent, but range up to 70 percent.  Steep and very steep slopes are along streams and lakes and on eskers and crevasse fillings.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 34 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 to 43 degrees F."

The somewhat poorly drained Channing soils, the poorly drained Minocqua soils, and the very poorly drained Cathro soils are in depressions and drainageways."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of this soil supports second growth woodland. Present overstory vegetation consists of red maple, quaking and bigtooth aspen, balsam fir, white and black spruce, and some eastern hemlock and sugar maple.  Understory vegetation includes bracken fern, wild lily-of-the-valley, Canada blueberry, wild sarsaparilla, wood betony, and spinulose shield fern, with goldthread, bunchberry, and wood sorrel present on the moderately well drained areas of this soil.  Cleared areas are used for hay, small grain, potatoes, pasture and red pine plantations."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 4 inches (A horizon); albic horizon - the zone from 4 to 6 inches (E horizon); spodic horizon - the zone from 6 to 15 inches (Bs1 and Bs2 horizons); lithologic discontinuity from reworked loamy eolian material to sandy outwash at 22 inches.  The loamy eolian material has been mixed and reworked due to windthrow modification and postglacial erosion.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
