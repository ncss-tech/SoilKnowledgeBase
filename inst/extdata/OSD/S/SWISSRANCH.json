  "OVERVIEW": "The Swissranch series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium derived from tuff over residuum derived from rhyolite or acidic tuff. The Swissranch soils are on the backslopes and footslopes of high hills. Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1020 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 14 degrees C.",
