  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Swissranch soils are on backslopes and footslopes of high hills. Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from acidic tuff or rhyolite. Elevation is 675 to 975 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 970 to 1190 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 13 to 15 degrees C. The frost free season is 195 to 245 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fuches, Supan, Crozier, McCarthy, and Iron Mountain soils. Fuches soils occupy similar hillslope positions adjacent as Swissranch but are shallow to bedrock. Supan, Iron Mountain, Crozier and McCarthy soils develop on ridges or nearby mountain slopes from basic volcanic rocks including tuff breccia, tuff, or agglomerate. Supan, Crozier, and McCarthy soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Iron Mountain soils are shallow and have a mollic epipedon."
