The soils formed in moderately fine textured calcareous alluvial and eolian sediments.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 to 13 inches of which approximately 8 inches falls during the period from May through October as intense thunderstorms.  The remainder occurs during the period of November through April mainly as snow.  The average annual temperature is about 46 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 125 to 135 days."
