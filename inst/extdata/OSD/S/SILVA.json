  "OVERVIEW": "The Silva series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium and eolian sediments on upland fans and valley fill containing basalt fragments.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The soils formed in moderately fine textured calcareous alluvial and eolian sediments.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 to 13 inches of which approximately 8 inches falls during the period from May through October as intense thunderstorms.  The remainder occurs during the period of November through April mainly as snow.  The average annual temperature is about 46 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 125 to 135 days."
