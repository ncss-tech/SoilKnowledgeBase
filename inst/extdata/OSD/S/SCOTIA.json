  "OVERVIEW": "The Scotia series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glaciofluvial material, with an  admixture of volcanic ash and loess in the upper part.  These soils are on glacial outwash terraces. Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

These soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits of mixed mineralogy  with an admixture of volcanic ash and loess in the upper part.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 35 inches. The mean annual  temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F.

Eloika soils are medial over loamy and mesic.    Moscow soils lack an argillic horizon and have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches."

The upper 13 inches of this pedon has an estimated volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent and 15-bar water retention of less than 12 percent.  This description reflects a change in classification of adding superactive cation exchange activity class."
