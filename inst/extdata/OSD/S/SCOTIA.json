These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F.  The soils are moderately acid to  neutral.  The coarse fragment content in the control section ranges from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe O horizon, where present, and the Ap horizon in cultivated areas, have chroma of 2 or 3 moist.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It is fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe E part of the E and Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist. It is loamy fine sand or loamy sand.\nThe B part of the E and Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and  chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist. It consists of lamellae 1/2 to 3 inches in thickness with a total thickness of 6 to 12 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Scotia soils are on glacial lake terraces at elevations of 2,000 to 3,400 feet.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 25 percent.  These soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits of mixed mineralogy  with an admixture of volcanic ash and loess in the upper part.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 35 inches. The mean annual  temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 115 days."

Eloika soils are medial over loamy and mesic.    Moscow soils lack an argillic horizon and have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches."

The upper 13 inches of this pedon has an estimated volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent and 15-bar water retention of less than 12 percent.
