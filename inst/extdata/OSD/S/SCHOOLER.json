  "OVERVIEW": "The Schooler series consists of soils that are well drained and moderately deep to a duripan that formed in mixed alluvium. They are on basalt plateaus and mesas. Permeability is slow.  Slopes range from 2 to 6 percent. The average annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 14 inches.",
