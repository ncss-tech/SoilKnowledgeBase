The well drained Carmel, Eden, and Edenton soils are also on steeper slopes, have a thinner solum, and are in the fine textural family. The moderately well drained Nicholson and Weisburg soils are on ridgetops and have fragipans. The well drained and moderately well drained Pate soils are on lower lying slopes, have less than 51 cm (20 inches) of loess, and are in the fine textural family."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) in the upper part of the solum and low or moderately low (0.01 to 0.42 micrometers/s) in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very slow in the lower part."
