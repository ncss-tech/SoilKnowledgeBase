    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum is l8 to 30 inches.  These soils are usually moist, but are  dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  By weighted average, rock fragments in the particle-size control section range from 35 to 60 percent pebbles and channers and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.  More than 15 percent of the soil is phyllitic rock fragments.  Soil reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  Some pedons lack an E horizon and have an A horizon.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly loam, very gravelly silt loam, or extremely gravelly silt loam and averages 40 to 70 percent rock fragments.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly loam, very gravelly fine sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly silt loam, or extremely gravelly fine sandy loam and averages 50 to 70 percent rock fragments."

Cupples, Danforth, Natkim, Oakes and Roxer soils have less than l5 percent phyllitic rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Danforth soils also have a udic moisture regime.  Deroux, Littlejohn, Olomount, Rinker, and Winnecook soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Montborne soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact of dense glacial till."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in volcanic ash and glacial till, slope alluvium, and colluvium from phyllite.  The average annual precipitation is 65 to 80 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The January temperature is 33 degrees F; the July temperature is 59 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 120 to 150 days."
