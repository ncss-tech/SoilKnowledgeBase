  "OVERVIEW": "The Sorensen series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and glacial till, slope alluvium, and colluvium from phyllite.  Sorensen soils are on glacially modified mountain sides and have slopes of 3 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 75 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F.",

By weighted average, rock fragments in the particle-size control section range from 35 to 60 percent pebbles and channers and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.  More than 15 percent of the soil is phyllitic rock fragments.  Soil reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  Some pedons lack an E horizon and have an A horizon.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly loam, very gravelly silt loam, or extremely gravelly silt loam and averages 40 to 70 percent rock fragments.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly loam, very gravelly fine sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly silt loam, or extremely gravelly fine sandy loam and averages 50 to 70 percent rock fragments."
