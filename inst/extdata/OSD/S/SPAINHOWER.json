Thermic temperature regime -- assumptions based on preliminary Soil Conservation Service soil/moisture transect, 55 years of local climate records and Bureau of Land Management data.\n5.  Mineralogy -- assumed mixed based on observation of few cracks.\n6.  Clayey-skeletal particle-size class -- 13 to 63 cm control section has 38 percent clay content and 50 percent rock fragments (based on hydrometer method and sieving).\n7.  Moisture regime -- Aridic bordering on Xeric\n7.1 The moisture control section is dry throughout from May 1 to November 15 (200 days).  It is moist throughout from December 1 to April 1 (121 days).\n7.2 The soil temperature exceeds 5 degrees C from February 15 to December 15.  Within this time period the moisture control section is dry from May 1 to November 15 (200 days).\n7.3 The soil temperature exceeds 8.3 degrees C from March 15 to December 1 (260 days), within this time period, the moisture control section is dry from May 1 to November 15 (200 days).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
