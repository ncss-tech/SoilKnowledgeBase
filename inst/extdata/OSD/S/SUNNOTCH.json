Domerir soils are deep to bedrock and have channer shape rock fragments.  Douthit soils have glacial till at 10 to 20 inches and have 5 to 15 percent clay.  Esmeralda soils have a spodic horizon, have fine-earth textures of sandy loam or loam, and 15-bar water on dry samples is 12 to 15 percent.  Howson and Jimek soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Lemah soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 44 to 46 degrees F.  Nomalas soils have less than 30 percent glass and less than 0.4 percent acid oxalate aluminum plus half the iron below a depth of 30 inches."
