  "OVERVIEW": "The Stricker series consists of soils that are well drained and very deep, that formed in colluvium from welded tuff.  They are on breaks.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 360 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C.",
