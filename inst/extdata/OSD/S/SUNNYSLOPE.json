  "OVERVIEW": "The Sunnyslope series consists of shallow well drained soils that formed in residuum from metavolcanic rocks, mainly greenschist.  Sunnyslope soils are on ridge tops and side slopes on metamorphic Sierra Nevada foothills.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, (762 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F, (16 degrees C).",
