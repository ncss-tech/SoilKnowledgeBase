    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 6 to 10 inches.  The soil typically does not have carbonates throughout the profile, but some pedons have carbonates below depths of 40 inches.  Fragments of rock are dominantly cobbles, channers, and flagstones and range from 15 to 30 percent by volume in the surface layer and from 35 to 70 percent by volume in the control section. Depth to consolidated bedrock is at depths of 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, or sandy loam.  It ranges from moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Clay content ranges from 27 to 35 percent.  It ranges from moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 6 and 4 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loam or fine sandy loam and contains 35 to 70 percent by volume of fragments of rock.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 4 to 6.   It is loam, fine sandy loam, and loamy fine sand and contains 35 to 70 percent by volume of fragments of rock.  It is strongly acid to neutral."

Beaverton, Hilger, Shawmut, and the Widtsoe soils have a horizon of carbonate accumulation at the base of the argillic horizon.  Curecanti soils are more than 20 inches deep to the base of the argillic horizon, do not have bedrock at depths above 60 inches and formed in alluvium and glacial outwash. Harol soils have thicker mollic epipedons and less clay and more sand in the C horizon.  Harpole soils contain less clay in the argillic horizon and typically are more alkaline."
