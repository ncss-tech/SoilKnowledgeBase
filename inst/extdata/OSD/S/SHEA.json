  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the human-manufactured layer (M horizon) ranges from 25 to 50 centimeters from the soil surface. The human transported soil materials may be sourced from any geologic deposit ranging from till, outwash, alluvium, coastal plain sediments, or residuum, usually from a very local source. Total coarse fragments range from 0 to 25 percent, with human artifacts typically ranging from 0 to 10 percent. Textures range from sandy loam to silt loam, with occasional discrete layers of coarse-textured materials. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nHue colors range from 5YR to 2.5Y throughout.\nThe ^A or ^Ap horizon in the human transported soil have value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 6. It is defined by weak subangular blocky or granular structure and organic matter accumulation. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe ^B horizons, when present, have value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. Structure is subangular blocky, and fine roots are generally common to many. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe M horizon is asphalt, concrete, coal slag or other anthropogenic material. It is rigid and weatherable only over extended periods of time. The horizon designation will vary depending on the nature of the rigid layer.\nThe ^C or ^Cu horizons have value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8, but may have a hue of N and chroma of 2.5 if the soil occurs in coal slag materials. Structure is massive or single grain and may have plate-like divisions. Consistence is loose to firm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Shea soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping artificially modified landforms. These soils formed in loamy human transported materials underlain by a nearly impermeable layer of asphalt, concrete, or other cemented human-manufactured material. The human transported material is relatively clean of refuse, with less than 10 percent pieces of plastic, glass, bricks, concrete, and metal. The dominant rock fragments are derived mainly from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 17 degrees Celsius. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1021 to 1325 millimeters."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: The soils are well drained. The potential for surface runoff is low to medium on vegetated slopes less than 8 percent, and high to very high on vegetated slopes 8 percent and greater. The potential for surface runoff is one class higher where the soil is unvegetated or the surface is poorly protected from erosion. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high, but can be moderately low in the surface where affected by compaction or beneath the human-manufactured layer."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are commonly used for recreational purposes. Shea soils are generally covered with common weeds, common reed, and mugwort if deposited in sunny locations; by turfgrass in recreational areas; and native forest understory plants if deposited in a shady location. Trees quickly spread lateral roots into fill areas deposited near them. The more compacted areas support sparse populations of various grasses, annuals, and perennials that invade disturbed areas. The looser dumps are quickly covered with early succession hardwood seedlings from nearby sources."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Shea soils are mapped in the soil survey areas of the Gateway National Recreation Area and the New York City Reconnaissance Soil Survey, as well as the initial survey areas of Kings and Queens Counties NY.  The soils are of minimal extent (less than 1,000 acres); however they are of unique importance to users of the soil surveys.\nShea soils often exhibit an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth however this is a result of anthropogenic filling (deposition) not alluvial deposition; excluding them from the concept of Fluventic Eutrudepts. Proposed revisions to soil taxonomy in ICOMANTH Circular Letter 7 developed for anthropogenic soils will help to clarify this difference.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric Epipedon - the zone from 0 8 centimeters.\nb. Cambic horizon - the horizon from 8 to 28 centimeters;\nc. Shallow family- human-manufactured materials (M horizon) - rigid asphalt layer from 28 to 40 centimeters.\nd. CEC activity class is estimated as active.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
