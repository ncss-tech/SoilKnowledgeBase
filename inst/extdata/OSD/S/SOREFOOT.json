  "OVERVIEW": "The Sorefoot series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in clayey alluvium weathered from tuffaceous sediment of the John Day and Clarno Formations.  They are on alluvial fans.  Slopes are 1 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
