  "OVERVIEW": "The Starlite series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in lacustrine sediments.  Starlite soils are in basins and on valley flats. Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
