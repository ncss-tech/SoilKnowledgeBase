  "OVERVIEW": "The Satsuma series consists of somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed loess and loamy stream terrace deposits of Late Pleistocene Age.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the subsoil and slow in the lower part of the subsoil.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 70 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid, throughout the solum, except the A horizon in areas that have been limed.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 to 3.  Where the color value is 3, the A horizon is less than 6 inches thick.\nThe E horizon, where present, and the E part of the Bt/E horizon, have hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe EB or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles, in shades of brown or gray, range from few to many.\nThe Bt part of the Bt/E horizon and the Btn1 horizon have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. They are mottled in shades of brown, gray or red.  Mottles with chroma of 2 or less range from few to many.  Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe 2Bt, 2Btn, 2Btnx, and 2BCn horizons have the same range in colors as the Btn1 horizon.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, or loam. Firm and brittle bodies make up 10 to 40 percent of the horizontal cross section of the 2Btnx horizon.\nWhere present, the 2C horizon has the same range in colors as the 2Btn, 2Btnx, and 2BCn horizons.  Texture is loam or sandy loam."
