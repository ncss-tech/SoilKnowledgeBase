These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 90 to 105 consecutive days during summer and fall.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 14 inches thick and may include part of the natric horizon.  Depth to the calcic horizon is 15 to 40 inches.  Depth to lithic contact with basalt is 40 to more than 60 inches.  Some phases have duripan at 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist, 1 to 3 dry.  It is massive, subangular blocky or weak granular structure.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.  It has 10 to 15 percent clay.\nThe Btn horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It has weak to strong prismatic, columnar structure or subangular blocky structure.  It is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  SAR is 13 to 40.  It has 20 to 30 percent clay.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 4 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  It is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline."

Individual bodies range in size mainly from 1/4 acre to about 5 acres.  The soils formed in loess.  Summers are warm and dry, and winters are cool and moist.  Average annual precipitation is mostly 12 to 15 inches, but some is as high as 20 inches.  Average January temperature is 29 to 32 degrees F, average July temperature is 69 to 73 degrees F, and mean annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 110 to 165 days."
