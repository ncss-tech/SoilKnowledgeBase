  "STATES": "NY,PA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Shongo series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in colluvium from interbedded shale, siltstone and fine-grained sandstone.  They are nearly level to sloping soils on footslopes, upland hillsides, benches, and saddles.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Permeability is moderate in the upper solum and moderately slow in the lower solum and substratum.  Mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.",

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The only competing series at this time is the Napoli (T) series in the same family.  Napoli soils developed in glacial till parent material, and contain granite glacial erratics.\nThe Abbottstown, Buckingham, Gresham, Portville, Ravenna and Venango series are in related families.  Abbottstown is deep to bedrock and is formed in red residual material.  Buckingham soilsare Northern Piedmont soils derived from red and gray metamorphic parent material and allow 5YR hue in the solum.  Gresham, Ravenna, and Venango soils have glacial till parent material.  Portville soils have mesic temperature regimes.  Other related families include the Carrollton, Dusler, Freer, Frewsburg, Keewatin, Simoda, Stuntz, and Trussel series are in related families.  Carrollton and Frewsburg soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Dusler, Freer, Keewatin, and Stuntz soils have tongues of albic material in the argillic horizon.  Simoda and Trussel soils lack an argillic horizon.  Gilpin and Blairton soils are related series that have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches, and have mesic temperature regimes."
