  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The only competing series at this time is the Napoli (T) series in the same family.  Napoli soils developed in glacial till parent material, and contain granite glacial erratics.\nThe Abbottstown, Buckingham, Gresham, Portville, Ravenna and Venango series are in related families.  Abbottstown is deep to bedrock and is formed in red residual material.  Buckingham soilsare Northern Piedmont soils derived from red and gray metamorphic parent material and allow 5YR hue in the solum.  Gresham, Ravenna, and Venango soils have glacial till parent material.  Portville soils have mesic temperature regimes.  Other related families include the Carrollton, Dusler, Freer, Frewsburg, Keewatin, Simoda, Stuntz, and Trussel series are in related families.  Carrollton and Frewsburg soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Dusler, Freer, Keewatin, and Stuntz soils have tongues of albic material in the argillic horizon.  Simoda and Trussel soils lack an argillic horizon.  Gilpin and Blairton soils are related series that have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches, and have mesic temperature regimes."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soil developed in colluvium from interbedded shale, siltstone and fine-grained sandstone.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 46 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches, and the growing season ranges from 100 to 120 days.  These soils are mostly\nat elevations of 1800 to 2400 feet."

The Brinkerton, Buchanan, Carrollton, Eldred, Elko, Frewsburg, and Ivory soils are on related landscapes. Brinkerton, and Buchanan soils are at lower elevations and are in mesic temperature regimes.  Carrollton and Frewsburg soils have bedrock of 20 to 40 inches.  Eldred and Elko soils are moderately well drained.  Ivory soils have a fine particle size control section."
