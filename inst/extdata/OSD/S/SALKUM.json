  "OVERVIEW": "The Salkum series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in very strongly weathered ancient glacial drift.  Salkum soils are on hills, terraces, and terrace escarpments and have slopes of 0 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 55 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature at depths of 20 inches ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  Solum thickness ranges from 48 to 70 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 40 to 55 percent clay by weight, 0 to 10 percent hard, pebble-size rock fragments by volume.\nThe Ac horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  These horizons have strong or moderate medium to fine granular or subangular blocky structure.  It is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe ABc horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 3 through 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist or dry.  Depth to mottles with chroma of 2 or less exceeds 36 inches.  The Bt horizon is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay and ranges from 35 to 60 percent clay.  It has moderate or strong subangular and angular blocky structure.  This horizon is moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nThe C horizon, where present, is mottled and has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 7 moist or dry, and chroma of 1 through 8 moist or dry.  This horizon ranges from silty clay loam to clay and contains strongly weathered soft pebbles."
