    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Salkum soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days within the 3 months following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature at depths of 20 inches ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  Solum thickness ranges from 48 to 70 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 40 to 55 percent clay by weight, 0 to 10 percent hard, pebble-size rock fragments by volume.\nThe Ac horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  These horizons have strong or moderate medium to fine granular or subangular blocky structure.  It is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe ABc horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 3 through 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist or dry.  Depth to mottles with chroma of 2 or less exceeds 36 inches.  The Bt horizon is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay and ranges from 35 to 60 percent clay.  It has moderate or strong subangular and angular blocky structure.  This horizon is moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nThe C horizon, where present, is mottled and has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 7 moist or dry, and chroma of 1 through 8 moist or dry.  This horizon ranges from silty clay loam to clay and contains strongly weathered soft pebbles."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Salkum soils formed in very strongly weathered ancient glacial drift on glacial hills, terraces, and terrace escarpments at elevations of 200 to 1,000 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  Salkum soils are in a marine climate with 40 to 70 inches average annual precipitation occurring mostly as rain during the winter.  Mean January temperature is 37 degrees F, mean July temperature is 65 degrees F, and average annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  Frost-free season (32 degrees F) is 150 to 200 days.  Growing season (28 degrees F) is 175 to 240 days."

Melbourne and Scamman soils have a base saturation of more than 35 percent at a depth of 1.25 meters below the upper boundary of the argillic horizon.  Olympic soils ave mixed mineralogy.  Scamman soils also have colors with chroma of 2 or less in the B horizon."
