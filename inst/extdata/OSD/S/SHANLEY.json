  "OVERVIEW": "The Shanley series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium or colluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces, structural benches, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
