  "OVERVIEW": "The San Anton series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on flood plains. They formed in stratified alluvial deposits that weathered from volcanic rock and limestone.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature about 79 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation about 37 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.",
