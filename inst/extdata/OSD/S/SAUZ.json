  "OVERVIEW": "The Sauz series consists of very deep; poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy eolian deposits derived from Holocene age sediments.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on coastal plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).",

The series was revised to accurately reflect the laboratory report during the Soil Data Join and Recorrelation initiative in 2016. The surface texture was left as a loamy fine sand as the delineation this site is in was correlated to a loamy fine sand phase. In addition, the previous version had incorrect geocoordinates to the type location.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 18 to 69 cm (7 to 27 in). (Btnz1 and Btnz2 horizon)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 in). (A horizon)\nNatric horizon: 18 to 102 cm (7 to 40 in). (Btnz1, Btnz2, and Btknz horizons)\nAquic conditions: 0 to 102 cm (0 to 40 in) of saturation and reducing conditions\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL data from Brooks County, TX (S79TX-047-002) and from Willacy County, TX (S79TX-489-001).\nTaxonomic Version:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
