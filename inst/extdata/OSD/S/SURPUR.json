  "OVERVIEW": "The Surpur series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated tectonically uplifted fluvial, beach, and dune deposits derived from mixed sources. Surpur soils are on mountains and have slopes of 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2030 millimeters (80 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated tectonically uplifted fluvial, beach, and dune deposits derived from mixed sources. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1780 to 2550 millimeters (70 to 100 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F).
