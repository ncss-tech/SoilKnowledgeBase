  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Surpur soils occur on ridges and upper, mountain slopes. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. Elevations are 233 to 690 meters (760 to 2260 feet). The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated tectonically uplifted fluvial, beach, and dune deposits derived from mixed sources. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1780 to 2550 millimeters (70 to 100 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is 240 to 280 days."
