  "OVERVIEW": "The Sluka series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in old alluvium from mixed sources.  The Sluka soils are on old dissected terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 50 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
