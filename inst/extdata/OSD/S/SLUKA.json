Chuska and Yahoo soils are shallow to a duripan.  Purdam soils have fine-silty argillic horizons.  Rakane soils have fine-loamy argillic horizons.  All the above soils are on the same landform as Sluka.  Tulch soils do not have a duripan, have fine-silty control sections, and are on lower terraces and larger drainageways."
