  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sigurd series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium dominantly from limestone and sandstone.  Sigurd soils occur on alluvial fans, inset fans, fan skirts, and flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.",
