  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sandwick series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in a mantle of sandy glacial outwash or eolian material and underlying loamy till or lacustrine sediments. These soils are on lake plains or moraines. They have rapid permeability in the upper sandy mantle and moderately slow permeability in the underlying material. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches.",

Rock fragments in loamy material range from 2 to 10 percent by volume. They are mainly gravel or cobblestone size, but some pedons contain boulders. In some pedons there is a thin gravelly lag line at the juncture of materials 1 and 2.\nSome pedons have thin 0 or A1 horizons or both.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 3, or value of 4 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand. It is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 10Y to 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It has faint or distinct redoximorphic features. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, fine sand, or coarse sand. It is slightly acid to strongly acid. Some pedons have a Bw horizon.\nThe E'1 and 2E'2 horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value or 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. They have distinct or prominent redoximorphic features. The E'1 horizon has textures like the E or Bs horizons. The 2E' horizon is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.

It has high chroma redoximorphic features. It is loam, clay loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam. It has continuous to common, thin, and moderately thick clay films on the faces of peds and in root channels.

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 10 inches (E and Bs horizons); albic horizon - the zone from 0 to 4 inches (E horizon) and from 10 to 28 inches (E'1, 2E'2 horizons); glossic horizon - the zone from 25 to 28 inches (2E/B horizon);argillic horizon - the zone from 28 to 38 inches (2Btg1 and 2Btg2 horizons); arenic subgroup per sandy texture in upper 22 inches; aquic moisture regime per low chroma of argillic horizon; glossic characteristics due to tonguing of E' into the 2Bt horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: See Minnesota Ag. Exp. Station Central File Code 2630 for data on a representative pedon. Additional field study may show this series could be classified as sandy over loamy, mixed, frigid Alfic Endoaquods.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
