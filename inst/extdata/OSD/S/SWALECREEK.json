  "OVERVIEW": "The Swalecreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from basalt mixed with loess. Swalecreek soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments on plateaus and in drainageway escarpments on hills. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
