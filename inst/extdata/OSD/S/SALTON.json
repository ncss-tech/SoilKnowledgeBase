  "OVERVIEW": "The Salton series is a member of the fine-silty, mixed (calcareous), hyperthermic family of Aquic Torriorthents.  Typically, Salton soils are light brownish gray and light gray, stratified, calcareous, silty clay loam, silty clay and clay more than 60 inches deep.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  There are very few if any coarse fragments present.  The average annual soil temperature is above 72 degrees F.  The soils are usually wet.  The soils are calcareous in all parts.  Colors of all strata are dominantly lithochromatic.  There is no consistent change in color from the surface downward.  Hues are 10YR or yellower.  Dry value is 5 through 7 and moist value 4 through 6.  Chroma is 2 or less.  Texture of the 10-to 40-inch zone averages silty clay loam with less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand and with about 27 to 35 percent clay.  Thin strata 1/4 to 2 inches in thickness of loamy fine sand to fine sandy loam texture occur at random throughout the profile."

The parent material consists of fine and moderately fine \"silty\" recent alluvium derived from a variety of rock sources.  The average annual rainfall is less than 4 inches, the average January temperature is about 53 degrees F., the average July temperature is about 92 degrees F., and the average annual temperature is about 72 degrees F."

Coachella soils are sands and loamy sands with silt lenses.  Gilman and Indio soils have less than 18 percent clay in the 10-to 40-inch section.  Imperial soils have a fine control section."

Under irrigation tile drainage is needed to remove soluble salts and to maintain water tables below a 4 to 5 foot depth.  Water tables have been rising in some areas, as along the shores of the Salton Sea."
