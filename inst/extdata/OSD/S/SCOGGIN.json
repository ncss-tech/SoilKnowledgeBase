  "OVERVIEW": "The Scoggin series consists of very poorly drained soils formed in loamy and sandy marine sediments on the low Coastal Plain in central Peninsular Florida.  They occur in swamps and low areas bordering swamps.  They are covered with standing water for as much as 6 months in most years beginning in the summer rainy season.  Slope is less than 1 percent.",

Soil reaction is extremely acid to slightly acid in the A horizon and very strongly acid to strongly acid in the Oa horizon and the argillic horizon.\nThe Oa horizon is in hue of 5YR, value 2 or 3, chroma 2 to 4; hue of 10YR, value 2, chroma 1; or hue N, value 2, chroma 0.\nThe A horizon is 20 to 40 inches thick.  It is sand or fine sand.  The A1 has hue of 10YR or N, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 0.  Thickness ranges from 5 to 14 inches; where the value is 3.5\nor less, the thickness is less than 10.  The A2 horizon has hue of 10YR, or N, value 4 to 8, chroma of 2 or 1.  Fine mottles in shades of brown and gray may be present.\nThe Btg horizon is in hue of 10YR or N, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or less; hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2.  Few to many, fine to coarse, faint to distinct yellowish and brownish mottles may occur.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Cg horizon is in hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma 1 or less; hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture ranges from fine sandy loam to fine sand with discontinuous strata of finer or coarser material."
