  "OVERVIEW": "The Shaboom series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum, slope alluvium or colluvium from coarse grained igneous bedrock.  These soils are on escarpments, ridges and sideslopes of hills.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
