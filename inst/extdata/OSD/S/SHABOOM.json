  "OVERVIEW": "The Shaboom series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum, slope alluvium or colluvium from coarse grained igneous bedrock.  These soils are on escarpments, ridges and sideslopes of hills.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
