  "OVERVIEW": "The Solo series consists of moderately deep to weakly cemented lahar, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvially deposited volcanic ash and pumice overlying weakly cemented lahar.  They are on terraces and fans at elevations of 400 to 1,600 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 80 inches and average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
