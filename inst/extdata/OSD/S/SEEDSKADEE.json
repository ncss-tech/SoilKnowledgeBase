  "OVERVIEW": "This series consists of well-drained, light-colored, moderately fine textured, mildly to moderately alkaline, thin Sierozem soils developing in moderately coarse textured, calcareous parent materials weathered residually from sandstone and interbedded shales.  Typically they have light-colored, granular A horizons, B2t horizons having prismatic and subangular blocky structure, and weak to moderate ca horizons.  They resemble the soils of the Saddle series but differ in having bedrock at 18 inches or less.  They differ from the Travessilla and Ocean Lake series in having B2t horizons.  They differ from the Worland series in having a B2t horizon and in having bedrock at 18 inches or less.  At their type location they have an average annual precipitation of 8 inches, and average annual air temperature of 38 degrees F., and an average summer air temperature of 60 degrees F.  These are relatively inextensive soils and only moderately important agriculturally.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Color of the A1 horizon may range in hue from 2.5Y to 10YR, in chroma from 1.5 to 3, and in value from 5 to 6 dry and 4 to 5 moist.  Color of the B2t horizon may range in hue from 2.5Y to 7.5YR, in chroma from 2 to 4, and in value from 5 to 6 dry and 4 to 5 moist.  Reaction of the A and B2t horizons range from pH 7.0 to pH 8.0.  Calcium carbonate equivalent of the ca horizon is typically about 5 percent but may range from 2 to 12 percent.  Texture of the B2t horizon is typically a light sandy clay loam or heavy sandy loam but may range in clay from 10 to 25 percent, in silt from 5 to 30 percent, and in sand from 50 to 80 percent.  Content of coarse channery and flagstone fragments range from 5 to 20 percent.  Depth to noncalcareous material ranges from 6 to 14 inches, thickness of solum ranges from 8 to 18 inches, and depth to bedrock ranges from 8 to 18 inches."
