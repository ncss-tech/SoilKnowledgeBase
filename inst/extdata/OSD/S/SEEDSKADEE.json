    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Color of the A1 horizon may range in hue from 2.5Y to 10YR, in chroma from 1.5 to 3, and in value from 5 to 6 dry and 4 to 5 moist.  Color of the B2t horizon may range in hue from 2.5Y to 7.5YR, in chroma from 2 to 4, and in value from 5 to 6 dry and 4 to 5 moist.  Reaction of the A and B2t horizons range from pH 7.0 to pH 8.0.  Calcium carbonate equivalent of the ca horizon is typically about 5 percent but may range from 2 to 12 percent.  Texture of the B2t horizon is typically a light sandy clay loam or heavy sandy loam but may range in clay from 10 to 25 percent, in silt from 5 to 30 percent, and in sand from 50 to 80 percent.  Content of coarse channery and flagstone fragments range from 5 to 20 percent.  Depth to noncalcareous material ranges from 6 to 14 inches, thickness of solum ranges from 8 to 18 inches, and depth to bedrock ranges from 8 to 18 inches."
