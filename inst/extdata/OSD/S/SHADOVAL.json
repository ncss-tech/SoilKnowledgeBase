  "OVERVIEW": "The Shadoval series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with very slow permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from lacustrine deposits. Shadoval soils are on foothills and have slopes of 4 to 50 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
