Hamlet has been reclassified as Aquic Hapludolls.\nIn areas near to Glacial Lake Souris, the till appears to have been reworked by water action with lenses of silts and fine sands observed in some pedons. This area may need further investigation.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nPedon 2016ND075021 is the type location.\nLaboratory data--pedons S1949ND075011, S1950ND075002, S1950ND075008 provide some additional accompanying data.\nS50NDak-38-5, S49NDak-38-6 Soil Survey Investigations No.2, pages 2-3, and pages 238-239.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
