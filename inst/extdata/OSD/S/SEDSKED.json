Berit and Soar soils are on granitic bedrock. Flex soils are slightly acid or neutral. Ginex soils have secondary carbonates in the argillic horizon. Stodick soils have a paralithic contact at 36 to 50 cm. Ravenell soils have 35 to 45 percent clay in the argillic horizon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sedsked soils are on plateaus.  They typically occur on shoulder and backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from metasedimentary rock.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 4,500 to 5,940 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 cm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
