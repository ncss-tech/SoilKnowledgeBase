  "OVERVIEW": "The Sedsked series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from metasedimentary rock.  Sedsked soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",

Berit and Soar soils are on granitic bedrock. Flex soils are slightly acid or neutral. Ginex soils have secondary carbonates in the argillic horizon. Stodick soils have a paralithic contact at 36 to 50 cm. Ravenell soils have 35 to 45 percent clay in the argillic horizon."
