  "OVERVIEW": "The Snowbrier series consists of moderately deep, well drained\nsoils that formed in colluvium weathered from shist.  Snowbrier\nsoils are on ridges and hillslopes and have slopes of 25 to 50 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F, and\nthe mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches.",
