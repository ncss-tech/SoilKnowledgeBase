  "OVERVIEW": "The Solsberry series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are shallow or moderately deep to a fragipan. The Solsberry soils formed in loess, loamy materials, and in the underlying paleosol in till. They are on dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 6 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
