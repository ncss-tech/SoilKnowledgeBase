Apalona, Nicholson, and Zanesville soils are formed loess and residuum. Ava, Boston, Cincinnati, Grantsburg, Hosmer, Lawrenceville, Omulga, Otwell, Otwood, and Weisburg soils do not have a subhorizon on the lower part of the series control section that averages 15 percent or more sandstone channers. Bedford soils have more than 45 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Fountainville soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Hildebrecht soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the fragipan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Solsberry soils are on shoulders and backslopes of dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 6 to 18 percent. The soils formed in loess, loamy materials, and in the underlying paleosol in till. The till has rock fragments of mixed lithology, but dominantly of sandstone. Interbedded sandstone, siltstone, and shale bedrock is typically at depths of 203 to 254 cm (80 to 100 inches). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1067 to 1143 mm (42 to 45 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 12 to 13 degrees C (53 to 56 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 170 to 200 days."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 46 to 76 cm (1.5 to 2.5 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part of the subsoil and low in the fragipan. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the subsoil and very slow within the fragipan."
