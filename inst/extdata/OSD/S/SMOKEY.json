    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Base saturation is less than 60 percent throughout the profile.  The epipedon is ochric either because moist chromas are greater than 3.5 or it is too thin to be mollic or umbric.  Stones and cobbles range from 0 to 20 percent and gravel ranges from 10 to 60 percent throughout the profile.  Concentration of gravel increases with depth.  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 46 degrees F.  The soil is usually moist but is dry in all parts between depths of 10 to 24 inches from late July until early October.  Reaction is medium acid to very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 5/3, 4/3, 3/3; 7.5YR 5/4, 4/4, or 4/3 dry, and 10YR 3/3, 3/2; 7.5YR 5/4, 5/3; 5YR 5/4, or 4/4, 3/2, 3/4 moist.  It is sandy loam silt loam or loam and may be gravelly or very gravelly.\nThe Bt horizon has color of 10YR 6/4, 6/6, 5/4, 5/6; 7.5YR 6/4, 5/4 or 4/4 dry and 10YR 5/6, 5/4; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4; 5YR 4/6, or 5/6 moist.  It is loam or silt loam and is gravelly or very gravelly.\nThe C horizon has color of 10YR 7/6, 6/6, 6/4, 6/3 or 7.5YR 4/4 dry and 10YR 6/6, 5/6, 6/4, or 6/3 moist.  It is silt loam, sandy loam or loam modified by 40 to 60 percent gravel."
