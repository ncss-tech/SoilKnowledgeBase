    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum is 30 to 60 inches. Depth to a paralithic contact is 40 to 80 inches. Flat fragments of siltstone and sandstone less than 6 inches in length are 2 to 35 percent in the Ap horizon and Bt horizon; and weathered fragments of shale or siltstone are 2 to 75 percent in the 2BC and 2C horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of l0YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 3 to 5 moist (5 to 7 dry); and chroma of 3 or 4. Value of 3 (5 dry) are in horizons less than 7 inches thick. Some pedons have an A horizon up to 4 inches thick that has hue of l0YR or 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 2 to 4. The Ap or A horizon commonly is silt loam, but ranges to loam and channery analogues of these textures. It is strongly acid or very strongly acid unless limed.\nSome pedons have an E horizon that has hue of l0YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 2 to 4. It has similar texture and reaction range as the Ap or A horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR (at least one subhorizon has hue of 5YR or redder); value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 to 6. Some pedons are not mottled in the lower part. The Bt commonly is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or channery analogues of these textures. It is extremely acid to medium acid in the upper part and very strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part.\nSome pedons have a 2Bt horizon up to 24 inches thick. The 2BC horizon (or 2Bt) and 2C horizons commonly have color range similar to the Bt horizon; but range to hue of l0YR or l0R. They are silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or clay loam; or shaly to extremely shaly analogues, of these textures. They are very strongly acid to slightly acid except for the C horizon that ranges to neutral. Thin strata of coarser textures from weathered sandstone are in some pedons.\nBedrock is interbedded, fractured siltstone or fine-grained sandstone and soft, red clay shale."

Amanda, Coggon, Hayden, Hickory, Kendallville, Kidder, Leroy, Lindley, McHenry, Miami, Owosso, Pecatonica, Renova, Riddles, Roseville, Strawn, Theresa, Wawasee, Westville, Woodbine, and Wykoff soils have glacial drift within a depth of 40 inches and have coarse fragments of mixed lithology including some crystalline rocks. Belmont soils commonly are not as acid in the lower part of the solum and have coarse fragments mainly of limestone and are underlain by a lithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Belmore, Chenault, Chili, Douds, El Dara, Gallman, Kalamazoo, Kanawha, Kosciusko, Martinsville, Nodine, Ockley, and Sisson soils have evidence of stratification or have rounded coarse fragments. Conestoga, Hollinger, and Letort soils have a significant mica content. Grellton soils have loamy B horizons, silty 2B horizons and loamy 3B and 3C horizons that have glacial erratics. Hebron soils lack shale fragments in the 2B and 2C horizons. High Gap, Military, Norden, and Whalan soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Mandeville soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Mifflin and Princeton soils lack coarse fragments. Rawson soils formed in loamy outwash and the underlying clayey till or lacustrine sediments and lack flat fragments from sedimentary bedrock. Relay soils have hues of 2.5Y or yellower, and in addition, are high in magnesium. Richland and Skelton soils lack subhorizons with hue of 5YR or redder."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Summitville soils are on side slopes, benches, and less commonly on summits. Slope gradients range from 2 to 70 percent. The soils formed in mixed loamy materials from interbedded red clay shale, yellowish siltstone, and sandstone resulting from colluviation or solifluction; and in the underlying residuum weathered from similar materials. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 38 to 42 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from about 49 to 55 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Berks, Dekalb, Gilpin, Upshur, Weikert, Wellston, Woodsfield, and Zanesville soils. Berks, Dekalb, Gilpin, and Weikert soils commonly are on back slopes and upper shoulders or on narrow, sloping interfluves. Berks, Dekalb, and Weikert soils are loamy-skeletal, whereas Gilpin soils are fine-loamy. In addition, Berks and Dekalb soils are moderately deep to bedrock and Weikert soils are shallow. Upshur soils are on summits or side slopes and formed in red clayey residuum from shale. Wellston, Woodsfield, and Zanesville soils typically are on fairly broad, gently sloping ridgetops that have a mantle of loess."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Classification was adjusted to agree with ST Issue #17 on 22 Sept 94 by CLG.\nThe 01/2006 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). The CEC activity class placement is based on NASIS data elements for Jefferson County, Ohio, and on associated soils, but not on laboratory data. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available.\nCompeting series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 6 inches (Ap horizon)\nb. Argillic horizon--the zone from 6 to 35 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons)\nc. Oxyaquic subgroupredoximorphic features within 40 inches of the surface\nd. Lithologic discontinuity at 41 inches (top of 2BC2 horizon)\ne. Paralithic contact at 77 inches (top of 2Cr horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to pedon CO-95 for characterization data on the typical pedon.\nPrevious revision dates: 02/87-DRM\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
