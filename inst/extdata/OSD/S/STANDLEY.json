  "OVERVIEW": "The Standley series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous, gravelly and cobbly alluvial materials derived from mixed sources.  Standley soils are on terraces, alluvial fans, ridges, and valley side slopes and have slopes of 0 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent by volume in the solum and are mainly 1/8 to 3 inches in diameter but include 3 to 10 inch in diameter fragments.  Coarse fragments are rounded.  Calcium carbonate equivalent in the B3ca and Cca ranges from 5 to 25 percent.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.  Textures are modified with gravel, cobble and/or stone coarse fragments.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.  It is gravelly clay loam or gravelly clay.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 50 percent.\nThe C horizon, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 8, 4 through 7 moist and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is gravelly loam, gravelly clay loam, gravelly sandy clay loam or cobbly sandy clay loam."
