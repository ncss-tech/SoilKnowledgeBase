Calcium carbonate equivalent in the B3ca and Cca ranges from 5 to 25 percent.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.  Textures are modified with gravel, cobble and/or stone coarse fragments.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.  It is gravelly clay loam or gravelly clay.
