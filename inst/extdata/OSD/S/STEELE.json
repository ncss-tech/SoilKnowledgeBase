  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the soil to clayey substratum ranges from 20 to 36 inches. Reaction is medium acid to neutral in the sandy material and slightly acid or neutral in the clayey material.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, 5.5 or higher when dry, and chroma of 2 or 3, 1 through 3 dry. It is loamy sand, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe C1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 or 3. It ranges from coarse sand to loamy fine sand.\nThe C2g horizon, where present, ranges from loam to sandy loam with color value and chroma similar to those of the C1 horizon but including 2.5Y and 5Y hues and mottles.\nThe 2Ab horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 2 through 5 and chroma of 1 or 2. It ranges from silty clay loam to clay.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 with higher chroma mottles. Textures are commonly silty clay or clay below 48 inches. Silty clay loam with clay content greater than 35 percent is within the range."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. The Bruno, Clana, Crevasse, Kenmoor, Malden, Sarpy, and Scotco series are in similar families. Bruno, Clana, Crevasse, Malden, Sarpy, and Scotco soils lack clayey textures within the particle size control section. Kenmoor and Sarpy soils are mesic."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on level to undulating areas of flood plains and commonly are in narrow bands paralleling overflow channels. Slope gradients range from 0 to 5 percent. Large areas of Steele soils are not common. Steele soils formed in sandy and clayey river deposits. Most areas are protected from overflow. Mean annual temperature ranges from 58 to 64 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 45 to 55 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Bruno, Clana, and Crevasse and the Alligator, Commerce, Hayti, Portageville, Sharkey, Caruthersville, Robinsonville, and Cooter soils. Bruin and Mhoon soils are possible associates in some areas. These soils lack sandy textures in the upper part of the sola. They occur on flood plains but the Alligator, Commerce, Cooter, Hayti, Mhoon, and Sharkey soils are on nearly level or depressional areas below the Steele soils. The Bruin, Caruthersville, Portageville, and Robinsonville soils are on slightly higher parts of the flood plain or lower terraces."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Negligible or very low runoff because of the sandy surface horizons. The upper part of the soil is rapidly permeable, and the lower part is slowly permeable. During wet periods these soils are saturated within 20 inches of the surface for periods of several days."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly cropped to soybeans, cotton, and corn. They are rarely the dominant soils in a given field and are therefore farmed the same as adjacent soils. Native vegetation was mixed hardwoods."

They are essentially deep overwashes of such soils as Hayti, Cooter, and Sharkey but cannot be considered as overwash phases since the thickness is more than 20 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
