  "REVDATE": "10/2018",
  "STATES": "AR,MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Steele series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy and clayey river deposits on level to undulating areas of flood plains and commonly are in narrow bands paralleling overflow channels. The upper part of the soil is rapidly permeable, and the lower part has slow permeability. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the soil to clayey substratum ranges from 20 to 36 inches. Reaction is medium acid to neutral in the sandy material and slightly acid or neutral in the clayey material.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, 5.5 or higher when dry, and chroma of 2 or 3, 1 through 3 dry. It is loamy sand, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe C1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 or 3. It ranges from coarse sand to loamy fine sand.\nThe C2g horizon, where present, ranges from loam to sandy loam with color value and chroma similar to those of the C1 horizon but including 2.5Y and 5Y hues and mottles.\nThe 2Ab horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 2 through 5 and chroma of 1 or 2. It ranges from silty clay loam to clay.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 with higher chroma mottles. Textures are commonly silty clay or clay below 48 inches. Silty clay loam with clay content greater than 35 percent is within the range."

Bruno, Clana, Crevasse, Malden, Sarpy, and Scotco soils lack clayey textures within the particle size control section. Kenmoor and Sarpy soils are mesic."

Slope gradients range from 0 to 5 percent. Large areas of Steele soils are not common. Steele soils formed in sandy and clayey river deposits. Most areas are protected from overflow. Mean annual temperature ranges from 58 to 64 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 45 to 55 inches."

Bruin and Mhoon soils are possible associates in some areas. These soils lack sandy textures in the upper part of the sola. They occur on flood plains but the Alligator, Commerce, Cooter, Hayti, Mhoon, and Sharkey soils are on nearly level or depressional areas below the Steele soils. The Bruin, Caruthersville, Portageville, and Robinsonville soils are on slightly higher parts of the flood plain or lower terraces."

The upper part of the soil is rapidly permeable, and the lower part is slowly permeable. During wet periods these soils are saturated within 20 inches of the surface for periods of several days."
