  "OVERVIEW": "The Sebree series consists of moderately deep over a duripan, well\ndrained soils on terraces or alluvial plains.  They formed in loess\nover unconsolidated alluvial sediments.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes\nare 0 to 12 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10\ninches and the average annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
