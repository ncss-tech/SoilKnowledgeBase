  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Content of mica flakes is few to common.  Content of rock fragments, mainly channers or flagstones, ranges up to 35 percent within 40 inches of the surface, and up to 60 percent below.  Unless limed, the soil is extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 o 3.  It is fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It has the same texture range as the Bw horizon.\nThe C horizon is similar in color to the Bw horizon or is multicolored.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cheoah, Plott, and Tuckasegee series.  Cheoah soils formed mainly in residuum, have C horizons of saprolite instead of colluvium, and are 40 to 60 inches to soft bedrock.  Plott and Tuckasegee soils formed in materials weathered from felsic to mafic high-grade metamorphic rock, contain fragments fo those rocks, and are very deep."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Santeetlah soils are on gently sloping to very steep benches, fans, drainageways, and foot slopes in the Southern Appalachian Mountains.  Elevation ranges from about 2,000 to 4,800 feet.   Slopes are commonly 20 to 50 percent, but range from 2 to 95 percent.  Santeetlah soils formed in colluvium derived from materials weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks such as phyllite, metasandstone, slate, and quartzite.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 70 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Cheoah soils, and the Brasstown, Cataska, Junaluska, Soco, Spivey, Stecoah, Sylco, and Tsali soils.  All of these soils except Spivey are on ridges and side slopes.  Spivey soils are in coves.  Brasstown, Junaluska, and Tsali soils have an argillic horizon.  Cataska,  Spivey, and Sylco soils are loamy-skeletal.  Soco and Stecoah soils have an ochric epipedon."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of this soil is in forest.  Common trees are yellow poplar, black cherry, black birch, sugar maple, northern red oak, black oak, white oak, eastern hemlock, and yellow buckeye. At elevations above 4,000 feet yellow birch and northern red oak are also common.  Common understory plants include rhododendron, mountain laurel, American chestnut sprouts, blueberry, striped maple, red maple, serviceberry, silverbell, flame azalea, trillium, hay-scented fern, Solomon's seal, yellow mandarin, woodfern, and New York fern.  Also, some areas of Santeetlah soils are used for high value crops such as burley tobacco, tomatoes, Christmas trees, and ornamentals, and for hay and pasture."
