Texture is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam. Some pedons have B't horizons with similar colors and textures as the Btx horizon.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8 with redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, gray and red that range from common to many; or there is no dominant color and it is multicolored in shades of yellow, brown, gray and red.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Barger, Cane, Kizzia, Ora and Wax series.  Barger soils formed on upland ridge tops in material with a high chert content, have a discontinuity within the solum, and are in MLRAs 118 (Arkansas Ridge and Valley), 125 (Cumberland Plateau and Mountains), 128 (Southern Appalachian Ridge and Valley) and 129 (Sand Mountain). Cane soils have redder subsoils that weathered on uplands from sandstone, shale or limestone, and are in MLRAs 118, and 129. Kizzia soils have redder subsoils and are on interfluves of Cretaceous Western Coastal Plain of Arkansas and possibly Oklahoma. Ora soils are on similar positions but have redder subsoils. Wax soils formed from cherty limestone in MLRA 128."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Savannah soils are on nearly level to gently sloping loamy marine and fluvial terraces and uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain. The climate is humid subtropical. Slopes of 1 to 8 percent are dominant but can range up to 15 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 68 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 58 inches."

The well-drained Cahaba soils are on lower terrace positions, have redder subsoils and do not have a fragipan. The poorly drained Mashulaville and Myatt soils are on broad flats and depressions of uplands and terraces. The well-drained McLaurin, Ruston and Smithdale soils are on higher positions, have redder subsoils and do not have a fragipan. In addition, McLaurin soils have coarse-loamy control sections. Paden soils are on similar positions, have a bisequum and contain more silt throughout the solum. The somewhat poorly drained Pheba and Stough soils are on similar positions.  In addition, Stough soils have coarse-loamy control sections. Prentiss soils are on similar positions but have coarse-loamy control sections. The somewhat poorly drained Quitman soils are on lower stream terraces and do not have developed fragipans."
