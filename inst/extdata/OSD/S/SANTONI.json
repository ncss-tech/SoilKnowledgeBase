  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the gley colors ranges from 10 to 16 inches, and to the water table from 20 to 36 inches.  Texture of the soil is clay throughout.  Consistency when wet is always sticky and plastic.  Effervescence with dilute HCL varies from strong to slight and decreases with depth.\nColors of the A horizons are in hues of 2.5Y and 10YR, values of 3 and chromas of 1 and 2.\nColors of the B and C horizons have dominantly low chromas and yellowish to bluish hues.  Pressure faces vary from common to many.  Cracks can be seen in these soils during dry season and the COLE value for the upper 30 inches is more than 0.09."

The Bajura soils are not calcareous.  The Perchas and Maunabo soils are more acid throughout their profiles.  The Vayas and Fortuna soils do not have clays with shrink and swell behavior.  The Playa soils are underlaid by sandy sediments within the control section.  The Josefa, Talante and Corcega soils have coarser textured profiles and are better drained.  The Coloso soils are not calcareous and have brighter colors in the upper profile.  The Pinones soils are underlaid by organic horizons within 40 inches of the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Santoni soils occur on nearly level river flood plains on slope gradients between 0 and 2 percent.  These flood plains are associated with overlying limestone hills which recharge the soil with carbonates.  The regolith consists of fine textured sediments derived from limestone and volcanic hills.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation is 84 inches and the mean annual temperature is 78 degrees F.  Average yearly soil temperature at 20 inches depth is over 71.6 degrees F and the difference between mean summer and winter temperatures is less than 9 degrees F."
