  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sigbird series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium and residuum derived from hard shale, sandstone, siltstone or argillite.  These soils are on escarpments, ridges and sideslopes of mountains. Slopes are 25 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
