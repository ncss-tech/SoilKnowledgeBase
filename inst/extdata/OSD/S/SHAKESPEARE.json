The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 12 to 15 degrees C.\nRock fragments: range from 25 to 75 percent in any one horizon and average 35 to 50 percent in the 25 to 75 centimeters section. They range from gravel to boulders but are predominantly gravel and cobbles.\nThe A1 horizon:\nHue: 10YR or 2.5Y\nValue: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist\nChroma: 2 or 3\nTexture of the fine earth fraction: Sandy loam, loam and silt loam\nReaction: Strongly to slightly acid.\nThe A2 horizon:\nHue: 10YR or 2.5Y\nValue: 6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist\nChroma: 2 or 3 moist or dry\nTexture of the fine earth fraction: Sandy loam, loam and silt loam\nReaction: Strongly to slightly acid\nOther features: Mottles with hue of 5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 6 to 8 occur in some pedons.
