Sogn was sampled in two other areas within MLRA 76 and sent to KSSL for lab analysis. All the lab data came back Clayey. Changed classification from Loamy to Clayey. Updated intro to current standards. Updated slope range and converted precipitation from centimeters to millimeters. Updated typical pedon description. Added quadrangle, latitude, longitude, and datum to type location. Added A2 horizon description. Changed particle size class to Fine. Updated particle size control section clay and sand content. Added textures silty clay, gravelly silty clay loam, gravely silty clay, channery silty clay loam, channery silty clay, very channery silty clay loam, and very channery silty clay. Removed soils listed as competing series. Updated geographically associated soils by adding Kipson and deleting Apache and Venezia. Added precipitation pattern and elevation to geographic setting. Added LRRs and MLRAs to distribution and extent. Changed MO responsible to Salina, KS. Added lab data to additional data.\nAdditional data: Kansas State University Pedology Laboratory data is available for Pedon ID 1988KS061063. Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory data is available for Pedon IDs S2014KS015500, S2014KS061500, and S2014KS149500.\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
