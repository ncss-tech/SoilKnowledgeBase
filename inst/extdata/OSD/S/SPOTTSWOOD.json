  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon and depth to carbonate ranges from 16 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to sandy or sandy-skeletal material ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or less.  It commonly is loam and less commonly clay loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw and 2Bw horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  They are clay loam, loam or sandy loam averaging between 18 and 30 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. They are neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have few or common redoximorphic features in the lower part of the Bw horizon.  Some pedons do not have a 2Bw horizon.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Redoximorphic features are distinct or prominent.  It is sandy loam or loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a Bk horizon that is loam or clay loam or a 2Bk horizon that is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  If present, Bk or 2Bk horizons have common or many accumulations of carbonate.\nThe 2C or 3C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sand, loamy sand, or their gravely, very gravely, or extremely gravely analogues.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Thin strata of finer textures are in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Spottswood soils are on glacial outwash plains and stream terraces.  Surfaces are plane or slightly concave.  Slope gradients are 3 percent or less.  The soil formed in loamy alluvium over stratified sand and gravel.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 34 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 14 to 24 inches, most of which falls during spring and summer.  Growing season is about 105 to 155 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 13 to 18 inches; and growing degree days are about 2700 to 3300."

Divide and Marysland soils are in slightly lower positions on the landscape and have a calcic horizon within depths of 16 inches.  Fordtown, Fordville, Renshaw, and Renwash soils are on slightly higher positions on the landscape.  Fordtown and Fordville soils do not have redoximorphic features within 40 inches.  Renshaw and Renwash soils have sand and gravel at depths of less than 20 inches.  Sioux soils are on ridges and sharp slope breaks and have sand and gravel at depths of less than 14 inches."
