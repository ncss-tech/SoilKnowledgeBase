    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact, thickness of the solum and the depths of volcanic ash influence is 24 to 40 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts for 60 to 75 consecutive days within the four months that follow the summer solstice in 6 or more years out of 10.  Average rock fragment content in the particle-size control section is 15 to 35 percent which includes 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Individual horizons are up to 50 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry. Reaction is very strongly acid through moderately acid.  Some pedons have an E horizon.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It is gravelly loam or gravelly silt loam.  Reaction is strongly acid through slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a C horizon.\nThe 2Cd horizon has value of 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist, 2 through 6 dry.  It is dense glacial till that crushes to very gravelly silt loam, very gravelly loam, gravelly loam, or very gravelly sandy loam.  Consistence is hard or very hard dry and firm or very firm moist.  Reaction is strongly acid through slightly acid."

All of the competing series except Nati and Sadie soils lack a paralithic contact  within depths of 40 inches.  Nati soils are 20 to 55 percent weathered sandstone in the particle-size control section and have a paralithic contact with sandstone at 20 to 40 inches.  Sadie soils have an A1 horizon 4 to 8 inches thick and are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 days."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in noncompacted glacial till mixed with loess and volcanic ash over dense glacial till.  Sehome soils have a marine climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Snow cover is intermittent.  Average annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches.   Mean January temperature is about 36 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 63 degrees F.; and mean annual temperature is about 46 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 140 to 180 days."

This draft reflects a change in classification from coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Haplorthods to medial mesic Typic Vitrixerands.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 2 inches, a cambic horizon from 2 to 26 inches, and a paralithic contact with dense glacial till at 26 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
