  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils historically have been classified as Entisols based largely on landform position. The typical pedon is described with properties that are typical of cambic horizons. The presence of a cambic horizon would place these soils in the Oxyaquic Eutrudepts classification.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (Ap horizon).\nAquic conditions: redox features in all horizons below a depth of 63 cm.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for this soil is available through The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory, pedon CT-88.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
