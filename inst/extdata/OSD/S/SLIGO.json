The typical pedon is described with properties that are typical of cambic horizons. The presence of a cambic horizon would place these soils in the Oxyaquic Eutrudepts classification.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (Ap horizon).\nAquic conditions: redox features in all horizons below a depth of 63 cm."
