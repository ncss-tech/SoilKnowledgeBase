  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to soft bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Fragments of sandstone and siltstone range from 0 to 15 percent throughout.  The soil is very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout, except where lime has been added.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loamy sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe E and EB horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or l0YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loamy sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value or 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles of brown or yellow are in the lower part of the Bt horizon in some pedons.  Texture of the Bt horizon is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  In some pedons, the lower part of the Bt horizon may have 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments.\nThe Cr horizon consists of level-bedded or cross-bedded weathered sandstone or interbedded sandstone, siltstone, or shale.  It is rippable with heavy equipment and can be cut with hand tools in most places."

Apison soils have a higher content of silt in the argillic horizon than Sunlight soils.  The Cahaba, Durham, Emporia, Euharlee, Granville, Kempsville, Nauvoo,  Olla, Smithdale, Spadra, Stringtown, Suffolk and Vaucluse soils do not have a paralithic contact within a depth of 20 to 40 inches of the surface.  Pirum soils have an irregular lower boundary over tilted, fractured sandstone. Hartsells, Linker and Oktaha soils have hard sandstone bedrock within 40 inches of the soil surface."

The soil formed in loamy residuum weathered from sandstone interbedded with siltstone or shale.  Average annual temperature ranges from 58 to 63 degrees F. and average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches."

Albertville and Townley soils are on similar landforms and have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Bankhead soils are on adjacent side slopes and have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section .  Sunlight soils are on adjacent side slopes and are shallow to bedrock.  The Tidings soils are on adjacent side slopes and have 40 to 60 percent silt in the particle-size control section."
