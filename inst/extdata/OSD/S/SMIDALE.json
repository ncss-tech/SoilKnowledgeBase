  "OVERVIEW": "The Smidale series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from shale with some loess influence.  Smidale soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 20 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Beehunt soils are dominated by cobbles and have mollic epipedons less than 50 inches thick.  Burgi soils are calcareous beginning at about 40 inches.  Chambeam soils have mollic epipedons 20 to 40 inches thick, C horizons, and bedrock at 40 to 60 inches.  Climine soils have mollic epipedons 20 to 30 inches thick and subhorizons with durinodes in a friable matrix or silica coats and pendants on rock fragments.  Sinker and Westbutte soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Ginser soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Glean soils have a particle-size control section with 8 to 18 percent clay.  Lambring soils have a mollic epipedon 20 to 40 inches thick and do not have B horizons.  Rondowa soils have mollic epipedons 20 to 30 inches thick, are influenced by volcanic ash in the upper part of the profile, and do not have B horizons.  Shorthike soils have mollic epipedons less than 50 inches thick, have 10 to 15 percent clay, and are dominated by gravel in the particle-size control section.  St. Anthony soils are moderately deep to coarse sand and gravel.  Webfoot soils average 5 to 15 percent clay in the particle-size control section, are somewhat poorly drained, and have a saturated layer above 40 inches for 90 or more consecutive days.  Willynat soils have 5 to 15 percent clay in the particle-size control section."
