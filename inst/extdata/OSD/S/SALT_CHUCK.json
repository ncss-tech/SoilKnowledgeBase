  "OVERVIEW": "The Salt Chuck series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sandy beach sediments.  Salt Chuck soils occur on uplifted beach terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 115 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Most pedons have a mat, 10 to 14 inches thick, of organic materials composed of forest litter of needles, leaves and mosses in various stages of decomposition.  Base saturation of the surface mineral horizons is less than 50 percent (NH4OAC). Gravel content ranges from 70 to 80 percent in the control section. The mean annual soil temperature is about 44 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is about 47 degrees F.\nThe A horizon hue ranges from 5YR to 10YR.  Value moist is 2 or 3, and the chroma moist is 1 or 2.  Texture is loam, silt loam or sandy loam, modified by a large volume of pebbles and some sea shells.  This horizon is extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nThe upper part of the 2C horizon ranges from extremely gravelly sandy loam to extremely gravelly coarse sand.  Lenses of organic matter occur in some pedons.  This horizon is strongly acid or medium acid.\nThe lower part of the 2C horizon has  hue from 10YR through 5Y, a value moist of 3 or 4, and a chroma moist from 2 to 4.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 70 to 80 percent.  Sea shells are often present.  The fine earth fraction is dominantly coarse sand.  This horizon ranges from strongly acid to neutral."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Salt Chuck soils occur adjacent to the sea on low, nearly level to sloping uplifted beaches.  The material in which the soil formed is predominantly beach gravel from mixed rocksources.  The cli ate is humid maritime with mean annual precipitation in excess of 100 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F, and the mean summer air temperature is about 55 degrees F. The slope gradient ranges from 0 to 12 percent.  Elevations range from sea level to 100 feet."

The Salt Chuck series is proposed as a benchmark soil series."
