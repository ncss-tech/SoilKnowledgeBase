    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

Weighted average clay content of the particle size control section ranges from 18 to 25 percent, with more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. Buried A horizons are in the control section of most pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.  Horizons with mollic colors are less than 9 inches thick.\nThe Bw or Bwb horizon has matrix colors with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, gray, yellow, or red range from few to many.  Some subhorizons have value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 without redoximorphic features.  Aquic soil conditions, including matrix colors with chroma of 2 or less, and redoximorphic features are below a depth of 40 inches.  Texture of the subhorizons is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.  Most pedons contain subhorizons with two or more of these textures.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.  Typically, the matrix is noneffervescent.\nBuried A horizons with moist colors in hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3 range from 2 to about 12 inches thick.  Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral."

Bunyan soils are well drained and do not have a cambic horizon.   Manco soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a fine-silty control section.  Oletha soils have aquic soil conditions at a depth of 20 to 40 inches and have a clayey surface layer.  Thenas and Uhland soils have a coarse-loamy control section.  Nahatche soils are somewhat poorly drained and have aquic soil conditions within 20 inches of the soil surface.  Weswood soils are calcareous throughout.  Whitesboro soils have a mollic epipedon."

Slopes are mainly less than 1 percent, but range up to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 40 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 64 to 69 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 245 to 280 days, and elevation ranges from 200 to 350 feet.  Thornthwaite PE indices range from 52 to 64."

A fluctuating water table is within a depth of 3.5 to 6.0 feet during the winter and early spring months.  It is present for 1 to 3 cumulative months during most years.  Very brief or brief durations of flooding occurs at intervals ranging from one to five times a year during most years unless protected."
