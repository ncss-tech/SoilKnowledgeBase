  "OVERVIEW": "The Smithpond series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and eolian deposits derived from interbedded calcareous sedimentary rocks.  Smithpond soils are on fan remnants, alluvial fans, structural benches and mesas.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 8.5 degrees C.",
