  "STATES": "OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Slaughterville series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from loamy and sandy alluvial and eolian sediments, of Pleistocene age. These very gently sloping to steep soils occur on treads and risers of stream terraces, in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 1 to 45 percent. Mean annual temperature air is 16 degrees C (60 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 840 mm (33 in).",
