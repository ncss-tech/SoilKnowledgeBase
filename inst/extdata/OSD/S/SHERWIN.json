(Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described August 12, 1979 the profile was dry throughout.) The soil surface is partially covered with 40 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, and 1 percent stones.\nA1--0 to 8 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very cobbly ashy loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine interstitial pores; 30 percent pebbles, 20 percent cobbles, and 1 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the hard tuff is 4 to 14 inches.  The soil above the lithic contact is usually dry from about May 1 to November 15, and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the time.  The soil temperature is above 5 degrees C. from about April 1 to December 20, and is above 8 degrees C from about April 15 to November 30.  The mean annual soil temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C.  The soil surface has a 35 to 65 percent coverage of stones, cobbles and gravel, which are angular tuff fragments.  The gravel and cobbles predominate.  Surface stone coverage is 0 to 15 percent.  These soils contain 40 to 60 percent rhyolitic volcanic ash.  The soil is neutral or slightly alkaline.  The organic carbon content is 0.3 to 0.6 percent.  The clay content of the textural control section averages 6 to 10 percent.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3 or 8/2 and moist color of 10YR 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, or 6/2.  The upper part (A1) contains 35 to 55 percent angular tuff fragments consisting of 0 to 3 percent stones, 20 to 35 percent cobbles and 10 to 30 percent gravel.  The lower part (A2) is sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam or cobbly sandy loam.  It contains 10 to 20 percent angular tuff fragments, consisting of 0 to 3 percent stones, 5 to 15 percent cobbles, and 5 to 15 percent gravel."

Some of the fine-earth material is of mixed aeolian origin.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 300 mm, and the mean annual temperature is 7 to 12 degrees C.  The mean January temperature is about 1 degree C.; the mean July temperature is about 22 degrees C.  The frost-free season is 125 to 150 days."
