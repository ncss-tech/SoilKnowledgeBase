  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the loamy alluvium and depth to sandy or gravelly alluvium range from 24 to 40 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges form 7 to 16 inches.  The depth to carbonates ranges from 0 to 40 inches but is not continuous in all parts between 10 and 20 inches.  The textural family control section averages from 8 to 18 percent clay.  Volume of gravel makes up 0 to 15 percent of the loamy mantle and 0 to 35 percent of the lower sandy material.  The reaction of the upper material is moderately acid to slightly alkaline and the reaction of the lower material is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 3.  It is loam, silt loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have a muck surface layer up to 6 inches thick\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is typically stratified with textures of loam, silt loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  A BC or Cg horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Strata with lower value and/or lower chroma than the matrix are present in this horizon.  The texture is sand, fine sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand or their gravelly analogues.  Thin strata of finer textured material is typically present."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sedgeville soils are on plane, slightly concave or slightly concave slopes on flood plains.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in loamy alluvium overlying sandy alluvium.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 21 to 26 inches.  Frost free period ranges from 90 to 140 days.  Elevation ranges from 670 to 1950 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arvilla, Barnes, Buse, Nidaros, Oylen and Sandberg soils.  The Sandberg, Arvilla, and Oylen soils are on nearby terraces above the floodplain.  Barnes and Buse soils are on nearby glacial till areas.  Nidaros soils are in abandoned meander channels with organic deposits 16 to 51 inches thick."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained and very poorly drained.  Runoff is low.  Permeability is moderate in the upper loamy alluvium and rapid or very rapid in the lower sandy or gravelly alluvium.  Flooding is rare to frequent and very brief to long duration.   The main period of flooding is March to June, but flooding can occur following any period of high runoff.  Sedgeville soils have an apparent seasonal high water table from .5 to 1.5 feet from November to June on the poorly drained phase and +1.0 to .5 from January to December on the very poorly drained phase in most years."
