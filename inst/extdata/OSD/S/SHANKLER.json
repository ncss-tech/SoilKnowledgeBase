  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is greater than 80 inches. Thickness of the A horizons ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Base saturation at 72 inches ranges from 8 to 25 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 and 3. Where value is 3, the horizon is less than 6 inches thick. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 3 and 4. Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. Brownish and reddish mottles range from none to common. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam. The average clay content in the upper 20 inches ranges from 18 to 35 percent. The Bt horizons are strongly acid or very strongly acid. Plinthite in the Bt horizons ranges from 0 to about 4 percent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These include the Albany, Blanton, Darco, Tehran, and Troup series in the same family and the similar Alaga, Betis, Boykin, Briley, Darden, Gunter, Kenney, Letney, and Tonkawa series. Alaga, Darden, and Tonkawa soils lack Bt horizons within\n80 inches and are sandy throughout. Albany and Blanton soils have mottles with chroma of 2 or less in the lower A or upper Bt horizons. In addition, Blanton soils have A horizon with more than 50 percent of the uncoated sand grains. Betis soils have Bt horizon consisting of lamella or Bt horizons of loamy fine sand. Boykin, Briley, and Letney soils have sandy A horizons 20 to 40 inches thick. Darco soils have base saturation that is greater than 15 percent, summer soil moisture deficit of 4 to 6 inches, and summer rainfall of 25 to 30 inches; and Darco soils also are assumed to have other chemical or morphological differences or both. Gunter soils contain more than 5 percent plinthite in the Bt horizon. Kenney soils have more than 35 percent base saturation. Tehran soils have a higher percent of medium and coarse sand. Troup soils contain less silt, have low activity clays in the argillic horizon and typically have a slightly lower base saturation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Shankler soils are on gently sloping to steep uplands of the Western Coastal Plain. Slope gradients are dominantly 8 to 20 percent, but range from 1 to 25 percent. The soils formed in sandy and loamy sediments of Pleistocene Age, mainly of the Willis formation. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 46 to 58 inches. Summer rainfall ranges from 30 to 40 inches. Summer moisture deficit ranges from 0 to 4 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 66 degrees to 70 degrees F., and\nthe Thornthwaite annual P-E indices exceed 72."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Boykin series and the Bonwier, Doucette, and Newco series. Boykin, Doucette, and Newco soils are on similar positions. Bonwier soils are slightly higher in the landscape. Bonwier and Newco soils have more clayey subsoils. Doucette soils have sandy A horizons 20 to 40 inches thick, and contain plinthite."
