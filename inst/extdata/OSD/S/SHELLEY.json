  "OVERVIEW": "The Shelley series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively to excessively drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium.  The Shelley soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",
