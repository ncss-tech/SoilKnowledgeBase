  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Sycoline series are moderately deep and moderately well to somewhat poorly drained.  They formed from residuum of granulite and hornfel rock materials of Triassic and Jurassic age.  These soils are on upland sideslopes in the Culpeper Basin of the northern part of the Piedmont.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 41 inches.",

The substratum is saprolite from hornfel and granulite.  Rock fragments of granulite and hornfel range from 0 to 35 percent in the solum.   Rock fragments of granulite and hornfel range from 0 to 70 percent in the substratum. The fine earth fraction has more than 50 percent silt plus very fine sand.  The soil is very strongly acid through moderately acid throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of l0YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is a silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of l0YR through 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 through 8.  It is a silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 8.  It is a silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon is saprolite that weathers from granulite and hornfel and is multicolored in shades of brown, yellow and gray.  It is loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction."
