    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 15 to 30 inches. Depth to hard bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Some pedons have a paralithic contact over the hard bedrock.  The substratum is saprolite from hornfel and granulite.  Rock fragments of granulite and hornfel range from 0 to 35 percent in the solum.   Rock fragments of granulite and hornfel range from 0 to 70 percent in the substratum. The fine earth fraction has more than 50 percent silt plus very fine sand.  The soil is very strongly acid through moderately acid throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of l0YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is a silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of l0YR through 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 through 8.  It is a silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 8.  It is a silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon is saprolite that weathers from granulite and hornfel and is multicolored in shades of brown, yellow and gray.  It is loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction."
