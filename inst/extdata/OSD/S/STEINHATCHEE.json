  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to limestone bedrock ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the A, E, Bh, and Bw horizons, and from moderately acid to neutral in the Btg horizon.  Depth to the argillic horizon ranges from 20 to 36 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features and vertical streaks in dark shades of gray or brown range from none to common.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 4 or less; or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown and intrusions of material that is similar in color and texture to the E horizon range from none to common.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown, or yellow range from few to many.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown, yellow, or red range from few to common.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam with 50 percent or more fine or coarser sand.  About 3 percent, by volume, limestone pebbles or cobbles are present in the lower part in some pedons.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 8, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is composed of soft, weathered, fractured limestone that can be dug with difficulty with a spade, has very firm to extremely firm rupture resistance with low to high excavation difficulty.  It usually contains soft carbonate accumulations along with few to many hard limestone or chert fragments.  It is highly irregular and interspersed with solution holes that range from 4 to 12 inches in diameter and filled with sandy loam to sandy clay textured soil material.  Depth to limestone is variable within short distances.\nThe 2R horizon is composed of hard, unweathered limestone that has slightly rigid to very rigid rupture resistance with very high to extremely excavation difficulty.  Some areas contain solution holes filled with Btg and/or Cr material."

Goldhead, Meadowbrook, and Tooles soils do not have spodic horizons.  In addition, Goldhead and Meadowbrook soils are very deep to limestone, Meadowbrook soils do not have argillic horizons within a depth of 40 inches, and Tooles soils are deep to limestone.  Leon, Pottsburg, and Wesconnet soils do not have argillic horizons and are very deep to limestone.  In addition, Wesconnet soils are very poorly drained.  Tennille and Wekiva soils are shallow to limestone bedrock and do not have spodic horizons."

Natural vegetation consists mainly of slash, longleaf or loblolly pine, and scattered sweetgum and water oaks.  The understory vegetation is dominated by sawpalmetto, gallberry, fetterbush, waxmyrtle, scattered cabbage palms, pineland threeawn, cinnamon fern, bluestems, and panicums."

The water table is at a depth of 6 to 18 inches for 1 to 3 months during most years, and between depths of 18 and 60 inches during most of the rest of the time.  It is within a depth of 6 inches for short periods following heavy rains.\nMLRA:  152A.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
