    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Some pedons lack the 2C horizon.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid except for limed surface layers.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Mottles in shades of yellow or brown are in some pedons.  The A horizon is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe BA or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 through 8, with few to common iron depletions in shades of gray and few to common iron accumulations in shades of brown.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 8, with few to many iron depletions of chroma 2 or less.  In some pedons there are few to common iron accumulations in shades of yellow and brown.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Clay content of the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon ranges from 18 to 35 percent and silt plus clay exceeds 50 percent.\nThe Btg horizon occurs at depths of 20 inches and below.  It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, or neutral, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  They are common to many iron accumulations.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe BCg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, or neutral, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, or neutral, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is stratified sand, gravel, loamy sand, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, or neutral, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Chapanoke soils that formed in alluvial sediments derived from coastal plain sediments.  Competing series in related families include the Amy, Augusta, Lynchburg, Nahunta, Summerfield, and Yemassee series.  Amy soils are dominated by gray colors just beneath the A or Ap horizon.  Augusta, Lynchburg, Summerfield, and Yemassee soils have more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon.  In addition, Summerfield soils have clayey lower B horizons.  Nahunta soils have solum thickness of greater than 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sylacauga soils occur on nearly level, low stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The regolith is stratified silty and loamy fluvial sediments derived dominantly from weathered Talladega slate but also consisting of sediments from limestone, cherty limestone, quartzite, shale, sandstone, and mudstone and argillite from the Carolina Slate Belt.  Near the type location, average annual rainfall is 53 inches and average annual air temperature is 62 degrees F."

Chenneby and Chewacla soils lack argillic horizons.  Chocolocco, Masada, McQueen, Shellbluff, and Wickham soils are well drained.  Moncure soils are poorly drained and intermingled in some areas in depressions and lower positions of the terrace."
