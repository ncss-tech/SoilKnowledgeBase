Badena soils are dominated mainly by cobbles in the particle-size control section and have C horizons with sandy texture.  Badenaugh soils are moderately acid or slightly acid in lower part of the argillic horizon and have mainly cobbles throughout their profile.  Eaglerock, Gitabyte, Grinrod, Ister, Searles, Searvar, and Trid soils have bedrock within 100 cm of the soil surface.  Lemm soils have 15 to 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Leviathan soils have a solum more than 100 cm thick.  Nosrac soils have a solum more than 125 cm thick.  Oest soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Shawmount soils have horizons with lamellae below the argillic horizon.  Shroe soils have an argillic horizon with 35 to 45 percent clay and prismatic structure. Tollgate soils are an inactive series. Tristan soils have dominantly cobbles and stones in the argillic horizon and bedrock at 100 to 150 cm."
