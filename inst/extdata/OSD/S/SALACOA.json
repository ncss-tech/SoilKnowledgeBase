  "OVERVIEW": "The Salacoa series consists of very deep, well drained soils on uplands. These soils formed in colluvium and the underlying residuum from interbedded sandstone, siltstone and shale. They are on benches, foot slopes and lower portions of side slopes and back slopes. Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.",

Poindexter soils are moderately deep and formed in residuum from basic and/or acidic rocks in the Piedmont Uplands.  Teksob soils formed in loamy alluvium on terraces in the Western Lowlands of Arkansas and the lower Mississippi River Valley."
