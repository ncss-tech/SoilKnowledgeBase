    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Karma, Mocksville, Poindexter and Teksob series.  The Karma soils formed in loamy alluvium from mafic and crystalline parent material and are on terraces in the Western Coastal Plain and Arkansas Valley and Ridges.  Mocksville soils formed in residuum weathered from mafic and crystalline parent material in the Piedmont Uplands.  Poindexter soils are moderately deep and formed in residuum from basic and/or acidic rocks in the Piedmont Uplands.  Teksob soils formed in loamy alluvium on terraces in the Western Lowlands of Arkansas and the lower Mississippi River Valley."
