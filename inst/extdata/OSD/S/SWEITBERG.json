  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum thickness and depth to a lithic contact with basalt is 20 to 40 inches. Average annual soil temperature is about 46 degrees F. The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days during summer and fall. The particle-size control section has 35 to 50 percent clay. The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon or the entire argillic horizon if less than 20 inches thick averages 10 to 35 percent rock fragments. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick and includes the upper part of the argillic horizon. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A or Ap horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.\nAn AB horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe Bt and 2Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 through 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. The Bt silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay with 35 to 55 percent clay. The 2Bt horizon is very cobbly clay, very gravelly clay or gravelly silty clay with 40 to 55 percent clay."

Arva, Broadhead, Henefer, Highwood, Rugar, and Schnipps soils are more than 40 inches deep. Bumpheads soils are 24 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact.  Cristo soils have a calcareous C horizon that is 55 to 95 percent rock fragments above the lithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sweitberg soils are on basalt plateaus or structural benches.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. These soils formed in loess over slope alluvium and colluvium from weathered basalt. Elevation ranges from 3,400 to 4,500 feet. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist. Average annual precipitation is typically 20 to 25 inches but ranges to 17 inches in northeastern Oregon. Average annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. Frost-free season is 70 to 115 days."
