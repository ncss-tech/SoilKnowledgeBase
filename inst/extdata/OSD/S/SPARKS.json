  "OVERVIEW": "The Sparks series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy eolian sediments in the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on upland plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 406 mm (16 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 15.6 C (60 degrees F).",
