  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Silverash soils are on depressions on plateaus and lakebeds. These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks and volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevation ranges from 1,310 to 1,580 meters. The climate is characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chancelakes, Embal, Overallflat and Raztack soils. Chancelakes soils have cracks more than 1 cm wide that are open during summer and fall and have argillic horizons that are more than 100 cm thick. Embal soils do not have argillic horizons and have ashy textures and glassy mineralogy throughout. Overallflat soils are in a slightly higher position on the landscape and have an aridic soil moisture regime. Raztack soils do not have aquic conditions in the upper part and have duripans below 100 cm."

Episaturation is present with perched free water between the soil surface and 20 cm (very shallow free water occurrence class) from January through July. Cumulative annual duration classes are Transitory or Common. These soils are susceptible to frequent ponding for long duration at some time between November through May with water depths of 0.3 to 30 cm."
