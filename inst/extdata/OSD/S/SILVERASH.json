  "OVERVIEW": "The Silverash series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks and volcanic ash. Silverash soils are on depressions on plateaus and lakebeds. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

Chancelakes soils have cracks more than 1 cm wide that are open during summer and fall and have argillic horizons that are more than 100 cm thick. Embal soils do not have argillic horizons and have ashy textures and glassy mineralogy throughout. Overallflat soils are in a slightly higher position on the landscape and have an aridic soil moisture regime. Raztack soils do not have aquic conditions in the upper part and have duripans below 100 cm."
