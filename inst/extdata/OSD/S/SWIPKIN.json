  "OVERVIEW": "The Swipkin series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial lake sediments with a component of loess and volcanic ash. These soils are on lake plains, terraces, and terrace escarpment. Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 to 49 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 17 inches thick.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.20 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.   The particle-size control section is 10 to 18 percent clay, and less than 15 percent material coarser than very fine sand, including 0 to 5 percent pebbles.  Base saturation (by sum of cations) is assumed to be less than 75 percent in some or all parts of the upper 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  When moist value is 3, moist chroma is 4.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam and is 0 to 5 percent pebbles.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam and is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline above a depth of 44 inches, and neutral to moderately alkaline below this depth.  Some pedons are calcareous and contain secondary carbonates below a depth of 44 inches."
