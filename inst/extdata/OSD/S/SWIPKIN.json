  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 to 49 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 17 inches thick.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.20 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.   The particle-size control section is 10 to 18 percent clay, and less than 15 percent material coarser than very fine sand, including 0 to 5 percent pebbles.  Base saturation (by sum of cations) is assumed to be less than 75 percent in some or all parts of the upper 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  When moist value is 3, moist chroma is 4.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam and is 0 to 5 percent pebbles.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam and is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline above a depth of 44 inches, and neutral to moderately alkaline below this depth.  Some pedons are calcareous and contain secondary carbonates below a depth of 44 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Swipkin soils are on lake plains, terraces, and terrace escarpments.  These soils formed in glacial lake sediments with a component of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Elevations range from 1,450 to 2,800 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches.  The mean January temperatures is about 24 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 67 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.   The frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."

Bisbee soils are sandy throughout the profile.  Cedonia soils are fine-silty and have an ochric epipedon.  Donavan and Hudnut soils are coarse-loamy.  Omak soils are fine and have a duripan at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."
