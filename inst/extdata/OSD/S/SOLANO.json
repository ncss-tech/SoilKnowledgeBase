  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 60 degrees to 65 degrees F. The soil between the depths of about 4 and 12 inches is usually dry in all parts by some time in May and remains dry until some time in October. Some or all of this part of the profile is moist all the rest of the time. The A horizon is light gray or light brownish gray in 10YR hue and has yellowish brown mottles in some pedons. It is loam or silt loam and is very strongly to medium acid. The B horizon is brown, pale brown, yellowish brown, or light yellowish brown. It has medium or strong columnar structure in the upper part. The structure and appearance of the upper B horizon gives the impression of being clay texture, but laboratory data show the texture to be a clay loam. Exchangeable sodium percentage is 15 to 50 in all parts of the Bt horizon."

Orestimoa, Ortigalita, and Pond soils lack the columnar or prismatic structure of natric horizons and the Orestimba and Ortigalita soils have more than 35 percent clay. Waukena soils are neutral to strongly alkaline in the A horizons and calcareous in all parts of the B horizon."

The soils formed in mixed, moderately fine textured, sedimentary alluvium. The climate is mesothermal with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F., average January temperature is about 46 degrees F., and average July temperature about 76 degrees F. Frost- free season averages about 260 days."
