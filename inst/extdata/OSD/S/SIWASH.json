The silty solum ranges in thickness from 8 to 14 inches and maybe bisequal. The upper ten centimeters of the spodic horizon has more than 6 percent organic carbon. The upper part of the control section formed in loess dominated by amorphous material. Horizon topography in the upper part is irregular or broken due to cryoturbation. Reaction throughout the profile ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon (when present) has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe E and Eb horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam and loam.\nThe Bs/Eb horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 4 to 8. The Eb portion has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam, fine sandy loam and sandy loam.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is loam or sandy loam, modified by 35 to 50 percent coarse fragments; 30 to 45 percent gravel, and 5 to 25 percent cobbles."

Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent. The soils formed in loess, mixed with ash, overlying friable to firm glacial till and underlain by igneous or metamorphic bedrock. Mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 to 50 inches."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this profile include: albic horizons from 4 to 5 inches and intermittently from 9 to 13 inches; spodic horizon from 5 to 15 inches; more than 6 percent organic carbon in the upper 4 inches of the spodic; amorphous material dominant from 4 to 15 inches; consolidated bedrock at 17 inches below the mineral surface.\nThis soil was originally defined as shallow to bedrock; the O horizon was 4 to 0 inches, and bedrock at 17 inches. When soil depth was defined as starting at the top of O horizons (when present) that changed the depth of the soil to moderately deep. This changes the description class but not the Taxonomic Class. Eight Edition of Soil Taxonomy defines Lithic subgroups in this classification starting from the top of the mineral soil surface (page 708).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
