Crawley soils have less than 15 percent gravel. Luppino soils have mollic epipedons that do not include any part of the argillic horizon and also have hard bedrock within 76 cm. Nomisurvey and Wedekind soils have 20 to 27 percent clay in the Bt horizon and the rock fragments are not dominated by 2 to 5 mm sized gravel."
