  "OVERVIEW": "The Scalfar series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rocks with a component of loess.  Scalfar soils are on mountains, hills, and fan remnants.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
