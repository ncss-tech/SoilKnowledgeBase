The difference between the mean summer and winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F. These soils are usually moist and are dry 0 to 30 consecutive days in the summer; udic soil moisture regime. Depth to bedrock is over 60 inches. The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to bedrock contact has andic soil properties with 35 to 85 percent rock fragments by volume. The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.30 to 0.70 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 5 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, 15-bar water retention of 25 to 50 percent for air-dried samples and acid oxalate iron of 1.0 to 2.5 percent. It has 2 to 8 cmol/kg of aluminum. The particle-size control section has 10 to 25 percent field estimated clay and 10 to 30 percent sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4.

The soils are in a mild marine climate and have cool, moist summers and cool, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 170 inches. The average January temperature is about 37 degrees F.; the average July temperature is about 58 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 41 to 45 degrees F. The frost free season is 120 to 140 days."
