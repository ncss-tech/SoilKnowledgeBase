  "OVERVIEW": "The Snahopish consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone and loess. These soils are on mountain sides and foot slopes. Slopes are 0 to 100 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The difference between the mean summer and winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F. These soils are usually moist and are dry 0 to 30 consecutive days in the summer; udic soil moisture regime. Depth to bedrock is over 60 inches. The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to bedrock contact has andic soil properties with 35 to 85 percent rock fragments by volume. The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.30 to 0.70 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 5 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, 15-bar water retention of 25 to 50 percent for air-dried samples and acid oxalate iron of 1.0 to 2.5 percent.
