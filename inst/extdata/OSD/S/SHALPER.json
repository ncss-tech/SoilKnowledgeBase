  "OVERVIEW": "The Shalper series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuffs, rhyolite and other igneous rocks.  The Shalper soils are on side slopes and crests or summits of hills and fan piedmonts with rock core.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
