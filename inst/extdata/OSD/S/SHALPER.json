  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in residuum derived from welded tuffs, rhyolite and other similar igneous rocks with some small areas of granitic rock.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,590 to 2,290 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
