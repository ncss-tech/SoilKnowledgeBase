  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 18 to 30 inches and generally corresponds to the depth to stratified sands and gravel.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Gravel content ranges from 5 to 40 percent by volume in the solum.  Rock fragments in the substratum range from 35 to 65 percent by volume and consist mostly of gravel and cobbles.  Rock fragments are mainly slate, shale, and phyllite with lesser amounts of gneiss, granite, and limestone.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum, unless limed, and from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the substratum.\nSome pedons have an Ap or A horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, and value and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It has weak or moderate very fine to medium granular structure.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe E horizon is neutral or has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It has weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular structure.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR with value and chroma of 3 or less.  Some pedons have a Bh horizon with hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 6.  The Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The B horizons are fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.  They have weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular or weak medium subangular blocky structure.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction, but the lower depth limit of sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction is 27 inches from the mineral soil surface.  It has weak fine granular structure or it is single grain.  Consistence is loose to friable.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, sand, or coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction, with strata of sands and gravel."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Brownstone(T), Colton, Grotto, Guardlake, Hermon, Marblemount, Masardis, Teneriffe, and Waiska series.  The Brownstone(T), Grotto, Guardlake,  Marblemount, Teneriffe, and Waiska series are from outside of Region R.  Brownstone and Marblemount soils have a lithic or paralithic contact within 20 to 40 inches of the soil surface.  Colton and Masardis soils have loamy caps less than 18 inches thick.  Grotto soils have an ustic moisture regime.  Guardlake soils have a thinner solum and have free carbonates within 60 inches.  Hermon soils do not have stratification in the lower part of the series control section.  Teneriffe soils formed in volcanic ash and do not have stratification in the substratum.  Waiska soils have red and white sandstone rock fragments and have thinner loamy surface layers."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stetson soils are on glacial outwash plains, terraces, kames and eskers.  Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in sand and gravel derived mainly from slate, shale and phyllite, with lesser amounts of gneiss, granite and limestone.  The climate is humid and cool temperate.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 46 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 46 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 140 days.  Elevation ranges from 5 to 2000 feet above mean sea level."

The excessively drained and somewhat excessively drained Adams soils, well drained Allagash soils, and somewhat excessively drained Masardis soils are in similar positions on the landscape.  Adams and Masardis soils have thinner loamy caps.  Allagash soils have finer textured loamy caps.  The moderately well drained Machias and Sheepscot soils and moderately well to somewhat poorly drained Madawaska soils are in lower positions on the landscape."
