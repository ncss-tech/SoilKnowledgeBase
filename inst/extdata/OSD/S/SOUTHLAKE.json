    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil between depths of 9 and 28 inches is dry from April 15th to November 30th.  It is usually moist in some part for about 85 days when the soil temperature is above 5 degrees C.  It is continuously moist in the moisture control section for about 50 days when the soil temperature is above 8 degrees C.  The moisture regime is aridic but it borders on xeric.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F.  The soil surface is covered with 25 to 35 percent rock fragments consisting of 0 to 2 percent boulders, 0 to 15 percent stones, 3 to 15 percent cobbles, and 10 to 30 percent gravel. Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3 or 5/4, and moist color of 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.  Textures are stony or gravelly sandy loam.  It contains 15 to 35 percent rock fragments consisting of 0 to 15 percent boulders and stones, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 10 to 30 percent gravel.  The organic matter content averages 0.5 to 1.0 percent for the surface 15 inches.  Clay content is 5 to 15 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/4; 7.5YR 4/6, 5/6, 5/4 or 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/4; 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6 or 5/4.  Textures of the B horizon are very stony or very gravelly sandy clay loam, sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  The horizon contains 35 to 60 percent rock fragments consisting of 5 to 30 percent stones and boulders, 10 to 20 percent cobbles, and 10 to 35 percent gravel. Clay content is 18 to 35 in the upper part and as low as 10 percent in the lower part."
