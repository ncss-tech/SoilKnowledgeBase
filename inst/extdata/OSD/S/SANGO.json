  "OVERVIEW": "The Sango series consists of moderately well drained soils with a slowly permeable fragipan in the subsoil.  The soil formed in a silty mantle 40 to 70 inches thick and the underlying residuum weathered from limestone or old alluvium.  The soil is on upland flats and in depressions.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.",

Rock fragments, 1/4 to 3 inches in diameter, range from 0 to 3 percent in the A, E, Bw, and B/E horizons, from 0 to 10 percent in the Btx horizon, and from 0 to 50 percent in the 2Bt and 2C horizons.  Reaction in each horizon ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid, except where limed.\nThe A and Ap horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or rarely silt.\nThe E horizon and the E part of the B/E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is silt loam or rarely silt.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 5 or 6, and chromas of 3 to 6.  Some pedons have redoximorphic features with chromas of 2 or less in the lower few inches of the Bw horizon.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe B/E or E/B horizon has colors similar to the E and Bw horizons. Texture is silt loam or silt.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 4 to 6, and chromas of 4 or 6. Common to many redoximorphic features are in shades of gray, brown, olive, and yellow.  Some pedons are an evenly mottled pattern without a dominant matrix color.  Texture is  commonly silt loam throughout, but some pedons are silty clay loam in the lower part.\nThe 2Bt and 2C horizons have hue of 10YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Few to many redoximorphic features are in shades of brown, gray, and yellow.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay, and rarely clay loam."
