  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is more than 72 inches.  Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 40 to 70 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 18 to 30 inches.  Rock fragments, 1/4 to 3 inches in diameter, range from 0 to 3 percent in the A, E, Bw, and B/E horizons, from 0 to 10 percent in the Btx horizon, and from 0 to 50 percent in the 2Bt and 2C horizons.  Reaction in each horizon ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid, except where limed.\nThe A and Ap horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or rarely silt.\nThe E horizon and the E part of the B/E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is silt loam or rarely silt.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 5 or 6, and chromas of 3 to 6.  Some pedons have redoximorphic features with chromas of 2 or less in the lower few inches of the Bw horizon.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe B/E or E/B horizon has colors similar to the E and Bw horizons. Texture is silt loam or silt.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 4 to 6, and chromas of 4 or 6. Common to many redoximorphic features are in shades of gray, brown, olive, and yellow.  Some pedons are an evenly mottled pattern without a dominant matrix color.  Texture is  commonly silt loam throughout, but some pedons are silty clay loam in the lower part.\nThe 2Bt and 2C horizons have hue of 10YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Few to many redoximorphic features are in shades of brown, gray, and yellow.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay, and rarely clay loam."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Soils in closely related families are the Cane, Dickson, Lax, Locust, Ora, Prentiss, Savannah, Sano, and Taft series.  Each of these soils, except the Prentiss and Sano soils, have more than 18 percent clay in the control section between the base of the Ap horizon and the top of the fragipan.  In addition, Cane, Locust, Ora, Prentiss, and Savannah soils have more than 15 percent fine and coarser sand; Sano soils have the same classification except are mesic, and Taft soils have gray mottles in the upper 10 inches of the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sango soils are on upland flats and in depressions.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Some areas are ponded for short periods.  The soils formed in a silty mantle, presumably loess, ranging from 40 to 70 inches or more in thickness, underlain by residuum of limestone or old alluvium which contains more clay than the silty mantle.  Near the type location, mean annual temperature is 59.3 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 54.0 inches."
