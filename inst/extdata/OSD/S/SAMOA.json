Acquango soils are very slightly to moderately saline within the series control section. Aldo soils have a saturated zone between 1 and 2 meters for as much as 1 month per year in normal years. Bigapple soils have anthrotransported materials over 100 centimeters thick. Biltmore soils have flakes of mica throughout. Boplain soils have a paralithic contact within the series control section. Breeze soils contain more than 10 percent (by volume) construction debris. Caesar, Oakville, Osolo, Penwood, Poquonock, and Spessard, and Windsor soils have Bw horizons with chromas greater than 3. Chute, Sardak, and Sarpy soils contain free carbonates. Dabney, Perks, and Suncook soils are formed in sandy alluvium. Hodge soils contain more than 40 percent silt plus clay plus very fine sand in the particle-size control section. Pahuk soils have relict redoximorphic features in the lower third of the series control section. Pinegrove soils formed in acid regolith from surface mine operations. Plainfield, Scotah, and Tyner soils have Bw horizons with hues of 10YR and 7.5YR. Rikers soils contain an average of greater than 35 percent rock fragments of carboliths and coal slag. Wapanucket soils have a lithologic discontinuity within the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Samoa soils are on recently stablized dunes on dune fields and coastal plains. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. Elevations are 0 to 20 meters (0 to 65 feet). These soils formed in eolian and marine sand derived from mixed sources. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 890 to 2030 millimeters (35 to 80 inches). The mean annual temperature is 12 to 15 degrees C (54 to 59 degrees F). Frost free season is about 275 to 330 days."

Native vegetation includes American beachgrass, yarrow, beach strawberry, beach wormwood, Humboldt wallflower (endangered), beach tidytips, coastal sand verbena, goldenrod, beach suncups, camphor tansy, creamcups, beach-bur, European searocket, seaside buckwheat, silky beach pea, seaside fleabane, seashore false bindweed, pink sand verbena, California polypody, Brewers rush, coyote brush, and scattered shore pine. Many areas of the Samoa soil are dominated by non-native European beachgrass planted to stabilize dunes and prevent sand movement. Other non-native vegetation includes yellow bush lupine, iceplant, pampas grass, and other grasses and forbs."
