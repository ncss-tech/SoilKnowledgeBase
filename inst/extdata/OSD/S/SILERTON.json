    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum and depth to rock is 60 inches or more.  The soil is strongly acid to very strongly acid throughout except the surface layer is less acid where limed.  Transition horizons have characteristics similar to adjacent horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam or rarely loam.\nThe Ap horizon, where present, is 5 to 12 inches thick. It has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is silt loam or loam, and in severely eroded areas includes silty clay loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma 4 or 6.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Streaks and pockets of silt loam or loam with hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 range from none to common in the lower part of the Bt horizon.  In some pedons the lower part of the Bt horizon has mottles in shades of red, yellow or brown.\nThe 2Bt part of 2Bt/E or E/2Bt horizons has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam.  The 2E part has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3.  Content of slightly brittle areas range from 0 to 40 percent.  Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles in shades of red, yellow and brown range from none to many.  Most pedons have subhorizons that do not have a matrix color but are mottled in shades of red, yellow and brown.  Texture of the 2Bt horizon is clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay or clay.  Most pedons have streaks and pockets with colors in shades of red, yellow, and brown that are inherent of the parent material.  Some pedons have a few gray mottles below about 30 inches.  Some pedons have a few ironstone fragments along the upper boundary of the 2Bt horizon.  Content of rounded quartz gravel up to 2 inches in diameter ranges from 0 to 5 percent."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aycock, Bewleyville, Blevins, Curtistown, and Mountview series in the same family and the similar Allen, Avilla, Bama, Etowah, Holston, Leesburg, Minvale, Orangeburg, Pikeville, Ruston, and Warnock series.  Aycock soils do not have a lithology discontinuity.  The lower part of the solum of Bewleyville and Mountview  soils formed in old alluvium or residuum of limestone.  Blevins soils do not have a lithology discontinuity and have bisequal clay distribution.  Curtistown soils have surface layers with value and chroma of 3 or less.  Allen, Avilla, Bama, Etowah, Holston, Leesburg, Minvale, Orangeburg, Pikeville, Ruston, and Warnock soils are fine-loamy."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY SETTING:  Silerton soils are on gently sloping to sloping ridgetops and plateau-like areas.  The soil formed in a silty mantle 1.5 to 3 feet thick and in the underlying Coastal Plain clayey sediments.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.  Near the type location, the average annual precipitation is about 54 inches and the average annual temperature is about 62 degrees F."

Brandon soils, on slightly higher positions, have solum thickness of 20 to 40 inches and mixed mineralogy.   Dulac soils, on adjacent positions, have a fragipan.  Lexington soils, on slightly higher positions, have base saturation of 35 percent or more.  Luverne soils, on slightly higher positions, are clayey.  Saffell soils, on nearby steep hillsides, are loamy-skeletal."
