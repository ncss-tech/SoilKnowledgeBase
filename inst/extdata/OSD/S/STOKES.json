They formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources, the surface of which may have been reworked by wind and water.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 4,270 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."
