  "OVERVIEW": "The Stokes series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Stokes soils are on low lake terraces and lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
