  "OVERVIEW": "The Stodick series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium and material weathered from softly consolidated sedimentary rocks.  The Stodick soils are on foothills and have 4 to 50 percent slopes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
