These soils formed in mixed alluvium and residuum derived from softly consolidated sedimentary rocks (Truckee and Coal Valley Formations).  The climate is cool, semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of 200 to 250 mm.  The average annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 95 to ll0 days."
