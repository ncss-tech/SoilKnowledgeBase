Rock fragments content by volume ranges from 5 to 35 percent in the A and B horizons, and from 10 to 40 percent in the C horizon. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid in the solum and substratum.\nThe O horizon, when present, has a hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 1 through 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from silt loam through sandy loam. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe E or Eg horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from loam through sandy loam. Consistence is friable or very friable. Some pedons have redoximorphic features in this horizon.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 through 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture of the fine earth fraction ranges from silt loam through sandy loam. Structure is weak subangular blocky or the horizon is massive.  Consistence is friable or firm.

The Monarda series was in the same family, but has not been classified for CEC activity class. The Monarda soils have hues of 10YR or yellower in the C horizon.\nBusti, Lyme, Neversink, and Sun are similar soils in related families. The Busti and Sun soils are nonacid and in the mesic temperature regime. The Neversink soils are in the mesic temperature regime. Lyme soils have a hue 10YR or yellower in the C horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Suny soils are on level or depressed parts of till plains in the uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in acid glacial till derived from sandstone, siltstone and shale. The climate is humid and cool in summer and cold in winter. Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation is 45 to 60 inches; and the mean annual frost-free period ranges from 100 to 120 days. Elevation ranges from 1800 to 2400 feet above sea level."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Suny series was established as the frigid analog of the Neversink series and the acid and frigid equivalent of the Sun soils. Original classification placed Suny in the great group of Haplaquepts. Because of changes established in the 5th edition of `Keys to Soil Taxonomy' this soil now classifies in the new great group of Epiaquepts. Competing series are expected to change as similar soils are reclassified and when the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 7th edition is fully implemented. Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon - from 1 to 5 inches (A and E horizons)\n2) Cambic horizon - from 5 to 19 inches (Bg1 and Bg2 horizons)\n3) Aquic moisture conditions - as evidenced by low chroma (2 or less) matrix and redoximorphic features within 20 inches of the soil surface (Bg horizons)\n4) Aeric subgroup - as evidenced by a horizon within 30 inches of the soil surface that is dominated (50 percent or more) by chroma of 3 or more (C horizon- 19 to >30 inches)\nSoil Interpretation Record No: NY0337, NY0338\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
