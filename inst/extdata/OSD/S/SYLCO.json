  "OVERVIEW": "The Sylco series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on mountain ridge summits and side slopes in the Blue Ridge (MLRA 130). They formed in residuum that is affected by soil creep in the upper part, and weathered from metasedimentary rocks such as phyllite, slate, and metsandstone. Slope ranges from 7 to 95 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to slate, metasandstone, or phyllite bedrock that is not fractured enough to contain some fine material ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Amount of thin, flat fragments of phyllite, metasandstone, or of slate ranges from about 10 to 50 percent in the A horizon, 15 to 45 percent in the B horizon, and from 40 to 70 percent in the C horizon. The average content of these fragments between 10 inches and bedrock ranges from 35 to 50 percent. Fragments are channers, flagstones, or stones. The amount of weatherable minerals, mainly chlorite, sericite, and hydrobiotite, exceeds 30 percent in the silt and sand fractions. The soil is extremely acid to strongly acid. Transition horizons have colors and textures similar to adjacent horizons.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. The A2 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. The A horizon is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5 or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, has colors and texture similar to the Bw horizon, but contains more rock fragments."

Berks, Brownstown, Calvin, Judyville, Manlius, and Matewan soils formed from sedimentary rocks such as shale, siltstone, and sandstone and contain fragments of these rocks. Blasdell, Cadosia, Centralpark, Highspint, Jubin, Warwick, and Wyoming soils Have bedrock at depths greater than 60 inches. Brownsville and Deadline soils have bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Keyesville and Lippett soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Nailkeg and Peaks soils formed from high grade metamorphic rocks and contain fragments of those rocks."

Slope gradients range from 7 to 95 percent, but most areas as are 35 to 95 percent. The soil formed in residuum that is affected by soil creep in the upper part, and weathered from metasedimentary rocks such as metasandstone, slate and phyllite. Estimated mean annual temperature at the type location is about 54 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation about 52 inches."

Cataska soils formed in residuum and have paralithic contact at less than 20 inches. Jeffrey, Soco, and Stecoah soils formed in residuum and contain less than 35 percent rock fragments."
