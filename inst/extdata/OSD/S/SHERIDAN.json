  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact of weathered granite is 25 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 59 F. to 64 F. and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 F. at any time.  The soils between depths of about 8 and 25 inches usually are dry all of the time from May until November or early December and are moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.  The 10 to 40 inch control section is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam or light loam with less than 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon is dark gray, grayish brown, dark grayish brown, very dark grayish brown or dark brown.  It has weak to strong granular or subangular blocky structure.  This horizon ranges from medium acid to neutral.  It has 1 to 5 percent organic matter in all parts to a depth of more than 20 inches and less than 1 percent within a depth of 30 inches.  Base saturation is 75 to 95 percent.\nA C horizon of sandy loam or loamy sand soil material is present in some pedons above the weathered rock and in other pedons the A horizons grade directly to weathered rock."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Anacapa, Arroyo Seco, Elder, Pfeiffer, Pico, San Andreas, and Shaver series.  Anacapa soils are calcareous in the lower part and lack a paralithic contact.  Arroyo Seco and Pico soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick and lack a paralithic contact.  Elder soils are stratified and lack a paralithic contact.  Pfeiffer and San Andreas soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick and Pfeiffer soils have a paralithic contact below a depth of 40 inches.  Shaver soils have base saturation of 50 to 75 percent and a mean annual soil temperature of less than 59 F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Sheridan soils are moderately sloping to very steep and are on hills at elevations of 1,000 to 3,000 feet on north or south slopes and up to 5,000 feet6 on south facing slopes.  They formed in residuum weathered from granite, schist, and related rocks.  The climate is subhumid, mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 50 inches.  Average January temperature is about 48 F. to 52 F.; average July temperature is about 70 F.; mean annual temperature is about 57 F. to 63 F.  The freeze-free season is 170 to 250 days."
