  "OVERVIEW": "The Spooky series consists of deep, excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and eolian sand derived from Navajo sandstone. Spooky soils are on dunes on structural benches. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
