  "OVERVIEW": "The Selma series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loamy outwash. They are on nearly level or slightly depressional parts of outwash plains, stream terraces, or lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",

In the undrained condition, the apparent seasonal high water table is 15 centimeters (0.5 foot) above the surface to 15 centimeters (0.5 foot) below the surface at some time between November and June in most years.
