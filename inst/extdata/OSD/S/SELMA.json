Clyde, Letri, Marengo, Reddick, Tripoli, Webster, and Wolcott soils generally average more than 15 percent clay and less than 50 percent total sand in the lower part of the series control section. Faxon and Mound Creek soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 centimeters (60 inches). Kossuth soils average more than 30 percent clay in the upper part of the particle-size control section.

Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Selma soils formed in loamy material 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) thick and typically are underlain by stratified coarse-textured materials. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1016 mm (34 to 40 inches), frost-free period ranges from 155 to 190 days, and elevation ranges from 137 to 292 meters (450 to 960 feet) above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Darroch soils and the well drained Jasper soils are in a drainage sequence with the Selma soils and are on higher landform positions. Gilford soils are coarse-loamy and on similar landform positions nearby. La Hogue and Ridgeville soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on slightly higher landform positions."

Where drained, the apparent seasonal high water table is 15 centimeters (0.5 foot) above the surface to 30 centimeters (1.0 foot) below the surface at some time between January and May in most years. In the undrained condition, the apparent seasonal high water table is 15 centimeters (0.5 foot) above the surface to 15 centimeters (0.5 foot) below the surface at some time between November and June in most years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate."
