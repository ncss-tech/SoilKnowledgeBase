    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to seasonal high water table is 50 through 94 cm. The water table may be tidally influenced. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through neutral. Soils are non-saline through moderately saline throughout.\nThe A horizon, when present, has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 3.  The texture is fine sand or sand. Gravel content is 0 through 8 percent.\nThe AC or CA horizon, when present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is fine sand through coarse sand. Gravel content is 0 to 5 percent.\nThe C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 4. Texture is fine sand through coarse sand. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 34 percent above 1 meter and 0 to 60 percent below 1 meter.\nThe Cg horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is sand through coarse sand. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 34 percent above 1 meter and 0 to 60 percent below 1 meter.\nSome pedons contain a thin buried Oe, Oa or A horizons. When present the O or Ab horizon is 5 to 15 cm thick and has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Buried horizons typically represent former tidal marshes that have been covered by storm events."

The Algansee and Meckling soils formed in sandy alluvium. Altmar, Brem, Deerfield and Morocco formed in sandy outwash. Birchwood soils have a densic contact within a 100 centimeters. Brockatonorton soils formed in a slightly warmer climate on the on the mid Atlantic coastal plain and the northern tidewater area.  Livonia soils have a B horizon that is 38 to 97 cm thick. Elnora, Ottokee, Tedrow and Zaborosky soils formed on glacial lake plain landscapes. Partridge soils have a lithic contact between 50 and 100 centimeters."

Sandyhook soils are very poorly drained tidally flooded soils on back-barriers. Nagunt and Massapog soils are subaqueous soils on flood tidal deltas, back-barriers, and washover fans. Pawcatuck soils have organic horizons 40 to 130 centimeters thick. Matunuck soils have a histic epipedon less than 40 centimeters thick. Matunuk, Pawcatuck, and Sandyhook are tidally flooded, and are on nearby salt marshes."
