  "STATES": "RI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Succotash series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are on back barriers of barrier islands and spits and in low-lying areas along the coastal zone. They are formed in sandy eolian and/or coastal overwash deposits  of marine origin. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high throughout. Slope ranges from 0 through 3 percent, mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C., and mean annual precipitation is about 1142 mm.",

Soils are non-saline through moderately saline throughout.\nThe A horizon, when present, has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 3.  The texture is fine sand or sand. Gravel content is 0 through 8 percent.\nThe AC or CA horizon, when present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is fine sand through coarse sand. Gravel content is 0 to 5 percent.\nThe C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 4. Texture is fine sand through coarse sand. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 34 percent above 1 meter and 0 to 60 percent below 1 meter.\nThe Cg horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is sand through coarse sand. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 34 percent above 1 meter and 0 to 60 percent below 1 meter.\nSome pedons contain a thin buried Oe, Oa or A horizons. When present the O or Ab horizon is 5 to 15 cm thick and has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Buried horizons typically represent former tidal marshes that have been covered by storm events."

The Algansee and Meckling soils formed in sandy alluvium. Altmar, Brem, Deerfield and Morocco formed in sandy outwash. Birchwood soils have a densic contact within a 100 centimeters. Brockatonorton soils formed in a slightly warmer climate on the on the mid Atlantic coastal plain and the northern tidewater area.  Livonia soils have a B horizon that is 38 to 97 cm thick. Elnora, Ottokee, Tedrow and Zaborosky soils formed on glacial lake plain landscapes. Partridge soils have a lithic contact between 50 and 100 centimeters."
