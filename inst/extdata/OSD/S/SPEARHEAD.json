  "OVERVIEW": "The Spearhead series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from calcareous sedimentary or metamorphic rocks.  Spearhead soils are on steep to extremely steep mountain sides.  The average annual precipitation is about 35 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 30 to 34 degrees F.",

This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C or Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  It has 1 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."
