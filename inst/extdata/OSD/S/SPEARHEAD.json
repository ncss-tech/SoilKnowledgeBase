  "OVERVIEW": "The Spearhead series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from calcareous sedimentary or metamorphic rocks.  Spearhead soils are on steep to extremely steep mountain sides.  The average annual precipitation is about 890 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 0 degrees C.",
