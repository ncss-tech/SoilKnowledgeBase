Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral (5.6 to 7.3).\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe E horizon, when present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It has textures of gravelly or very gravelly loam or sandy loam, or loam.  Rock fragments are pebble size and range from 30 to 50 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, values of 4 through 7, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is very gravelly sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Rock fragments are pebble size and range from 35 to 55 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, values of 5 or 6, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Textures are very gravelly or extremely gravelly sandy loam.  Rock fragments are pebble size and range from 40 to 65 percent.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered granite (grus).  When excavated, it becomes strong brown, extremely gravelly sand, or strong brown, extremely gravelly loamy sand.  The pebble size fractions range from 1/8 inch to 1 1/2 inch in diameter and comprise 80 to 90 percent of this horizon."
