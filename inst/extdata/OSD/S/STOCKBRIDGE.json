  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is commonly more than 6 feet.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent to a depth of 40 inches and up to 50 percent below 40 inches.  Except where the surface layer is stony, the fragments are mostly subrounded pebbles and typically make up 60 percent or more of the total rock fragments.  The soil is strongly acid to neutral in the surface layer, moderately acid to neutral to a depth of 40 inches and moderately acid to moderately alkaline below 40 inches.  Depth to carbonates is greater than 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4 and chroma of 1 through 3.  Dry value is 6 or more.  Undisturbed pedons have a thin A horizon with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 through 3.  The Ap or A horizon is loam, silt loam or very fine sandy loam in the fine earth.  It has weak or moderate granular structure and is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y in the upper part and hue of 10YR through 5Y in the lower part.  Value is 4 through 6 and chroma is 3 through 6.  Texture of the Bw horizon is loam or silt loam in the fine earth.  Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky.  Some pedons have subhorizons that are massive.  Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 4.  Some pedons have faint redoximorphic features below a depth of 30 inches.  Texture is dominantly loam on silt loam in the fine earth, but ranges to fine sandy loam below a depth of 40 inches.  The C horizon is platy or massive and firm or very firm."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no soils currently in the same family.\nBernardston, Charlton, Dover, Dutchess, Grenville, Herkimer, Lowville, Nellis, Paxton, Pittsfield and Urne series are similar soils in closely related families.  Urne soils are from outside LRR R.\nBernardston, Charlton, Dutchess, and Paxton soils have less than 60 percent base saturation.  Dover, Grenville, and Nellis soils have carbonates within a depth of 40 inches.  Herkimer soils formed in water-sorted deposits and are dominated by dark shale rock fragments.  Lowville soils have a silty mantle.  Pittsfield soils have less than 50 percent silt plus very fine sand in the particle-size control section and have a friable substratum.  Urne soils have bedrock within a depth of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stockbridge soils are nearly level to very steep soils on glaciated hills associated with limestone valleys.  They are commonly on smooth low hills in valleys or on smooth footslopes that grade into acid till hills.  Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent, but are dominantly 3 to 25 percent.  Stockbridge soils formed in loamy till derived mainly from limestone, schist and quartzite.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 36 to 48 inches and the growing season is 120 to 175 days."

Moderately well drained Amenia and Georgia soils, somewhat poorly drained Kendaia soils, somewhat poorly drained and poorly drained Massena soils and very poorly drained Alden and Lyons soils are common drainage associates.  Copake, Fredon, Groton and Hero soils are on nearby terraces and glaciofluvial landforms."
