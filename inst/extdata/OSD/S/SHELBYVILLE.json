The soil ranges from neutral to strongly acid in the upper part of the solum, and from strongly acid to mildly alkaline in the lower part.  Limestone, siltstone, chert, or shale fragments range from 0 to 15 percent\nin the lower solum and C horizons.  Dark brown or black concretions from 1 to 5 mm in diameter range from 1 to 20 percent and stains, films, and nodules are few to common in the lower solum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value less than 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has weak or moderate fine or medium\ngranular or subangular blocky structure.  Some pedons have AB or\nBA horizons with colors and textures like the Ap or Bt horizons.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 4 or\n5, and chroma of 4 or 6. It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Structure is weak or moderate fine or medium blocky, and it is friable or firm.\nThe Bt2 and Bt3 horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or\n5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Some pedons are mottled in shades of\nbrown.  The texture, structure, and consistence are like the Bt1 horizon.\nThe 2B horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 to\n6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons are mottled in shades of\nbrown, gray, or olive.  It is silty clay or clay.  Structure is\nweak or moderate, fine to coarse, blocky.  Some pedons have a 2C\nor 2BC horizon with matrix and mottles in shades of brown, gray,\nor olive.  It is silty clay or clay."
