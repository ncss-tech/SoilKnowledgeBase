  "OVERVIEW": "The Shellrock series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in material weathered from granite. Shellrock soils are on mountains and have slopes of 12 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 675 mm, and the average annual air temperature is about 5.0 degrees C.",
