  "OVERVIEW": "The Spliten series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in side slope alluvium and loess over residuum weathered from basalt and rhyolite.  Permeability is moderate.  They are on basalt plains, caldera floors, and rhyolite terraces and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

The Duncom, Jenkinson,  and Trump soils contain carbonates in some parts of the profile.  Hazton and Udelope soils lack B horizons.  Ganis soils have average annual soil temperature of 42 to 44 degrees F. and have a cambic horizon.  Hanagita soils have average annual soil temperature of 32 to 35 degrees F.  Heisspitz soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Lotex soils have Hues of 5YR or redder throughout.  Dickle and Skisams soils have more than 18 percent clay in the control section.   The Splitro soils receive most of their moisture during the summer months.  Tuggle soils have Cr horizons above a lithic contact and are dominated by granitic rock fragments.  Udelope soils are dry longer than 60 consecutive days and have a mollic epipedon 8 to 20 inches and includes the entire profile."
