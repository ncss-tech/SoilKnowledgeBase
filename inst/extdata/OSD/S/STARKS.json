  "OVERVIEW": "The Starks series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy stratified outwash. They are on outwash plains, stream terraces, and alluvial fans. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches).",
