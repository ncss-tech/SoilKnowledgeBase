These soils are usually moist but they are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and l2 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section contains 35 to 60 percent clay, 0 to l0 percent unweathered pebbles and 0 to l0 percent weathered pebble-size siltstone and sandstone fragments.  Thin gravelly lenses are in some profiles.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe AB horizon, and BA horizon when present, has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam, silty clay loam, or silt loam.  It is slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6 moist, 5 through 8 dry, and chroma of 2 or 6 moist and dry.  Mottles have hue of l0YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 8 moist and dry, chroma of 2 through 8 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. It is moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nThe BCt horizon, when present, has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Melbourne, Munset, and Spreckles series. Munset soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Melbourne soils have no mottles in the argillic horizon.  Spreckles soils are very gravelly in the lower part of the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sauvola soils are on terraces and foothills at elevations of l50 to 900 feet.  Slope is 0 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in residuum, from non-marine micaceous siltstone of the Wilkes formation or old alluvium.  The climate is marine and characterized by cool, dry summers and mild, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation is 45 to 55 inches.  The average January temperature is 39 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 66 degrees F.; and the average annual temperature is about 5l degrees F.  The frost-free season (32 degrees F.) is l50 to 200 days.  The growing season (28 degrees F.) is l75 to 240 days."
