  "OVERVIEW": "The Sauvola series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in residuum from siltstone or old alluvium.  Sauvola soils are on terraces and foothills at elevations of l50 to 900 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 50 inches and average annual temperature is about 5l degrees F.",
