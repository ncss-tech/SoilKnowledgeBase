  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Skaggs series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from limestone, limy shale, or calcareous sandstone. These soils are on hills. Slopes range from 2 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
