Depth to mudstone bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the A and Bw horizons and from strongly acid to neutral in the BC and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma from 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, their gravelly or cobbly analogs.\nThe Bw horizon has hue from 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is clay loam, clay, their gravelly or cobbly analogs.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue from 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is clay loam, clay, their gravelly or cobbly analogs.\nThe C horizon has hue from 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6; or there is no dominate color and is multicolored in shades of brown, yellow, and gray.  Texture is loam, clay loam, their gravelly or cobbly analogs.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, has same range of colors as the C horizon.  It is composed of highly weathered mudstone that has a loam or clay loam texture.\nThe R horizon is composed of mudstone bedrock."

They formed in residuum that weathered from calcareous mudstone of the Hato Puerco formation.  Slopes range from 20 to 60 percent.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual temperature ranges from 75 to 77 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 75 to 80 inches."
