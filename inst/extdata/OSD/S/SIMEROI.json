  "OVERVIEW": "The Simeroi series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from limestone. Permeability is moderate. Simeroi soils are on outwash fans, fan terraces, fan remnants, and foothills and have slopes of 1 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
