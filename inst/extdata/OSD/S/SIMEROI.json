The soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from limestone. There is a minor component of loess in the upper part of some pedons. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 44 degrees F. Mean summer temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 12 inches. Frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."

Mogg soils are on mountains and are shallow to bedrock. Ringle and Whitecloud soils are on fan terraces and have sandy-skeletal control sections."
