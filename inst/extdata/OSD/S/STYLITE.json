  "OVERVIEW": "The Stylite series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from gypsiferous sediments.  These soils are on low ridges and hillslopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
