  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from about 24 to 45 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 5 feet. Reaction in each horizon ranges from medium acid through neutral.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent  within the upper 40 inches and from 0 to 40 percent below 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 2 or 3. The texture is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or rarely 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Mottles in shades of brown, gray, and yellow range from none to common in the lower part of the B horizon.  The texture is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.  In the particle size control section, clay content averages between 18 and 27 percent, sand content between 20 and 60 percent and silt content is 20 percent or more.\nSome pedons have a C horizon either immediately below the A horizon or the B horizon.  The C horizon has properties similar to those given for the B horizon except that it is massive."

Cannon soils have more than 15 percent chert or gravel in the upper 40 inches.  Gowton soils to not contain mica flakes.  Arrington soils are fine-silty and Egam soils are fine.  Godown soils are fine and have chroma of 2 or less below the surface layer.  Huntington soils are fine-silty and are mesic.  Lynnville soils are fine-silty and have gray mottles immediately below the mollic epipedon."
