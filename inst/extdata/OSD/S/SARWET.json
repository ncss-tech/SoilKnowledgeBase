    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, depth and thickness are measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 35 to more than 80 inches. Clay content averages from 5 to 17 percent and content of fine sand or coarser averages from 45 to 70 percent in the particle-size control section.  Volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section. Volume of gravel ranges from 1 to 40 percent and volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the pedon.  Volume of stones ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout and a very stony phase is recognized in some places.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum but ranges to neutral in an Ap horizon, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid below the spodic horizon.  Redox accumulations are below the spodic horizon but within 40 inches. Saturation occurs within 40 inches for 1 month or more per year in most years.\nSome pedons have an O horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or the hue is neutral.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.  The O horizon is a mat of partially decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A or Ap horizon is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. The E horizon is typically loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly, very gravelly, or cobbly analogs but in some pedons it is loam or the gravelly, very gravelly, or cobbly analogs.\nSome pedons have a Bhs horizon less than 3 inches thick with hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Typically, it is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly, very gravelly, or cobbly analogs, but in some pedons it is loam or the gravelly, very gravelly, or cobbly analogs.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6, or it has hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.  It has texture like the Bhs horizon above.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon with color like the E horizon described above.  It is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or the gravelly, very gravelly, or cobbly analogs.\nSarwet soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E' horizon above.  The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly, very gravelly, or cobbly analogs but some pedons have subhorizons of loamy sand or the gravelly, very gravelly, or cobbly analog.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.

Padwood soils have more than 85 percent sand in the fine earth fraction within the series control section at a depth of 24 and 40 inches and have stratified loamy and sandy textures (lacustrine material) at 40 to 60 inches.  Peavy soils do not have a glossic horizon.  Shoepac soils have 18 to 30 percent clay in the argillic horizon.
