  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Auburn, Millsholm, Spinnaker, and Toomes series.  Auburn soils formed in metavolcanic rock, have 5YR hues in the Bw horizons, and have R horizons that contain amphibolite schist that range to more than 20 inches deep within the profile.  Millsholm soils formed in material weathered from sandstone, mudstone, and shale and have R horizons that contain fractured shale and fine-grained sandstone. Spinnaker soils have Cr horizons that contain highly fractured, brittle andesite, and have a paralithic contact above the lithic contact.  Toomes soils formed in tuff breccia composed of angular and subangular basaltic rock fragments cemented together by light gray, fine textured, tuffaceous sediments and do not have coarse-loamy textures in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

These soils formed in eolian deposits and alluvium derived from ancestral river channel deposits over residuum weathered from latite. Elevation is 800 to 1500 feet (244 to 457 meters). The climate is subhumid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 483 to 686 millimeters (19 to 27 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F (16 to 18 degrees C). The frost free season is 235 to 285 days."

(A, Bw1, and Bw2)\nOchric epipedon: zone from 0 to 1 inch, (0 to 2 cm). (A)\nCambic horizon: zone from 1 to 13 inches, (2 to 33 cm). (Bw1 and Bw2)\nLithic contact: 13 inches, (33 cm) (R)\nThese soils were formerly, loosely mapped as Toomes soils in the Soil Vegetation Survey of California.  See remarks in the Toomes Official Series Description:\nFurther study is needed to determine if the Toomes soils mapped in scattered locations throughout California meet the current concept of Toomes. Soils mapped as Toomes in Antelope Valley Area and Northern Santa Barbara Area should be considered taxadjuncts to the series. Therefore Semoot is set up to fill the situation in the Sierra Foothills.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNASIS PEDON ID: 06CA630SMM006\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
