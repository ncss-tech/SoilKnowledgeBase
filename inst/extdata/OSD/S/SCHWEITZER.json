  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Laona series in the same family and the Frohling, McBride, Soperton and Steuben series.  Laona soils lack an eolian mantle and have more than 30 percent very coarse, coarse and medium sand in the upper part of the particle size control section and lack Bhs horizons.  Frohling soils have an active activity class and average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.  McBride soils lack an eolian mantle and have more than 30 percent very coarse, coarse and medium sand in the upper part of the particle size control section.  Soperton soils lack Bhs horizon and have a fragipan that is less than 12 inches thick.  Steuben soils soils average more than 85 percent sand in the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Schweitzer soils occur on ground moraines and end moraines.  These moraines are often bedrock-controlled over igneous and metamorphic bedrock, especially iron-bearing slate formations.  Slopes range from 6 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in loamy eolian deposits over cobbly and gravelly red colored loamy and sandy till.  Elevations range from 1,000 to 1,800 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 35 to 40 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 39 to 43 degrees F.  The frost free period is about 100 to 130 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Schweitzer soils are associated with the moderately deep Michigamme and shallow Peshekee soils in areas near rock outcrops.  The moderately well drained Gogebic soils are a common associate on lower landscape positions.  The somewhat poorly drained Tula and the poorly drained Pleine soils are common associates occurring in drainageways and depressions."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Schweitzer soils are forested with northern hardwoods being dominant.  Sugar maple, basswood, yellow birch, eastern hemlock, ironwood, northern red oak, white ash, red maple, and american elm are common trees.  Quaking aspen, white birch, and balsam fir may be common in areas that have been logged and burned.  Understory vegetation includes spinulose shield fern, downy yellow violet, canadian white violet, sedges, red elderberry, sweet cicely, large leaved aster, twisted stalk, hairy solomon's seal, false solomon's seal, and wild lily-of-the-valley."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 5 inches (A and E horizons); Albic horizon - the zone from 1 to 5 inches (E horizon); Spodic horizon - the zone from 5 to 21 inches (Bhs, Bs1, and Bs2 horizons); Glossic horizon - the zone from 21 to 61 inches (2(E/B)x, 2(B/E)x and 2(B/E) horizons); Argillic horizon - the zone from 27 to 61 inches (2(B/E)x and 2(B/E) horizons); Fragipan - the zone from 21 to 43 inches (2(E/B)x and 2(B/E)x horizons).  One or any combination of the above fragipan horizons may occur in a pedon.  The fragipan horizons are commonly 10 to 30 inches thick and occur both above and below the contact between the loamy cap and underlying glacial till.  Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 21 inches.\nThe loamy eolian mantle has been modified by windthrow action and post-glacial erosion.\nThis soil replaces the well drained phase of the Gogebic series.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to NSSL S93MI-103-1 for laboratory dataon this pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
