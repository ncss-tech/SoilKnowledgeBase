  "OVERVIEW": "The Schweitzer series consists of well drained soils, which are shallow to moderately deep to a fragipan.  They formed in modified loamy and silty eolian deposits and in the underlying cobbly and gravelly loamy and sandy till on ground moraines and end moraines.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the profile, very slow in the fragipan, and moderate in the lower part.  Slopes range from 6 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Sugar maple, basswood, yellow birch, eastern hemlock, ironwood, northern red oak, white ash, red maple, and american elm are common trees.  Quaking aspen, white birch, and balsam fir may be common in areas that have been logged and burned.  Understory vegetation includes spinulose shield fern, downy yellow violet, canadian white violet, sedges, red elderberry, sweet cicely, large leaved aster, twisted stalk, hairy solomon's seal, false solomon's seal, and wild lily-of-the-valley."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 5 inches (A and E horizons); Albic horizon - the zone from 1 to 5 inches (E horizon); Spodic horizon - the zone from 5 to 21 inches (Bhs, Bs1, and Bs2 horizons); Glossic horizon - the zone from 21 to 61 inches (2(E/B)x, 2(B/E)x and 2(B/E) horizons); Argillic horizon - the zone from 27 to 61 inches (2(B/E)x and 2(B/E) horizons); Fragipan - the zone from 21 to 43 inches (2(E/B)x and 2(B/E)x horizons).  One or any combination of the above fragipan horizons may occur in a pedon.  The fragipan horizons are commonly 10 to 30 inches thick and occur both above and below the contact between the loamy cap and underlying glacial till.  Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 21 inches.\nThe loamy eolian mantle has been modified by windthrow action and post-glacial erosion.\nThis soil replaces the well drained phase of the Gogebic series."
