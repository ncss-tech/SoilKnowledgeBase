  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 38 to 78 inches thick.  Calcium-magnesium ratio is more than 1.0.  The COLE value in the upper 20 inches of the B horizon is 0.09 or more.  The soil ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid in the solum and from medium acid to moderately alkaline in the C horizon.  Depth to the neutral or alkaline part of the C horizon ranges from 38 to 96 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe Bt horizon to a depth of 30 inches or more has 60 percent or more of the matrix in hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, or it is neutral with value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 0; mottles in shades of brown and yellow are few to many.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has the same color range as the upper part and, in addition, includes a matrix with hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4, or it is mottled in shades of gray, yellow, or brown.  The Bt horizon is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  It has from 38 to 60 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has the same color range as the Bt horizon.  It is clay or marly clay in the upper part and marly clay or weathered chalk in the lower part.  Some pedons are underlain by chalk or marl."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include Baldwin, Mayhew, Panola, Tensas, and Wilson series in the same family and the closely related Eutaw, Kipling, Mayhew, Midland, and Oktibbeha series.  Baldwin soils are slightly acid to mildly alkaline in the Bt horizon and have dark coatings on surfaces of peds in the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Mayhew soils have a calcium-magnesium ratio of less than 1 and are underlain by shale.  Panola and Tensas soils are not as gray in the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Wilson soils are in areas with less than 45 inches of rainfall and are dry in the moisture control section for longer periods.  Eutaw soils are very-fine in the particle-size control section and have intersecting slickensides.  Kipling and Oktibbeha soils have a Bt horizon with a chroma of 3 or more; also, Oktibbeha soils are very-fine in the particle size control section.  Midland soils are slightly acid to mildly alkaline in the Bt horizon and have a COLE value of less than 0.09 in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sessum soils are on nearly level to gently sloping uplands in the Blackland Prairie Major Land Resource Area.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in acid clayey sediments and the underlying calcareous clay or chalk.  The climate is warm and humid.  Mean annual temperature is 68 degrees Fahrenheit, and mean annual precipitation is 51.0 inches near the type location."
