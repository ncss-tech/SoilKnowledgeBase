All these series, except Deuchars,  Tarhollow and Westgate do not have a paralithic contact in the series control section. Deuchars soils average more than 14 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Tarhollow soils dominantly have siltstone channers and not pararock fragments in the lower part of the series control section and have a total amount of fragments less than 20 percent in the 2BC horizons. Westgate soils are neutral to moderately alkaline in the lower part of the series control section."
