    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ashburn, Blocher, Deuchars, Gallipolis, Jeneva, Percell, Tarhollow and Westgate series.  All these series, except Deuchars,  Tarhollow and Westgate do not have a paralithic contact in the series control section. Deuchars soils average more than 14 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Tarhollow soils dominantly have siltstone channers and not pararock fragments in the lower part of the series control section and have a total amount of fragments less than 20 percent in the 2BC horizons. Westgate soils are neutral to moderately alkaline in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Stonehead soils are on hills underlain with shale or siltstone. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. Stonehead soils formed in 64 to 102 cm (25 to 40 inches) of loess and the underlying residuum weathered from soft shale or soft siltstone bedrock. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches), and mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free days range from 170 to 200. Elevation ranges from 104 to 305 meters (340 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."
