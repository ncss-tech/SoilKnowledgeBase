  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Stovall series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy valley fill alluvium predominantly from limestone hills and mountains materials.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on alluvial flats, broad upland plains and valleys.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.",
