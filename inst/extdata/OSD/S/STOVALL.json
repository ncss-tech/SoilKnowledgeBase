Hoban soils have gypsic horizons between 40 and 60 inches.  Poquita soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the Bk horizons. Quay, Poquita, and Reagan soils have calcic horizons beginning between 15 and 40 inches.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Stovall soils are on broad nearly level to gently sloping plains, valleys, alluvial flats, and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The soil formed in medium to moderately fine textured alluvial materials that are high in calcium carbonate.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 60 to 65 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 200 to 260 days, and elevation ranges from 3,200 to 4,500 feet."
