This soil is moderately acid to very strongly acid unless limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, sandy loam or silt loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, sandy loam or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 3 through 6.  In some places, parent material mottling is common in the lower part of the B horizon.  It is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon is commonly variegated in shades of red, brown, yellow, green and white.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or sandy clay loam in the fine earth fraction."

The Athol, Brecknock, Carpenter, Neshaminy, and Westmoreland soils have bedrock from 40 to 60 inches.  The Bolton and Morrison soils have chert Rock fragments and underlain with limestone.  The Bookwood, Culleoka, Frondorf, Loudonville and Penn soils have bedrock from 20 to 40 inches deep.  The Door soils have a mollic surface layer.  The Dormont soils have slow permeability.  The Duffield soils are from shale and limestone.  The Grayford, Lamotte, and Williamsburg soils have a loess capping.  Hayter soils are developed from colluvium from Appalachian sedimentory rock.  The Legore soils is underlain with diabase or diorite bedrock and have diabase and diorite Rock fragments.  The Manassas soils formed in colluvial and may not have rock fragments and bedrock more than 60 inches.  The Myersville soil have crystalline rock fragments and are underlain by greenstone or metabasalt.  The Ryder soils have bedrock from 24 to 40 inches.  The Washington soils have chert rock fragments and formed in glacial drift or colluvium.  The Wheeling soils have rounded water-worked rock fragments and are underlain by sand or sand and gravel."
