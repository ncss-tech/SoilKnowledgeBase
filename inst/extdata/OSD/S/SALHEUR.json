  "OVERVIEW": "The Salheur series consists of shallow over duripan, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium. Salheur soils are on pediments and fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
