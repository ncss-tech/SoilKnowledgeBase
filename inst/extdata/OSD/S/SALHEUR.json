Changed 11/19/2008.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to about 0 to 10 cm (A horizon).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from about 10 to 37 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nDuripan  The zone from about 37 to 39 cm.\nAshy textures - Volcanic glass is 30 to 50 percent of the 0.02 to 2 mm fraction in the zone from 0 to 10 cm (A horizon). Volcanic glass is 5 to 25 percent of the 0.02 to 2 mm fraction in the zone from 10 to 30 cm (Bt1 horizon).\nAbrupt textural boundary  Between the Bt1 and Bt2 horizons, at approximately 30 cm.\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 37 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
