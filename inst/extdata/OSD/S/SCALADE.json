  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Scalade series consists of shallow over a duripan, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from granite, limestone and quartzite with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Scalade soils are on dissected pediments, fan remnants and hills.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

The particle-size control section averages 5 to 18 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent rock fragments.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is usually dry, but is moist in some part 20 to 35 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  It is dry in all parts for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Aridic bordering Xeric soil moisture regime.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 3 to 15 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, and very fine sandy loam.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 3 to 15 percent.\nThe Bkq horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 3 to 4.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 40 percent.  Electrical conductivity of the saturation extract is 2 to 4 mmhos/cm.\nThe Bkqm horizon is strongly to weakly cemented.  It is strongly cemented in some part.\nThe Bk horizon is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  This material is commonly stratified with weakly to strongly cemented layers at depths below 40 inches."
