Arizo soils have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections and are found in inset fans. Cajon soils do not have durinodes and are found in inset fans. Coyote soils are on similar landscape positions but have a well developed calcic horizon in addition to durinodes. Gravesumit soils are found on adjacent fans and have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section with a calcic and an argillic horizon. Hollyhills soils are on eroded summits and side slopes of the same landscape and have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section and a zone which is characterized by slight to strong salinity."
