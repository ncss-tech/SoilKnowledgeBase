Abscota, Chute, Hodge and Spary soils are neutral to moderately alkaline throughout.  Biltmore soils contain mica flakes throughout.  Caesar soils are colder throughout the control section.  Dabney soils have chroma of 2 or less in the C Horizon.  Oakville, Plainfield and Tyner soils has fine sand and sand throughout the B horizon.  Penwood soils have hue of 5YR in the B horizon.  Perks, Suncook and Westport soils lack a B horizon.  Windsor soils have sola less than 40 inches thick."
