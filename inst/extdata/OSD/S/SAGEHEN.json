  "OVERVIEW": "The Sagehen series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks. Sagehen soils are on lava plateaus, mountains and hills. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sagehen soils are on lava plateaus, mountains and hills. They typically occur on south-facing backslope positions. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as basalt, welded tuff and andesite. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent. Elevations range from 1,380 to 2,170 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

Clamp soils are cryic and are on north-facing slopes. Dickle soils are cryic and are on north-facing slopes. Westbutte soils are moderately deep and have a mollic epipedon. Lonegrave soils are moderately deep to bedrock."
