  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sagehen soils are on lava plateaus, mountains and hills. They typically occur on south-facing backslope positions. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as basalt, welded tuff and andesite. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent. Elevations range from 1,380 to 2,170 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cleavage, Clamp, Dickle, Felcher and Westbutte soils. Cleavage soils have a mollic epipedon. Clamp soils are cryic and are on north-facing slopes. Dickle soils are cryic and are on north-facing slopes. Westbutte soils are moderately deep and have a mollic epipedon. Felcher soils are moderately deep to bedrock."
