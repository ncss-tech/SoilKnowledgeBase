  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Spud soils are on gently sloping to extremely steep mountainsides.  The slope is commonly 20 to 50 percent, but ranges from 5 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in fine textured alluvial, colluvial, and residual material weathered from basalt with modification from underlying sandstone and shale.  Elevation is 8,000 to 10,000 feet.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 20 inches.  The frost free period is from 80 to 100 days."
