  "OVERVIEW": "The Spud series consists of deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in fine textured alluvium, colluvium, or residuum weathered from basalt with modification from underlying sandstone and shale.  These soils are on mountainsides and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 480 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
