  "OVERVIEW": "The Spud series consists of deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in fine textured alluvial, colluvial, and residual material weathered from basalt with modification from underlying sandstone and shale.  These soils are on mountainsides and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  and the mean annual precipitation is 18 to 20 inches.",
