  "OVERVIEW": "The Seldom series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on flood plains and hills. They formed in mixed eolian material and alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 centimeters (12 inches).  Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C. (50 degrees F.)",
