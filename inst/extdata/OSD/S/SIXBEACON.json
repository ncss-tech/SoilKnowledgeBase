  "OVERVIEW": "The Sixbeacon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces and valley floors.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
