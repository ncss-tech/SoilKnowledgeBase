  "OVERVIEW": "The San Jose series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from red sandstone and shale on alluvial fans.   Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 58 degrees F.",
