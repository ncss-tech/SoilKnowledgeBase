  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: 1. With this revision the classification is changed from coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal, mixed, nonacid, frigid Typic Fluvaquents to coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal, mixed, active, nonacid, mesic Fluvaquentic Endoaquepts. This reflects Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eighth and Ninth Editions which allow soils with Aquic conditions having an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth to meet Cambic horizon criteria.\n2.  Sunny soils were historically included with Rumney in Vermont.\n3.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches.\nb. Cambic horizon  8 to 34 inches.\nc. Aquic feature  directly under the epipedon, chroma of 2 or less and redox concentrations.\nb.  Fluvaquentic feature  assumption that organic-carbon content decreases irregularly with depth or remains more than 0.2 percent to a depth of 50 inches.\nc.  Strongly contrasting particle-size class - the transition between the coarse-loamy material and the underlying sandy or sandy-skeletal material is less than 5 inches thick.  The loamy material has less than 50 percent fine or coarser sand.\nd.  Nonacid reaction class - the pH is 5.0 or more in 0.01M CaCl2 in at least some part of the control section.\ne. CEC class of active is assumed.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
