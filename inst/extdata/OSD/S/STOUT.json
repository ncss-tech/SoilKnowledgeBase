  "OVERVIEW": "The Stout series consists of shallow, well to somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in coarse-textured colluvium, slope alluvium, and residuum derived from sandstone.  Stout soils are on mesas, hills, mountains, and ridges.  Slopes range from 1 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

(Bw horizon)\nLithic contact:  The contact with sandstone at 17 inches.  (2R horizon)\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nCurrent definitions of a cambic horizon necessitated the reclassification of this series from an Ustorthent to a Haplustept.\nFurther study is needed to properly separate this series and the competing Escrito series.\nTaxonomic Version:  Tenth Edition, 2006."
