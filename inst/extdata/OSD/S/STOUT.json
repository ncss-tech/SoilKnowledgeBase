(Bw horizon)\nLithic contact:  The contact with sandstone at 17 inches.  (2R horizon)\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nCurrent definitions of a cambic horizon necessitated the reclassification of this series from an Ustorthent to a Haplustept.\nFurther study is needed to properly separate this series and the competing Escrito series.\nTaxonomic Version:  Tenth Edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
