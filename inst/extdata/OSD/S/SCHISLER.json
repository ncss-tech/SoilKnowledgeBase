The somewhat poorly drained Dusler soils are on slightly more convex positions and have a thin silty mantle 10 to 51 cm thick. The poorly drained Ellsburg, Hellwig and Melrude soils are on similar landscape positions. Ellsburg soils have a thin silty mantle 10 to 51 cm thick. Hellwig soils formed in 51 to 102 cm of sandy sediment over loamy till. Melrude soils formed in loamy sediments 152 or more cm thick."
