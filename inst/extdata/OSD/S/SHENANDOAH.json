  "OVERVIEW": "The Shenandoah series is a member of the fine, montmorillonitic, thermic family of Aquic Palexeralfs. Typically, Shenandoah soils have light brownish gray and pale brown, mottled, medium and very strongly acid, loam A horizons, and light brownish gray, mottled, medium acid, clay B2t horizons that grade to weathered granitic rock.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a paralithic contact of weathered granitic rock is 20 to 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 59 to 63F. The soils are saturated within 30 inches of the surface during the winter and early spring months, through lateral seepage and runoff from higher-lying soils. The water table drops rapidly during the late spring months and the soil is dry by early July and remains dry until October. Depth to mottles ranges from at the surface to a depth of 20 inches. The soil is slightly to very strongly acid throughout. The A horizon is light brownish gray, grayish brown, brown and pale brown in 10YR hue. Its brown or grayish brown colors, if present, are confined to the upper 6 inches or less. It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or loam. In some pedons an A2 horizon occurs in lower part of the A horizon. The B2t horizon is light brownish gray or grayish brown in 10YR or 2.5Y hue or light yellowish brown in 2.5Y hue. It is clay or heavy clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay. Its upper boundary is abrupt and the absolute clay increase is 20 to 30 percent. It has common to many mottles of olive brown, yellowish red, strong brown or yellowish brown in some or all parts."

In addition, Argonaut soils have hue of 5YR in the argillic horizon.  Auberry, Sesame, and Wisheylu soils have less than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Spreckels soils have a mean soil temperature of less than 59xF."

The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 40 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 60x F., mean July temperature about 77xF., mean January temperature about 40xF. The average frost-free season is about 200 to 260 days."
