Jefferson soils are on lower hillsides, are fine-loamy, have an argillic horizon, and formed in colluvium. Lily soils are usually on higher, broader, smoother plateaus, are fine-loamy, and have an argillic horizon. Ramsey soils are on adjacent ridgetops and lower positions on hillsides and are less than 20 inches deep to sandstone bedrock."
