Fragments, most commonly sandstone channers, range from 5 to 20 percent in the A horizon, 5 to 25 percent in the AB or BA horizons, 5 to 35 pecent in the Bw horizon, and 10 to 50 percent in horizons below the Bw. Reaction is extremely to strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam.\nThe AB or BA horizons (where present) have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sandy loam, loam, coarse sandy loam, and fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, and coarse sandy loam.\nThe BC horizon (where present) has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, and loamy sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sharpcrest soils formed in loamy residuum weathered from acid sandstone. These soils are on ridgetops, hillsides and less commonly on benches. Elevation ranges from 100 to 1600 feet above sea level. Slope gradients range from 8 to 90 percent but are dominantly 35 to 75 percent. Near the type location mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dekalb, Hazleton, Jefferson, Lily, and Ramsey series. Dekalb and Hazleton soils are on adjacent ridgetops and are loamy-skeletal. Jefferson soils are on lower hillsides, are fine-loamy, have an argillic horizon, and formed in colluvium. Lily soils are usually on higher, broader, smoother plateaus, are fine-loamy, and have an argillic horizon. Ramsey soils are on adjacent ridgetops and lower positions on hillsides and are less than 20 inches deep to sandstone bedrock."
