  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 59 inches. Depth to bedrock is from 20 to 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 5 to 50 percent in the mineral surface, 25 to 70 percent in the substratum, and 35 to 80 percent in the substratum, with greater than 35 percent weighted average between a depth of 10 and 40 inches. Rock fragments are dominantly sandstone and siltstone with smaller amounts of shale. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y and has value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is silt loam, loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Some pedons have a thin organic surface layer.\nThe BA horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and has value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is silt loam, loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse granular or subangular blocky.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 8. Texture is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe BC horizon, if present, has hue, value, and chroma similar to the Bw horizon. Texture in the fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam. Structure is weak fine to coarse subangular blocky or platy or is massive. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is sandy loam to silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Consistence is friable or very firm. Some pedons may have a 2Cr horizon above bedrock."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Berks, Blasdell, Brownstown, Brownsville, Cadosia, Calvin, Cloverlick, Deadline, Highsplint, Jubin, Judyville, Keyesville(T), Lippitt, Matewan, Manlius, Nailkeg, Peaks, Sylco, Warwick, and Wyoming series are in the same family. Berks and Brownstown soils have measurable amounts of kaolnite in the clay fraction. Blasdell, Cadosia, Jubin, Warwick, and Wyoming soils are very deep. Brownsville, Cloverlick, Highsplint, Judyville, and Matewan soils are formed in colluvium or residium derived from sandstone, shale, and/or siltstone bedrock. Calvin soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder throughout the soil. Deadline and Nailkeg soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from schist or phyllite rock types of the Colebrooke Schist Formation in Oregon. Keyesville (T) has more sand in the lower part of the solum. Lippitt soils are somewhat excessively drained soils derived from gneiss, schist, and granite. Manlius soils are only moderately deep soils that are formed over acid shale and can sometimes be excessively well drained. Peaks soils formed in residuum and have rock fragment dominated by granite, gneiss and shist. Sylco soils formed in residuum and have rock fragments dominated by phyllite and slate. Also Berks, Brownstown, Calvin, Cloverlick, Deadline, Highsplint, Jubin, Judyville, Keyesville(T), Matewan, Nailkeg, Peaks and Sylco soils are from outside LRR R.\nLordstown, Chadakoin, and Oquaga are similar soils in a related family. Lordstown and Chadakoin soils have a coarse-loamy particle size control section.   Oquaga soils do not allow 10YR and 2.5Y hues within the profile."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Solon soils are strongly sloping to very steep soils that typically occur on side slopes of ridges and valley sides. Slope ranges from 3 to 70 percent. They formed in till and colluvium derived from siltstone, sandstone, and some shale. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F, mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches, and the mean frost-free season ranges from 110 to 150 days. The elevation ranges from 860 feet to 1750 feet above sea level."
