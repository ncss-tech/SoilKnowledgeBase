Rock fragments are dominantly sandstone and siltstone with smaller amounts of shale. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y and has value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is silt loam, loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Some pedons have a thin organic surface layer.\nThe BA horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and has value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is silt loam, loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse granular or subangular blocky.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 8. Texture is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe BC horizon, if present, has hue, value, and chroma similar to the Bw horizon. Texture in the fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam.

Berks and Brownstown soils have measurable amounts of kaolnite in the clay fraction. Blasdell, Cadosia, Jubin, Warwick, and Wyoming soils are very deep. Brownsville, Cloverlick, Highsplint, Judyville, and Matewan soils are formed in colluvium or residium derived from sandstone, shale, and/or siltstone bedrock. Calvin soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder throughout the soil. Deadline and Nailkeg soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from schist or phyllite rock types of the Colebrooke Schist Formation in Oregon. Keyesville (T) has more sand in the lower part of the solum. Lippitt soils are somewhat excessively drained soils derived from gneiss, schist, and granite. Manlius soils are only moderately deep soils that are formed over acid shale and can sometimes be excessively well drained. Peaks soils formed in residuum and have rock fragment dominated by granite, gneiss and shist. Sylco soils formed in residuum and have rock fragments dominated by phyllite and slate. Also Berks, Brownstown, Calvin, Cloverlick, Deadline, Highsplint, Jubin, Judyville, Keyesville(T), Matewan, Nailkeg, Peaks and Sylco soils are from outside LRR R.\nLordstown, Chadakoin, and Oquaga are similar soils in a related family. Lordstown and Chadakoin soils have a coarse-loamy particle size control section.   Oquaga soils do not allow 10YR and 2.5Y hues within the profile."
