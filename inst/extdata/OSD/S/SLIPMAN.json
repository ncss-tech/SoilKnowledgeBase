    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 32 to 46 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature is 40 to 58 degrees F. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick. The solum is 30 to 60 inches thick. Depth to hard bedrock is 40 to 60 inches. Coarse sandstone fragments are 0 to 35 percent. These increase with increasing depth and exceed 15 percent in the lower part.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 through 3 dry and moist. It has crumb, granular or subangular blocky structure. This horizon is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist. It usually has platy structure but some pedons have granular or subangular blocky structure. This horizon is moderately acid through neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5 dry and moist. It is typically sandy clay loam but some pedons are sandy loam or loam. Clay averages 18 to 35 percent, silt 5 to 30 percent and sand 45 to 70 percent, with more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser. This horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline."

Anvik and Celaya soils have argillic horizons with less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand. Bear Basin and Monad soils have no bedrock above depth of 60 inches and have more than 40 percent rock fragments of rounded pebbles, cobbles and stones in the C horizon. Klutter soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Mayland soils have medium or strongly acid B2t horizons. McIntyre soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches and are very strongly or strongly acid in the A and B horizon. Paintrock soils have continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation. Quietus soils lack transitional AB horizons, have less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand, and formed in materials from limestone and dolomites."
