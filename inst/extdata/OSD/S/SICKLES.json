  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sickles soils are on lake plains and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The Sickles soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits overlying clayey till or lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 813 mm (30 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 8.9 degrees C (45 to 48 degrees F)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Sickles soils are associated in the landscape with Arkona, Kingsville, Lenawee, and Toledo soils. The somewhat poorly drained Arkona soils are in a drainage sequence with Sickles soils. Kingsville soils are sandy throughout. Lenawee and Toledo soils do not have the sandy horizons."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained or very poorly drained. Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between December and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very high in the upper sandy part and low in the lower clayey part. Permeability is rapid in the upper sandy part and very slow in the lower clayey part."
