  "REVDATE": "08/2012",
  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sickles series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits overlying clayey till or lacustrine deposits on lake plains and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 7.8 degrees C (46 degrees F).",

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained or very poorly drained. Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between December and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very high in the upper sandy part and low in the lower clayey part. Permeability is rapid in the upper sandy part and very slow in the lower clayey part."
