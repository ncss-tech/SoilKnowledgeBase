The soils formed in colluvium derived from schist or phyllite rock types of the Colebrooke Schist Formation.  Elevations are 2,500 to 4,500 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and warm moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 130 to 160 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.
