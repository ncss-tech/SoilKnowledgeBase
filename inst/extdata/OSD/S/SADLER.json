Depth to the fragipan ranges from 18 to 32 inches.  Fragments range from 0 to 30 percent in 2Btx horizon, and from 0 to 60 percent in the 2Bt and 2C horizons.  Soil reaction is strongly or very strongly acid throughout, except where limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe E part of the E/B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Redoximorphic features as clay depletions range from 1 to 20 mm in width and comprise 55 to 70 percent of the horizon.  Texture is silt or silt loam.  The B part of the E/B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Sadler soils have no competing series.  Soils in similar families are the Cambridge, Grenada, Lawrence, Nicholson, and Otwood series.  Cambridge, Lawrence, Nicholson, and Otwood soils lack an E/B horizon immediately above the fragipan.  In addition, the Cambridge soils lack an argillic horizon above the fragipan.  The Lawrence soils have redoximorphic features in chroma of 2 or less within the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  The Grenada soils are a thermic temperature regieme and formed in loess more than 48 inches thick."
