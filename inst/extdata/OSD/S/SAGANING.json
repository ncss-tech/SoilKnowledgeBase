  "OVERVIEW": "The Saganing series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in a thin layer of loamy material and the underlying sandy material on outwash plains and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
