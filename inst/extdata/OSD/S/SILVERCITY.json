  "OVERVIEW": "The Silvercity series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  They have extremely gravelly loamy sand at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  These soils are on stream terraces and dissected alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
