  "OVERVIEW": "The Spukwush series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and cinders overlying highly weathered tuffaceous material.  Spukwush soils are on mountainous slump area.  These soil are at elevations of 2,700 to 4,000 feet.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 70 to 100 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
