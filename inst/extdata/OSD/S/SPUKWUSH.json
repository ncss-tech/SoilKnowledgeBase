The lower part of the control section averages from 15 to 30 percent rock fragments and 18 to 27 percent clay.  The ashy layers are 14 to 24 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4 moist, 1 or 2 dry.\nThe Bs horizon has matrix colors that have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist or dry.  Some pedons have streaks and variegations with value up to 8 dry and chroma from 1 to 6 moist and dry.  It is loamy sand or sandy loam modified by 5 to 30 percent pumice and cinders.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in volcanic ash and cinders overlying weathered tuffaceous material.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 70 to 100 inches with most in the form of snow and rain during the winter months.  Mean January temperature is about 27 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 130 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 2 inches; a spodic horizon from 2 to 36 inches.  The soil is more than 60 percent volcanic ash and cinders from the mineral surface to 15 inches.  The spodic horizon is assumed not to meet chemical criteria for a spodic horizon but is assumed to have silt-sized and larger pellets and cracked coatings on sand grains.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
