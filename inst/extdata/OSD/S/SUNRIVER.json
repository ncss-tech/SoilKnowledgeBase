  "OVERVIEW": "The Sunriver series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on pumice mantled stream terraces.  They formed in reworked ash deposits over older alluvium.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
