Rock fragments range from 5 to 15 percent in the A horizon and from 15 to 45 percent in the BA horizon.  In the Bt horizon coarse fragments range from 35 to 60 percent and in the C horizon they range from 5 to 85 percent.  Rock fragments are 1 to 3 inch pebbles, dominate cobbles, and includes stones.  The solum is 26 to 38 inches thick.  The mollic epipedon ranges 16 to 24 inches thick.  Clay content in the particle size control section is 36 to 45 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loam, clay loam, and very cobbly clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is very cobbly clay, very gravelly clay loam, and very cobbly clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 4 to 6.  The texture is clay, extremely cobbly clay loam, and very cobbly clay loam."
