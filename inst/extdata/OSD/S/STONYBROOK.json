These soils are usually moist in the soil moisture control section and are dry 0 to 30 consecutive days in the summer; udic soil moisture regime.  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact has andic soil properties with an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention is 85 to 100 percent, 15-bar water retention of 15 to 30 percent for air dried samples, and 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It has 5 to 15 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3, 4 or 6 moist and 4 or 6 dry.  It is extremely cobbly medial sandy loam, extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, or extremely cobbly medial loam. Reaction is strongly or very strongly acid.  It has 1 to 7 percent organic matter."
