The soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. The solum is 14 to 35 inches thick. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Depth to a buried soil is 40 to over 60 inches. The particle-size control section averages 5 to 35 percent paragravel pumice fragments. Field estimated clay content is 0 to 5 percent. The solum has andic soil properties and contains 70 to 100 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate, phosphate retention of 25 to 50 percent, acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, 15 bar water content of 3 to 12 percent on both dried and undried samples and moist bulk density of 0.70 to 1.00 grams per cubic centimeter.\nSome pedons lack an O horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 through 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 1 through 3 dry. It is ashy loamy sand or ashy loamy coarse sand and has about 0 to 25 percent paragravel pumice fragments. It is soft and very friable or loose. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. Pumice fragments mostly have chroma of 4 through 8. It is ashy loamy coarse sand or ashy coarse sand and has 5 to 35 percent paragravel pumice fragments. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe BC and C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y value of 3 through 8 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 2 through 8 moist and 2 through 6 dry. The pumice fragments commonly have the higher chroma and value. It is ashy loamy coarse sand or ashy coarse sand and has 5 to 60 percent paragravel pumice fragments. It is moderately acid through slightly alkaline. Glass content is 70 to 100 percent.\nThe buried soil (2Bwb), when present, is at depths of 40 to 60 inches. It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is loam or sandy loam and may contain faint or common redox concentrations. It contains 0 to 50 percent rock fragments of which 0 to 20 percent are gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 25 percent stones.\nSome pedons have a BCd or Cd horizon.  These horizons are massive and are recognized as a dense layer but not densic materials or densic contact.  When present, the dense layers are typically at depths of 20 to 30 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Collier, Goffpeak, Kittleson, Sycan and Wocreek series. Kittleson soils have field estimated clay content of 10 to 18 percent clay, coarse fragments are rhyolite and glass content is 50 to 70 percent. Goffpeak soils have 35 to 75 percent pumice in the lower part of the particle-size control section and have acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of more than 2.0 percent. Sycan soils have redox concentrations below 40 inches. Collier soils are on ash flows and contain significant amounts of rock fragments consisting of cinders and andesite. Wocreek soils have 30 to 60 percent glass and have 1.0 to 2.0 acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus half the iron."
