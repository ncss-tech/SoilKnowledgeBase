    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Straddlebug soils are on broad alluvial flats and floodplains.  These soils formed in loamy alluvium derived mainly from tuffs of the Duff and Pruett Formations.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 15 inches, with most occurring in the summer months.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 62 to 68 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 210 to 260 days, and elevation is 3,500 to 5,000 feet."
