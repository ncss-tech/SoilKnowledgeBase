  "OVERVIEW": "The Straddlebug series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on broad alluvial flats and floodplains.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils formed in loamy alluvium derived mainly from tuffs of the Duff and Pruett Formations.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.",
