  "OVERVIEW": "The Santo Tomas series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in very gravelly sediments.  They formed on alluvial fans and colluvial slopes.  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",

The soils formed in very gravelly sediments derived from rocks such as rhyolite and andesite.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from about 58 percent to 66 percent F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 to 16 inches with a marked summer maximum.  Elevations range from 3,800 to 6,000.  The frost-free period is 160 to 200 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from 0 to 30 inches (A1, A2, A3, A4 horizons)\nPachic feature - The over thickened mollic epipedon with regular decreasing organic matter (16 to 30 inches)\nThe competing series section was updated to recognized Sanmoss and Enash series. These soils classify as pachic but they are series mapped in the Aridic ustic moisture regime.\nThis series represents an identified soil within the Desert Soil-Geomorphology Project, Las Cruces, New Mexico.  The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research."
