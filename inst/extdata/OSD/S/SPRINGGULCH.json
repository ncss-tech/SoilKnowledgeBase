  "OVERVIEW": "Springgulch series consists of very deep, well drained soils on southerly-facing mountain slopes.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from mica schist.  Slope ranges from 30 to 50 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 45 percent clay, and averages 15 to 30 percent rock fragments mostly pebbles.  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from early July to early October.  The soil temperature at 20 inches exceeds 41 degrees F from about February 15 to December 31 (255 days), and exceeds 47 degrees F from about March 15 to November 30.  Mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.  There is 15 to 25 percent mica minerals in the very fine sand fraction.  Base saturation (sum of cations) ranges from 70 to 85 percent in the argillic horizon, and is below 75 percent in some part of each pedon.  The ratio of extractable iron oxide plus gibbsite to clay is 0.2 to 0.3.\nThe A horizon is 2.5YR 5/4, 5YR 5/4 or 7.5YR 5/4.  Moist color is 2.5YR 3/4, 5YR4/4 or 7.5YR 4/4.  It is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon is 5YR 5/4, 5/6, 4/6, 2.5YR 4/6, 5/6, or 6/8.  Moist color is 2.5YR 3/6, 4/6, 5YR 4/6, or 5/6.  It is gravelly clay loam, clay loam, or gravelly clay.  The lower part is very gravelly clay loam or very gravelly clay.  The Bt horizon is neutral to moderately acid."

Lab results for measured clay are much lower than field estimates.  Field estimates are used with assumption that mica fragments were crushed during sample preparation, which influenced results.  Further investigation is needed.  Mica mineral content assumed from lab data from similar soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
