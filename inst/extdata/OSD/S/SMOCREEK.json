  "OVERVIEW": "The Smocreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  The Smocreek soils are on stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
