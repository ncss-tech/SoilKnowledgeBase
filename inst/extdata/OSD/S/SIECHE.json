  "OVERVIEW": "The Sieche series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in glacial till on steep or very steep uplands.  These soils have moderately slow permeability.  Slopes range from 6 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The solum and substratum contain from 2 to 10 percent coarse fragments as pebbles, cobbles, and stones.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 30 inches in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.5 or less.  It is loam or clay loam and slightly acid or neutral.\nThe B/E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  Few or common clean silt and sand grains coat surfaces of some peds.  Some pedons have a BE horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam or clay averaging between 35 and 50 percent clay.  It has weak prismatic structure that parts to moderate or strong, coarse or medium blocky.  Few or common clean sand grains form light gray or gray coatings on top of some peds or occur as small pockets in the upper 1 to 2 inches.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam or clay and slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It contains few to many, fine to coarse accumulations of carbonate.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Mottles in both Bk and C horizons are inherent to the parent material and vary widely in amount and intensity between pedons.  The C horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Burnel, Harmony, and LaPlatta series.  Burnel soils typically have an A horizon less than 9 inches thick and formed in alluvium.  Harmony soils have less sand and more silt and are formed in glaciolacustrine silts and clays.  LaPlatta soils are at elevations above 5000 feet and formed in weathered tuff, conglomerate, sandstone and limestone."

Slope gradients typically are 25 to 40 percent but range from 6 to 50 percent.   They formed in calcareous clay loam glacial till.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 48 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 24 inches."

Aastad and Buse soils do not have an argillic horizon and have less clay in the series control section.  In addition, Buse soils do not have a mollic epipedon.  Aastad soils are in swales and flats.  Buse soils are on similar landscapes as Sieche soils.  Forman soils are fine-loamy.  They are on adjacent less sloping prairie landscapes."
