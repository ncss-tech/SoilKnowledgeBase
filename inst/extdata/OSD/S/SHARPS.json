  "OVERVIEW": "The Sharps series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material derived from sandstone overlaying shale.  Sharps soils are on mesas, ridges, and hills. Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
