Seeg soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity within the series control section, have a mean annual soil temperature greater than 54 degrees F. and allow hue as red as 5YR or 2.5YR.   Utaline soils have greater than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are derived from basalt."
