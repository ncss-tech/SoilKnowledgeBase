  "OVERVIEW": "The Stent series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary rocks. Stent soils are on terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants or pediments.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
