  "REVDATE": "05/1999",
  "STATES": "CO,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sixmile series consists of moderately deep to shale, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from shale.  Sixmile soils are on hills and ridges.  Slopes are 10 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees.",
