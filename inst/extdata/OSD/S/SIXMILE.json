  "REVDATE": "05/2023",
  "STATES": "CO,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sixmile series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum derived from shale. Sixmile soils are on hills, pediments and homoclinal ridges of bedrock controlled landscapes.  Slopes range from 10 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 405 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
