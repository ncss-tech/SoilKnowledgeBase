Bjork, Dodes, Pahrange, Noslo, Shoebend, and Uhaldi soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Fernpoint and Orr soils have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Hullsgulch and Quailridge soils are moister during summer and fall and have sandy textures with lamellae below the argillic horizon.  Indiano, Madras, Quiero, and Simcoe soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Jerusalem soils have depth to the base of the argillic horizon of more than 150 cm.  Margerum soils contain 15 to 35 percent pumice pararock fragments, have a large component of volcanic ash, and have combined thickness of the A and Bt horizons of 100 to 132 cm.  Ralls soils have slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline A and Bt horizons and are dry in all parts for about 105 to 120 consecutive days in most years.  Truax soils average 20 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have Bq horizons.  Wenatchee soils have a component of loess and volcanic ash and very firm moist consistence in the argillic horizon."
