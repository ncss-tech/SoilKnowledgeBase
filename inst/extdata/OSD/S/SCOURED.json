  "REVDATE": "08/2009",
  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Scoured series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in tephra over colluvium and/or residuum from volcanic rocks. Scoured soils are on glacially scoured ridges and glacial headlands in the Southern Cascade mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 49 inches (1245 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F (5 degrees C).",
