  "OVERVIEW": "The Springwater series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from sandstone.  Springwater soils are on uplands and have slopes of 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The depth to soft fractured sandstone (paralithic contact) is 20 to 40 inches.  The base saturation is 60 to 75 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 moist, 3 or 4 moist dry.
