  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Weighted average clay content of the control section ranges from 35 to 45 percent.\nThe combined thickness of the A and E horizons is 5 to 12 inches.  The A and E horizons have hue of 10YR and 7.5YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is fine sandy loam or loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Surfaces of some peds have chroma of 2.  It has few to common brownish or reddish redox concentrations.  The texture is commonly clay but ranges to clay loam or sandy clay in the lower part of some pedons.  Electrical conductivity ranges from 0.5 to 4.0 mmhos/cm. The reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe BCt or B/C horizon has colors in shades of brown or gray.  Redox concentrations in shades of red or brown range from none to common.  The texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam with clay content of 25 to 40 percent.  Fragements of slightly weathered siltstone, sandstone or mudstone range from none to common.  Masses of barite range from none to about 3 percent.  Crystals of gypsum are in most pedons, but range from none to about 10 percent of some pedons.  Some pedons contain a few concretions of calcium carbonate. Electrical conductivity ranges from 0.5 to 4.0 mmhos/cm. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Cr horizon is weakly cemented tuffaceous sandstone, siltstone, or mudstone interbedded with clay loam or sandy clay loam.  Some pedons contain lenses or strata of weathered tuffaceous shale that has clay texture. Concretions of calcium carbonate range from none to few."

Arol soils have color values less than 3.5 in the Bt horizon.  Cadell, Chazos,    Gredge, and Payne soils have sola thicker than 40 inches.  Burlewash soils are well drained and ultic.  Lufkin, Mabank, and Zulch soils do not have a paralithic contact of soft bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Singleton soils are mainly on very gently sloping uplands with slopes of 1 to 3 percent.  However, the slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in tuffaceous sandstone, mudstone, and siltstone of the Jackson geologic group of Teritary age.  The climate is warm humid to warm subhumid.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F and mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 40 inches.  Frost free days range from 260 to 280 days and elevation ranges from 200 to 500 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 50 to 66."

Burlewash soils are above on low hills and sideslopes along drainageways.  Elmina and Gomery soils are on higher positions and have sandy surface horizons 20 to 40 inches thick.  Shiro soils are on similar positions.  They have sandy surface horizons 10 to 20 inches thick.  Tonkavar soils are above on slopes and ridges and have sandy surface horizons over 40 inches thick"

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are in native pasture or improved pasture.  A few areas are planted to small grain or ryegrass for winter pasture for cattle and/or deer.  Native vegetation overstory consists of post oak, blackjack oak, red cedar and elm.  The understory consists of yaupon, greenbriar, little bluestem, threeawn, paspalum sp., bristlegrass, purpletop, broomsedge, and panicum sp.  Pine trees have encroached in a few areas."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils do not have an aquic moisture regime.  Classification change from Aeric Albaqualfs is the result of interpretation that low chroma matrix is due, in part, to lithochromic influences.(6/90)  Field observations, landscape position and climate indicate the soil is not typically saturated for extended periods.  (5/93)\nThe Singleton soils have formerly been included in the Falba series\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 9 inches (A and E horizons)\nAbrupt textural change at 9 inches, from E to Bt horizon\nArgillic horizon - 9 to 38 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and BCt horizons)\nParalithic contact - at 38 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Data from soil samples run for Texas Municipal Power Agency local lab analysis\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
