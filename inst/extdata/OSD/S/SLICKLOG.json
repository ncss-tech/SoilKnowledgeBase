  "OVERVIEW": "The Slicklog series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains. They formed in volcanic ash and colluvium derived from argillite, shale, and conglomerate. Slopes are 15 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
