The acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron is 1.0 to 2.0 percent, volcanic glass content is 10 to 20 percent, and 15-bar water is less than 12 percent (air-dried sample). Base saturation is greater than 50 percent. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 35 inches. The particle-size control section averages 10 to 18 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry. The soil texture is ashy loam with 5 to 15 percent clay. The surface layer has 15 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles. The lower layer has 20 to 40 percent gravel and 10 to 20 percent cobbles. The soil reaction is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. The upper part of the Bw horizon is ashy loam or ashy sandy loam with 10 to 18 percent clay and 25 to 40 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobbles. The lower part is sandy loam or loamy sand with 5 to 15 percent clay and 15 to 25 percent gravel, 10 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 40 percent stones. It is slightly acid or neutral."

Leconte soils have an umbric epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick and a pscs dominated by 35 to 70 percent rock fragments of basalt origin.  Nicabeth soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact (basalt) and are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days. Tumac soils have a mollic epipedon of 10 to 15 inches thick and are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Slicklog soils are on back slopes, foot slopes and toeslopes of mountains. Elevations are 3,800 to 6,200 feet. Slopes are 15 to 90 percent. These soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium derived from argillite, shale, and conglomerate. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 35 inches. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 44 degrees F. The frost free period is 70 to 100 days."
