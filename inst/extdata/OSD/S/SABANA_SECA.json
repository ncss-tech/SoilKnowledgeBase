  "OVERVIEW": "The Sabana Seca series consists of deep, poorly drained soils formed in iron rich sediments.  They are gently sloping and sloping soils in the coastal plain.  These soils are clay, plastic in the A horizon, clay, plastic, gleyed in the upper B horizon and are plinthic, gleyed in the lower B horizon.",

Consistence is slightly sticky or sticky and plastic.  Reaction is very strongly or extremely acid in the whole profile.  Perdigons may or may not be present.  Clay films are few or very few and patchy in the B horizon.  Depth to water table ranges from 24 to 36 inches.  CEC per 100 grams of clay ranges from 16 to 22 mc.  Cation retention from NH4CC ranges from 9 to 12 mc.  The mean annual soil temperature is 76 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hues of 10YR and 2.5Y, values of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.  Structure is weak, fine or medium subangular blocky.\nThe B2g horizon has hues of 2.5Y and 5Y, values of 4 to 8, anc chromas of 1 and 2.  Yellow, brown, strong brown, dusky red and dark red mottles are present in varying proportions.  Low chromas occupies more than 60 percent of the matrix.  Structure is weak, medium or coarse prismatic.  Plinthite ranges from 15 to 30 percent in the lower B2g."
