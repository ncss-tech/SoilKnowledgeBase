  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS;  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to to 60 inches or more.  Depth to bedrock is more than 40 inches.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 2 to 35 percent in the A horizon, from 5 to 50 percent in the individual B horizons, and from 15 to 70 percent  in the 2B or C horizons.  Reaction of the unlimed soils is strongly acid to extremely acid.  Some pedons have A horizons that are medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y,  value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  A horizons 1 to 5 inches thick have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  E horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam,loam, or the channery, or gravelly analogues.\nSome pedons have a BA, BE or Bw horizon with hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2,5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture of the fine-earth is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown, and in the lower part, some pedons have mottles, redoximorphic, or relict redoximorphic features in shades of gray.  Texture of the fine-earth is silty clay loam, silt loam, or loam; however, loam texture is not permitted throughout the Bt horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6, and some have mottles, redoximorphic, or relict redoxicmorphic features in shades of brown, olive, or gray.  Texture of the fine-earth is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or loam.\nSome pedons have 2B or 2C horizons below 40 inches formed in residuum from shales or siltstone and are silty clay or clay in the fine-earth."

Albermarle soils contain 0 to 15 percent rock fragments in the solum, and these are meta- arkosic sandstone, graylacke, or quartzite.  Allegheny and Meadowville soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon.  Allenwood, Arendtsville, Aura, Bedington, Birdsboro, Butano, Chester, Chetwynd, Collington, Eubanks, Leck Kill, Shouns, Ungers, and Whiteford soils have hue redder than 7.5YR in some or all parts of the Bt horizon.  Arcola soils have weathered from Triassic and Jurassic red beds.  Bucks, Clymer, Edgemont, Edneytown, Elsinboro, Gilpin, Glenelg, Quakertown, and Syenite soils have sola less than 40 inches thick.  Chilmark soils have a sandy loam subhorizon in the Bt horizon and are underlain by glacial till.   Frankstown soils have rock fragments dominated by leached siliceous limestone or chert.  Freehold soils are very deep, contain glauconite, and are on coastal plains.  Murrill soils have a lithologic discontinuity within the solum.  Nixon soils have quartzite rock fragments. Pineville soils do not have silt loam or silty clay loam textures in the Bt horizon.  Rayne soils have argillic horizons that terminate at less than 40 inches.  Tate soils contain less than 30 percent silt in the control section.  Thurmont soils are very deep and contain rock fragments of quartzite, granite, or other crystalline rocks."
