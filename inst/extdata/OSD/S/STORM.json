  "OVERVIEW": "The Storm series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum, slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone, tuff, basalt, and breccia.  The Storm soils are on mesas, mountain slopes, and hills. Slopes range from 3 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F.",

The superactive CEC activity class is presumed for this series based on the general trend indicated by lab data throughout this region.  The range of colors in the E horizon includes both albic and non-albic colors; it has not yet been determined which is typical. The original concept of this series is in material derived from sandstone.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Series classified according to Eighth Edition, 1998"

Field study of several pedons determined that this soil should have an average clay content in the particle-size control section of 20 to 35 percent. There are many soft rock fragments that are ground up and turned into sand in preparing the sample."
