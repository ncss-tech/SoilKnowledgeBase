  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 2 to 13 inches (A and E horizons).\nCambic horizon:  The zone from 13 to 40 inches (Bw1, Bw2, and Bw3 horizons).\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 12 to 42 inches (part of the E, the Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, and part of the BC horizon).\nThe mottled colors are due to variation within the parent material.  The superactive CEC activity class is presumed for this series based on the general trend indicated by lab data throughout this region.  The range of colors in the E horizon includes both albic and non-albic colors; it has not yet been determined which is typical. The original concept of this series is in material derived from sandstone.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Series classified according to Eighth Edition, 1998\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This typical pedon was sampled by the National Soil Survey Lab,  Soil Survey Sample Number S86-CO-033-005. Field study of several pedons determined that this soil should have an average clay content in the particle-size control section of 20 to 35 percent. There are many soft rock fragments that are ground up and turned into sand in preparing the sample.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
