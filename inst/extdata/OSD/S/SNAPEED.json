  "OVERVIEW": "The Snapeed soil consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from quartz monzonite.  The Snapeed soils are on rock pediments.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
