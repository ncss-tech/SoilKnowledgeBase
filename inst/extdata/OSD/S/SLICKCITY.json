  "OVERVIEW": "The Slickcity series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fine-loamy alluvium over coarse gypseous lacustrine deposits. These nearly level soils are on alluvial flats on basin floors. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
