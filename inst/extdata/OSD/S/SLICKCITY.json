These soils formed from fine-loamy alluvium over coarse gypseous lacustrine deposits. Elevation ranges from 3,950 to 4,490 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September. The mean annual air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days."
