(Bt horizon)\nCalcic horizon:  The zone from 12 to 75 inches.  (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3, and Bk4 horizons)\nThe cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.\nTaxonomy version:  Eighth Edition, 1998.\nAdditional notes:  The seperation with Barx is vague.  Barx soils cover a broad range of elevations, temperatures, and precipitation.  Older versions of the osd have ppt at 16 inches.  Since ppt has been lowered, elevations likewise should be lowered.  At elevations of 4,400 feet in southeastern Utah, the maximum soil temperature ought to be the upper limit for the mesic temperature regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
