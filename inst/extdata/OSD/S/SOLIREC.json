  "OVERVIEW": "The Solirec series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over slope alluvium or colluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Solirec soils are on fan remnants, mesas, or hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

(Bt horizon)\nCalcic horizon:  The zone from 12 to 75 inches.  (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3, and Bk4 horizons)\nThe cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.\nTaxonomy version:  Eighth Edition, 1998.\nAdditional notes:  The seperation with Barx is vague.  Barx soils cover a broad range of elevations, temperatures, and precipitation.  Older versions of the osd have ppt at 16 inches.  Since ppt has been lowered, elevations likewise should be lowered.  At elevations of 4,400 feet in southeastern Utah, the maximum soil temperature ought to be the upper limit for the mesic temperature regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
