    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 53 to 56 degrees F.  Depth to rock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The soils are dry in all parts of the 5 to 18 inches moisture control section from June 1 to November 15, and moist in all parts from December 1 to April 15.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from March 1 to December 1, and exceeds 47 degrees F from April 15 to November 15. The thickness of the solum is 12 to 21 inches.  Depth to carbonates is 0 to 5 inches.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline throughout. The weighted average clay content of the control section is 30 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon is 2.5Y 7/2, or 6/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3 or 2.5Y 4/2.\nThe Bt horizon is 2.5Y 8/2, 7/4, 7/2, 6/4, 6/3, or 6/2.  Moist color is 2.5Y 5/4, 4/4 or 4/2.  It is clay with 40 to 45 percent clay.\nThe 2Btk horizon is 10YR 7/3 or 6/3.  Moist color is 10YR 4/3.  It is loam or clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay.\nThe 3C horizon is 10YR 7/2; 2.5Y 8/2, 7/4, 6/2 or 5Y 8/2.  Moist color is 10YR 5/3; 2.5Y 6/4, 5/4, 4/2, or 5Y 4/4.  It is silt loam, loam or sandy loam.  The 3Ck2 horizon may be modified by 20 to 40 perent gravel size soft siltstone rock fragments.

Abgese, Ackley, Greenbrae, Hardtrigger, Landbush, Morfitt, Paulville and Zane are all more than 60 inches deep and the depth to carbonates exceeds 13 inches.  Colbar soils have a lithic contact, no carbonates and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Harsan soils are more than 60 inches deep, have sola 22 to 36 inches thick, and have carbonates only below 34 inches. Sidlake soils have a lithic contact, are mildly alkaline in the subsoil and have no C horizons.  A description of the Eusbio series was not available."
