  "OVERVIEW": "The Stiles series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments from mixed rock sources.  Stiles soils are on uplifted lake terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

The soils are dry in all parts of the 5 to 18 inches moisture control section from June 1 to November 15, and moist in all parts from December 1 to April 15.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from March 1 to December 1, and exceeds 47 degrees F from April 15 to November 15. The thickness of the solum is 12 to 21 inches.  Depth to carbonates is 0 to 5 inches.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline throughout. The weighted average clay content of the control section is 30 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon is 2.5Y 7/2, or 6/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3 or 2.5Y 4/2.\nThe Bt horizon is 2.5Y 8/2, 7/4, 7/2, 6/4, 6/3, or 6/2.  Moist color is 2.5Y 5/4, 4/4 or 4/2.  It is clay with 40 to 45 percent clay.\nThe 2Btk horizon is 10YR 7/3 or 6/3.  Moist color is 10YR 4/3.  It is loam or clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay.\nThe 3C horizon is 10YR 7/2; 2.5Y 8/2, 7/4, 6/2 or 5Y 8/2.  Moist color is 10YR 5/3; 2.5Y 6/4, 5/4, 4/2, or 5Y 4/4.

Abgese, Ackley, Greenbrae, Hardtrigger, Landbush, Morfitt, Paulville and Zane are all more than 60 inches deep and the depth to carbonates exceeds 13 inches.  Colbar soils have a lithic contact, no carbonates and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Harsan soils are more than 60 inches deep, have sola 22 to 36 inches thick, and have carbonates only below 34 inches. Sidlake soils have a lithic contact, are mildly alkaline in the subsoil and have no C horizons.  A description of the Eusbio series was not available."
