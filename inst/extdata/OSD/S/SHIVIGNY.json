    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 56 degrees F. The soil is usually moist and is dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for less than 45 consecutive days in the four-month period following the summer solstice in most years. The thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock are commonly 5 feet or more but in some pedons the solum may be as thin as 40 inches. The pscs has  35 to 70 percent rock fragments and 35 to 70 percent clay. Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid with the pH decreasing with depth.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. Texture is very gravelly loam or very gravelly clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay. It has 25 to 60 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe AB or BA horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of  3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of  4 to 6 moist and dry.  Texture is very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly clay,  very gravelly clay loam, or very stony clay loam with  25 to 50 percent clay.\nThe Bt horizon and BCt horizon when present has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 to 8 moist and dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is clay, silty clay, or clay loam with 35 to 55 percent clay. It has 5 to 50 percent gravel, 0 to 40 percent cobbles, and 5 to 40 percent stones. Total rock fragment content is 35 to 70 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Shivigny soils are on old slumps benches, shoulder slopes, and back slopes of mountains. Elevations are 300 to 3,200 feet. Slopes are 3 to 90 percent. These soils have formed in clayey colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from basalt, tuffs, breccias, and andesites with some areas of metasedimentary or other igneous rock types. The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is typically 50 to 90 inches but may range to 110 inches in high winter rainfall interior mountains of southwestern Oregon. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 55 degrees F. The mean January temperature is about 37 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 63 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 220 days."
