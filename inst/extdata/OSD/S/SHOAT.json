Debenger and Springwater soils are moderately deep to\na paralithic contact.  Hohmann soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 53 to 57 degrees F, contain over 15 percent gravel throughout the profile and typically have hue of 5YR in some part\nof the solum.  Offenbacher soils lack the lithologic\ndiscontinuity, and lack the \"mollic\" colors (moist and dry) in\nthe A horizon."

This landscape consists of patterned ground with the Shoat soils being the mound component and the Randcore\nsoils being the intermound.  These soils formed in loess over\nbasalt.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free\nperiod is 100 to 150 days.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent."
