  "OVERVIEW": "The Stygee series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  Stygee soils are on alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
