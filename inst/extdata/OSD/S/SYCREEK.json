These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.  Thickness of the volcanic ash influence is 10 to 15 inches, and has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 55 percent rock fragments and 20 to 34 percent clay.  Depth to the 2CBd horizon is 35 to 45 inches.   Reaction is slightly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.\nThe AB horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is ashy loam or gravelly ashy loam.  It has 5 to 15 percent pebbles.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly sandy clay loam or very gravelly clay loam.

These soils formed in glacial till from sedimentary and some volcanic rock with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  Elevation ranges from 2,800 to 4,600 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 20 to 24 inches.  The mean January temperature is 23 degrees F, the mean July temperature is 65 degrees F, and the mean annual temperatures is 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
