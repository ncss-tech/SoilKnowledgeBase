  "OVERVIEW": "The Sycreek series consists of moderately deep to deep to densic material, well drained soils formed in glacial till from sedimentary and some volcanic rock with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  These soils are on mountain sideslopes and foot slopes.  Slopes are 5 to 35 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The particle-size control section averages 35 to 55 percent rock fragments and 20 to 34 percent clay.  Depth to the 2CBd horizon is 35 to 45 inches.   Reaction is slightly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.\nThe AB horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is ashy loam or gravelly ashy loam.  It has 5 to 15 percent pebbles.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.
