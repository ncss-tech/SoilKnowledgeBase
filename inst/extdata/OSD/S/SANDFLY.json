Under excellent water quality these soils support seagrass species including but not limited to widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima) and shoal grass (Halodule wrightii) due to their tolerances of low salinity and shallow water depths. Under degraded / poor water quality seagrass may be replaced by rooted eukaryotic macroalgae in the green (Chlorophyta), red (Rhodophyta), and brown (Phaeophyta) algae families. Caulerpa prolifera (Chlorophyta) is often dominant. Vegetative cover ranges from 0 through 20 percent."
