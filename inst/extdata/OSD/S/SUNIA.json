  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "MJM-JEC-JJJ",
  "REVDATE": "09/2001",
  "STATES": "WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sunia series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on outwash plains, stream terraces, and glaciofluvial fans and in outwash areas on moraines. They formed in loamy deposits underlain by sandy outwash. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy mantle and rapid in the sandy outwash. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (Unless otherwise stated, depth is measured from the top of the mineral soil.) The loamy mantle ranges from 9 to 11 inches thick. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the loamy mantle.  Volume of gravel ranges from 5 to 15 percent in the sandy outwash as a weighted average.   Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 3 percent throughout the pedon. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum and strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly acid in the substratum. Redox concentrations occur within 40 inches. Saturation occurs at 30 to 40 inches for 1 month or more per year in 6 or more out of 10 years.\nSome pedons have a thin O horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is partially decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4. It is loamy sand.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loamy sand, sand or coarse sand.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Typically, it is stratified gravelly sand to coarse sand."

Crex soils do not have a loamy mantle and have more than 50 percent fine sand in the particle size control section.  Mooers soils do not have a loamy mantle and have more than 50 percent fine and very fine sand in the lower part of the series control section. Pelkie soils do not have any gravel in the series control section, have an irregular decrease in organic carbon and occur on narrow floodplains along major streams. Tourtillotte soils do not have a loamy mantle, have loamy lacustrine sediments in the lower part of the series control section and have a perched watertable. Wurtsmith soils do not have a loamy mantle."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cromwell, Scott Lake, Wormet, and Wurtsmith soils. The somewhat excessively drained Cromwell soils and somewhat poorly drained Wormet soils form a drainage sequence with the Sunia soils. The moderately well drained Scott Lake soils are on nearby areas where the loamy mantle is 20 to 40 inches thick and a glossic horizon is present. The moderately well drained Wurtsmith soils are on nearby areas where the soil is sandy throughout."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are mostly in woodland. Timber stands are mostly red maple, northern red oak, eastern white pine, and quaking aspen with white oak, northern pin oak, sugar maple, American beech, American basswood, white ash, and paper birch as associates in most stands. Red pine and black cherry are associates in some stands. A few areas are cleared and used for cropland. Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay. A few areas are used for pastureland."

In some areas loamy mantle may range more than 11 inches thick.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon: ochric epipedon - 0 to 5 inches (A); oxyaquic feature - redox features and saturation within a depth of 40 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to soil survey number S98WI-078-942 for NSSL data on the typical pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
