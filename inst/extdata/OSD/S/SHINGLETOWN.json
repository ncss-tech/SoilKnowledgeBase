    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is 44 to 72 inches to the bottom of Bt horizon and mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 F to 54 F. The A horizon colors are very dark gray to grayish brown in 10YR and 2.5Y hues and have values of 3 to 5 dry and 2 to 3 moist.  Chromas are 1 to 3 moist or dry. Texture ranges from loam to silt loam that may be\nslightly gravelly. Structure is granular to massive and consistence is soft to slightly hard. Reaction is medium acid (pH 6.0) to mildly alkaline. The Bt horizons range in color from dark gray to very pale brown dry (10YR) and are about two units of value darker when moist.  Texture is heavy sandy clay loam to light clay and reaction is slightly acid to mildly alkaline. The All horizon is free of mottles but the lower horizons have distinct mottles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING: The Shingletown soils occur in gently sloping to nearly level mountain valleys under grasses, sedges and wiregrass. Underlying alluvium was derived mostly from basic volcanic rocks. The soils occur at elevations ranging from 1500 to 5500 feet in a humid mesothermal climate with mean annual rainfall of 40 to 50 inches, with warm dry summers and cold wet winters. Mean annual temperature is about 48 F, average January temperature about 32 F, and average July temperature about 64 F."
