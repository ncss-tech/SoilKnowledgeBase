  "OVERVIEW": "The Shortnap series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, somewhat poorly drained soils in drainageways.  These soils formed in alluvium from tephra over alluvium or residuum from basalt.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
