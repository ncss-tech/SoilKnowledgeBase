  "BYREV": "Rev. AJE/TAD/MJD",
  "REVDATE": "05/2004",
  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Shotwell series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum derived mainly from igneous rocks.  Shotwell soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  They contain more than 20 percent volcanic ash.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 51 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 65 to 67 degrees F.  These soils are usually dry but are continually moist in some part of the moisture control section for more than 1/4 of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  The soil moisture regime is Aridic bordering on Xeric.\nThe soil ranges from 10 to 20 inches deep over glassy volcanic bedrock.  Rock fragments are over 50 percent in the surface and less than 20 percent in the rest of the profile.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has weak thin platy or weak fine granular structure. It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bw or C horizons have value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  The Bw when present doesn't meet the definition of a cambic."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in a mantle of soil material less than 20 inches deep over ignimbrite, obsidian, and other glassy volcanic rocks.  The climate is semiarid.  Mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.   The mean summer temperature is 66 to 68 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches.  March, April, and May are the wettest months and June the driest.  Frost-free period is 105 to 150 days."
