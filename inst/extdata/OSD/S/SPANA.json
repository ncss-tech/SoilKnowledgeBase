    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Spana soils are in slightly concave depressions or troughs on glacial outwash terraces at elevations of about 30 to 150 meters. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in glacial outwash. They occur in a maritime climate with cool dry summers and mild wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 635 to 1,150 mm. The mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C., and the frost free period is about 165 days."
