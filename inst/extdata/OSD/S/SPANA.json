  "OVERVIEW": "The Spana series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in glacial outwash. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  They are in depressions or troughs on terraces. The mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm. The mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.",

These soils formed in glacial outwash. They occur in a maritime climate with cool dry summers and mild wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 635 to 1,150 mm. The mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C., and the frost free period is about 165 days."
