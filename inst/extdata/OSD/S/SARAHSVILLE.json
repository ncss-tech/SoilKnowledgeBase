It is neutral to strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon commonly has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 3 to 6, and mottles of both high and low chroma. Some pedons have chroma of 2 above a depth of 30 inches. The Bw horizon is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam. It is neutral to strongly acid.

All of these series except Zipp have an argillic horizon. In addition, Caneadea and Fulton soils have illitic clay mineralogy; Doles and Taggart soils are fine-silty, and Doles soils have a fragipan; McGary soils have thinner sola and have free carbonates in the C horizon; and Parsippany soils have varves or lamella in the series control section, and typically have low chroma in the upper part of the solum. Tygart soils have base saturation of less than 35 percent. Zipp soils have low chroma to a depth of more than 30 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sarahsville soils are on broad nearly level low terraces and flood plains that have a plane surface. The soils formed mainly in clayey lacustrine sediments or alluvium washed from upland soils having a high amount of reddish clayey residuum, locally known as redbeds. Slope gradients are 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 39 to 41 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from about 50 to 54 degrees F."

All of these soils except Licking, Newark, Nolin, and Vincent are on uplands and formed mainly in residuum weathered from bedrock or in colluvium. Licking and Vincent soils are on higher terraces. Newark and Nolin soils are on more narrow flood plains or are closer to streams and formed in silty alluvium."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Sarahsville soils were previously included with McGary or Tygart soils.\nClassification only was changed in 11/94, competing series and other changes will be made later.\nThe 01/2006 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). The CEC activity class placement is based on NASIS data elements for Guernsey and Noble Counties, Ohio, and not on laboratory data. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available. Additionally, data elements in NASIS indicate a Vertic subgroup.\nCompeting series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon)\nCambic horizon - 8 to 68 inches (Bw1 through Bw5 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to pedon NB-18 for laboratory charaterization data and engineering test data.\nPrevious revision dates: 11/94-DRM, DDW, RLC\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
