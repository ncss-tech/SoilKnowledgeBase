  "OVERVIEW": "The Southmount series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from basalt.  Southmount soils are on north and east-facing sideslopes and toeslopes of mountains.  Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 710 mm and average annual temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.",

Crystalbutte, Dehana, and Demast soils have more than 20 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Davtone soils have a mean summer soil temperature of 12.7 to 15.0 degrees C., lack O horizons and have hues of 5YR and redder in the Bt horizon.  Decross and Millerlake soils have Bk horizons.  Demast soils are more than 50 cm to the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Dranyon soils are well drained and lack mottles above 100 cm.  Gordo soils have hue redder than 7.5YR in the control section.
