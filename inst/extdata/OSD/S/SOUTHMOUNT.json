  "OVERVIEW": "The Southmount series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from basalt.  Southmount soils are on north and east-facing sideslopes and toeslopes of mountains.  Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 710 mm and average annual temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.",
