    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 48 inches, but the maximum depth to the lower limit of the argillic horizon is less than 40 inches.  Some pedons have up to 10 percent rounded pebbles or fine black concretions in the C horizon.  Soil reaction is strongly acid to extremely acid in unlimed areas.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 5 and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 10R, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is sandy clay loam, loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is fine sandy loam, fine loamy sand or fine sand.  A 2C horizon of red clay is below 60 inches in some areas."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Alonzville, Bailegap, Gunstock, Hambrook, Jefferson, Lily, Lonewood, Marr, Riney, and Sassafras soils are in the same family.  Alonzville soils have thicker sola and are in alluvium from sedimentary rocks on floodplains and stream terraces.  Bailegap soils have a Cr horizon and angular sandstone, siltstone, or shale fragments throughout the profile.  Gunstock and Lily soils have hard bedrock within 60 inches.  Jefferson soils have hues of 7.5YR or yellower and no rock fragments in the B horizon.  Lonewood soils have sola that are greater than 50 inches thick and silty B horizons.  Marr soils have Bt horizons with hue no redder than 5YR.  Riney soils have thicker sola and have formed in residuum from sandstone and shale.  Sassafras soils have 10YR to 5YR Bt horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sunnyside soils are on uplands in the northern part of the inner Atlantic Coastal Plain.  Slopes are complex and range from 0 to 50 percent.  The soil formed in unconsolidated sandy sediments of low to moderate clay content and low silt content.  The climate is humid temperate, mean annual temperature is 48 to 58 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 38 to 44 inches."
