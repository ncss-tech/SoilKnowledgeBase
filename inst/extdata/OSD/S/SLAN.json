  "OVERVIEW": "The Slan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium and/or slope alluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and conglomerate. The Slan soils are on terrace sideslopes, hillsides and mountainsides.  Slopes are 10 to 65 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
