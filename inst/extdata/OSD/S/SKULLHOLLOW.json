The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  The A and AB horizons have a phosphate retention of 15 to 25 percent, acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron of 0.4 to 0.8 percent and 15 to 30 percent glass.  Depth to the 2Bt horizon is 7 to 14 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 25 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.  The particle-size control section averages 30 to 35 percent clay.  Base saturation is over 75 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It contains 10 to 40 percent gravel, 15 to 50 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones.\nThe AB horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is ashy loam or ashy clay loam and contains 0 to 30 percent gravel,  20 to 50 percent cobbles and 20 to 30 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or clay and contains 35 to 75 percent gravel and 27 to 45 percent clay.  Clay texture occur in the horizon immediately above the bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Skullhollow soils are on north-facing slopes of mesas at elevations of 3,000 to 4,500 feet.  Slopes range from 12 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches, the mean annual temperature is 40 to 46 degrees F, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
