    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness ranges from 8 to 16 inches.  The control section contains more than 40 percent carbonates by weight. Gravel content for the surface layers ranges from 5 to 25 percent by volume and cobble and stone content ranges from 15 to 40 percent by volume.  The subsoil and substratum has 15 to 40 percent gravel by volume and 20 to 40 percent cobbles and stones by volume.\nSome pedons have Oe or Oa horizons 1 to 3 inches thick with neutral hues, value of 2 and chroma of 0.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral,value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 2. It is cobbly, gravelly, stony, very cobbly, very gravelly or very stony analogues of loam, fine sandy loam or silt loam. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A part of the A/B horizon has similar colors to the A horizon.  The B part has hue of 10YR, value and chroma of 3 or 4.  It has similar textures to that of the A horizon. Reaction of the A/B horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is very cobbly or very gravelly analogues of fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam or sandy loam. Reaction is moderately alkaline.\nThe Cd horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are very gravelly or very cobbly fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam or sandy loam. Reaction is moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the family.  Related soils are the Detour, Hessel, Johnswood, and Posen series.  These soils do not have carbonatic mineralogy.  In addition, Detour soils do not have mollic epipedons and are fine-loamy.  Hessel soils have lower chroma colors at depths of less than 20 inches and are coarse-loamy.  Johnswood soils have an argillic horizon and are well drained."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Alpena, Ensign, and Posen soils.  Alpena soils are sandy-skeletal deposits on ridges and side slopes.  Ensign soils are underlain by limestone bedrock at depths of 10 to 20 inches and are on similar landscape positions.  Posen soils are in the same drainage sequence on nearby uplands."

The depth to the water table ranges from .5 to 1.0 feet below the surface at some time during the period from October to May. Surface runoff is slow and permeability is very slow."
