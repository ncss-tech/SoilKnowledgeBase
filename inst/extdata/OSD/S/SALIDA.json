It is coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, coarse sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It lacks or has a small amount of free carbonates.  It is slightly acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe B horizon has value and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

The soils formed in sandy-skeletal outwash with or without a thin loamy mantle.  These sediments are Late Wisconsin in age.  Mean annual temperature is approximately 45 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is approximately 26 to 32 inches."
