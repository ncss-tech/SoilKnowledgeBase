  "OVERVIEW": "The Salida series consists of deep, excessively drained soils that formed in sandy-skeletal glacial outwash sediments with or without a thin loamy mantle.  These soils are on outwash plains, valley trains, and moraines.  They have very rapid permeability.  Their slopes range from 0 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The control section has 35 to 85 percent coarse fragments of mixed lithology.  It is mostly gravel and typically is 2 to 20 mm in size.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, coarse sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It lacks or has a small amount of free carbonates.  It is slightly acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe B horizon has value and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction. It is slightly acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is coarse sand or sand in the fine-earth fraction.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline."
