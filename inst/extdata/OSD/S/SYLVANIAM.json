  "OVERVIEW": "The Sylvaniam series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from dolomite, limestone and other highly calcareous sedimentary rocks.  Sylvaniam soils are on mountain sideslopes and ridges.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
