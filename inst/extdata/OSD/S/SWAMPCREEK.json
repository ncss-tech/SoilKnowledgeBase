  "OVERVIEW": "The Swampcreek series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources. These soils are on flood plains, drainageways, and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 406 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
