  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  Sweatbee soils are calcareous throughout with the depth to the calcic horizon ranging from 10 to 22 inches.  Calcium carbonate equivalent of the calcic horizon ranges from 5 to 40 percent.   The particle-size control section averages 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.  Individual horizons may have up to 45 percent rock fragments. The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F.  for 175 to 195 days.  The soil is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days during the 90 day period following the summer solstice.  The average annual soil temperature 47 to 51 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Total rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent gravel.Texture is sandy clay loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Textures are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, very-gravelly loamy sand, very-gravelly sandy loam and very-gravelly sand.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 40 percent.  Total rock fragments average from 15 to 35 percent in the particle size control section.  Total rock fragments average greater than 35 percent below the control section."
