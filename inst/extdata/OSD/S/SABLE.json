Chalmers soils have less than 20 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Chetomba, Drummer, Dunham, Elpaso, Elvira, Gillett Grove, Maxcreek, Maxfield, Maxmore, Pella, and Rushmore soils average more than 8 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Dolbee soils formed in alluvium and have a less systematic increase or decrease in silt- and clay-size particles with depth. Garwin soils are higher in total phosphorus and organic phosphorus, contain less clay films and dark coatings on faces of prisms in the lower part of the B horizons, are lower in iron oxides in the lower part of the B and C horizons, and contain more total clay sized particles to a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Hartsburg, Madelia, and Wacousta soils have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Marcus average more than 35 percent clay in the surface layer. Mascoutah and Patton soils have a mean annual soil temperature of more than 13.3 degrees C (56 degrees F). Ossian soils have lower clay content in the upper 76 to 122 cm (2 1/2 to 4 feet) of the sola, have a less pronounced structural development in the B horizon, and in general have a less systematic increase or decrease in silt- and clay-size particles in the sola."

Typically, they are on broad interstream divides of till plains, and less commonly on unglaciated hills and on terraces. Slope gradients range from 0 to 2 percent. Sable soils formed entirely in loess. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 12.2 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F)., mean annual precipitation ranges from 760 to 1020 mm (30 to 40 inches), frost free days range from 140 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 104 to 311 meters (340 to 1020 feet) above mean sea level."

The poorly drained Denny soils are in shallow closed depressions and have an albic horizon and an argillic horizon. Also, they contain more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. The somewhat poorly drained Ipava and Muscatune soils are commonly on narrow interstream divides, near the edges of broad divides, or on slightly higher or more sloping positions. The moderately well drained Osco soils and well drained Tama soils are on narrow or rounded crests and more sloping parts of the landscape."

In the few remaining undisturbed areas, the depth to an apparent seasonal high water table is 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 foot) below the surface at some time between November and June of most years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate."
