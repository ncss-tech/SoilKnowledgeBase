    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Hartz, Henshaw, Higdon, Lykens, Ogontz, and Travilah. Hartz and Henshaw soils do not have rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Higdon soils formed in colluvium and alluvium, and occur in MLRAs 116A and 116B. Lykens and Ogontz soils have sola less than 152 cm (60 inches) thick. Travilah soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sardinia soils are on terraces and valley trains that have a planar or convex surface. The terraces occur in streams valleys outside the Wisconsin glacial border, but which head in areas of Wisconsinan age glacial materials. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. The soils formed in as much as 61 cm (24 inches) of loess and the underlying stratified silty and loamy outwash or old alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1118 mm (36 to 44 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 56 degrees F)."

Cincinnati, Clermont, Rossmoyne, and Schaffer soils developed in loess-mantled Illinoian till and are on till plains. The somewhat poorly drained Fitchville soils have grayer subsoils and are on lower lying areas. The well drained Fox and Ockley soils are on lower terraces. The well drained Williamsburg soils have browner subsoils and are on higher or more sloping parts of the landscape."
