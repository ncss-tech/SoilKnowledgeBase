These soils are usually moist and are dry in the soil moisture control section 0 to 30 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Depth to basalt bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact has andic soil properties and 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.50 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 4 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100rcent and a 15-bar water retention of 15o 30 percent for air dried samples.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.  It has 2 to 5 cmol/kg of aluminum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 through 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry, chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 4 or 6 dry.  It has 5 to 15 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3, 4, or 6 moist and 4 or 6 dry.
