  "OVERVIEW": "The Sawpeak series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from marine basalt and associated volcanics on mountain slopes and glacial valleys.  Slopes are 5 to 100 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 105 inches and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.  It has 2 to 5 cmol/kg of aluminum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 through 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry, chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 4 or 6 dry.  It has 5 to 15 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3, 4, or 6 moist and 4 or 6 dry.
