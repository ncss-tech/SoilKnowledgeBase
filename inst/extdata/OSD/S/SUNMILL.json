Elevations range from 300 to 790 meters (984 to 2,590 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."

In addition, Joetree soils do not have a calcic horizon. Patscamp soils have an argillic horizon with a fine-loamy particle-size control section. Pearlspring soils have a calcic horizon but do not have an argillic horizon. Pintobasin soils are on alluvial fans, fan aprons and in drainageways, have sandy particle-size control sections and do not have an argillic or calcic horizon."
