  "OVERVIEW": "The Sunmill series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from granitoid rocks. Sunmill soils are on fan remnants and fan aprons over fan remnants. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).",
