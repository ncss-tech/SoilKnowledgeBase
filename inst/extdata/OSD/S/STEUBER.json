  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil between depths of 8 to 24 inches becomes moist in some or all parts in November and remains moist until late May. Mean annual soil temperature is about 59 degrees to 65 degrees F. Organic matter content is less than 1 percent throughout, and decreases irregularly with depth. Base saturation of the profile is more than 75 percent. The profile includes 0 to 25 percent gravel throughout.  Some pedons contain up to 20 percent cobbles and stones on the surface and throughout the profile. The soil is neutral to moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown, dark grayish brown, brown or dark brown (10YR 5/2, 4/2, 5/3, 4/3, 3/3). It is typically sandy loam but is gravelly sandy loam or light loam in some pedons.\nThe C horizon is grayish brown, brown, yellowish brown or dark brown (10YR 6/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 4/2, 4/3). It is typically sandy loam but ranges from gravelly coarse sandy loam to light loam and has 45 to 75 percent sand and 5 to 18 percent clay.  Some pedons ahve individual horizons with textures of loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, and sandy clay loam.  Some pedons may have up to 10 percent cobbles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Steuber soils are on alluvial fans and stream flood plains with gradients of O to 9 percent. They formed from mixed alluvium of primarily granitic origin. Elevations are 1,500 to 4,500 feet. The climate is subhumid mesothermal having warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 9 to 14 inches, some in the form of snow. Average January temperature is about 40 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 72 degrees F. Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees to 63 degrees F. Frost-free season is 150 to 225 days."
