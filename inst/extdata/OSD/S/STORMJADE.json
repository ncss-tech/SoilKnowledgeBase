  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Jadestorm (CA), Ramshead (NV) and Schenco (AZ) series. Jadestorm, Ramshead and Schenco soils are all moist in the moisture control section for 10 to 20 days cumulative following summer convection storms. Jadestorm soils also have a soil temperature of 22 to 25 degrees C. Ramshead soils are from sedimentary rocks and have flagstones and channers in the soil profile. Schenco soils are dominated by channers, formed in slope alluvium and have schist lithology."

Elevations range from 165 to 550 meters (about 540 to 1,800 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, dry winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (about 3 to 5 inches); mean annual air temperature is 23 to 27 degrees C (about 73 to 81 degrees F), and the frost-free season is 360 to 365 days."
