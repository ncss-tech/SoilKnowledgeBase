  "REVDATE": "12/2015",
  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Stormjade series consists of very shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium dominantly from granitoid. The Stormjade soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes range from 8 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (about 4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 25 degrees C (77 degrees F).",

Jadestorm, Ramshead and Schenco soils are all moist in the moisture control section for 10 to 20 days cumulative following summer convection storms. Jadestorm soils also have a soil temperature of 22 to 25 degrees C. Ramshead soils are from sedimentary rocks and have flagstones and channers in the soil profile. Schenco soils are dominated by channers, formed in slope alluvium and have schist lithology."
