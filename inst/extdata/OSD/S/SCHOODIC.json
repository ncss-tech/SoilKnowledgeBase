  "BYREV": "Rev.  GBJ-KJL-WDH",
  "REVDATE": "02/2000",
  "STATES": "ME",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Schoodic series consists of very shallow, excessively drained soils formed in a thin mantle of glacial till on ridges and mountains.  Permeability is rapid.  Slope ranges from 0 to 80 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 46 inches at the type location.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 1 to 12 inches but the thickness of the mineral portion of the solum is less than 10 inches.  The layer of mineral soil directly above the bedrock is 4 inches or more thick and is one third or more of the total soil thickness.  Rock fragments are more than 35 percent by volume and are mainly angular gravel and cobbles.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid throughout.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam with less than 45 percent silt in the fine-earth fraction.  It has weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular structure, or it is massive.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe bedrock is generally granite, gabbro, gneiss, diorite, phyllite, or schist."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Schoodic soils are on the crests and side slopes of bedrock-controlled ridges and mountains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 80 percent.  The soils formed in a thin mantle of glacial till derived mainly from granite and schist.  The climate is humid and cool temperate.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 48 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 46 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 5 to 2300 feet above mean sea level."

Vegetation also includes shrubs, ferns, sedges, mosses, and lichens.\nDISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT.  Mainly at the lower elevations of mountains and in coastal areas of eastern Maine (MLRAs 143 and 144B).  The series is of small extent."

A major inclusion in mapping will be soils that have a very thin spodic horizon.  3.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 12 inches (Oe and E horizons).\nb.  Lithic contact - bedrock at 12 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The Soil Interpretation Record number for the Schoodic series is:  ME0097.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
