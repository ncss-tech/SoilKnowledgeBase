    "content": "TYPICAL PEDON:  Swillna peat - on a 1 percent slope under black and white spruce forest with cottongrass tussucks at 2050 feet (625 meters) elevation.  (All colors are for moist soil).  This profile is separated into two parts the first part is in an intermound area between a frost boil; the second part is from within the mound or boil.  Mound-intermound topography consists of about 60 percent intermounds and 40 percent mounds.  One complete cycle of mound-intermound occurs about every 4 meters.\nPart I -- Sixty percent intermounds\nOi1--0 to 6 inches (0-15 cm); dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/6) peat; slightly decomposed eriophorum stems and root fibers; abrupt irregular boundary.  (5 to 8 inches thick)\nOi2--6 to 9 inches (15-23 cm); dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) peat; slightly decomposed eriophorum stems and root fibers; abrupt wavy boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)\nBg--9 to 18 inches (23-46 cm); dark gray (5Y 4/1) and 40 percent olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) silty clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.1); abrupt wavy boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)\nOib--18 to 21 inches (46-53 cm); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) and 20% dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/6) slightly decomposed fibrous eriophorum stems and roots; slightly acid (pH 6.1); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 4 inches thick)\nCf--21 to 40 inches (53-102 cm); dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silty clay loam; slightly acid (pH 6.2); frozen on August 12, 1994.\nPart II -- Fourty percent mounds\nOi--0 to 1 inch (0-3 cm); dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) peat; slightly decomposed eriophorum and ericaceous shrub stems and root fibers; abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 1 inch thick)\nAC--1 to 7 inches (3-18 cm); dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silty clay loam; strong coarse granular structure; friable, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine and fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (2 to 8 inches thick)\nC1--7 to 17 inches (18-41 cm); dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silty clay loam; strong fine subangular blocky structure; friable, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt irregular boundary.  (6 to 22 inches thick)\nC2--17 to 40 inches 94 (41- 102 cm); dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silty clay loam; massive; friable, very sticky and very plastic; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt irregular boundary.

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is less than 32 degrees F.  The mat of organic material is 0 to 4 inches thick in mounds and 8 to 14 inches thick in intermounds. Depth to permafrost ranges from 23 to 40 inches below the surface of the mineral soil in mounds and 18 to 33 inches in intermounds two months after the summer solstice. There is from 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser by weighted average in the particle size control section.  Textures include silt clay loam, silty clay, and silt loam. Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  The reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe A or AC horizon (when present) have moist hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; moist value of 3 or 4; and moist chroma of 1, 2, or 3.\nThe Bg horizon (when present) has moist hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, 5G, or 5GY; moist value of 4 or 5; moist chroma of 0, 1, or 2; redoximorphic features include redox concentrations with moist hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; moist chroma of 4 through 6.\nThe C horizons have moist hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; moist value of 4 or 5, and moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 5 percent with 0 to 5 percent cobble and 0 to 5 percent gravel.  A lag concentration of coarse fragments is common along the upper boundary of the horizon.\nOab, Oeb and Oib horizons are common in most pedons.\nIce content in the Cf horizon is variable and includes disseminated or segregated ice crystals, seams a few millimeters to several centimeters thick and massive ice features."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Swillna soils are in native vegetation of white spruce and black spruce forest with understories of eriophorum and ericaceous shrub in intermounds and exposed soil and ericaceous shrubs on mounds.  This soil is used primarily for wildlife habitat.  Soils are underlain by massive ice features and disturbance by fire or other activities may result in differential subsidence and mass wasting."
