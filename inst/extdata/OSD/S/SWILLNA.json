  "OVERVIEW": "The Swillna series consists of poorly and very poorly drained soils formed in a discontinuous organic mat overlying strongly cryoturbated silty lacustrine deposits. Permafrost occurs at a depth of 8 to 38 inches.  Swillna soils are on broad lacustrine terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is less than 32 degrees F.  The mat of organic material is 0 to 4 inches thick in mounds and 8 to 14 inches thick in intermounds. Depth to permafrost ranges from 23 to 40 inches below the surface of the mineral soil in mounds and 18 to 33 inches in intermounds two months after the summer solstice. There is from 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser by weighted average in the particle size control section.  Textures include silt clay loam, silty clay, and silt loam. Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  The reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe A or AC horizon (when present) have moist hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; moist value of 3 or 4; and moist chroma of 1, 2, or 3.\nThe Bg horizon (when present) has moist hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, 5G, or 5GY; moist value of 4 or 5; moist chroma of 0, 1, or 2; redoximorphic features include redox concentrations with moist hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; moist chroma of 4 through 6.\nThe C horizons have moist hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; moist value of 4 or 5, and moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 5 percent with 0 to 5 percent cobble and 0 to 5 percent gravel.  A lag concentration of coarse fragments is common along the upper boundary of the horizon.\nOab, Oeb and Oib horizons are common in most pedons.\nIce content in the Cf horizon is variable and includes disseminated or segregated ice crystals, seams a few millimeters to several centimeters thick and massive ice features."

This soil is used primarily for wildlife habitat.  Soils are underlain by massive ice features and disturbance by fire or other activities may result in differential subsidence and mass wasting."
