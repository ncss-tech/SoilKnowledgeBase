    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Spilock soils are on fan remnants.  They typically occur on backslopes.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone and conglomerate.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,620 to 1,770 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 230 to 280 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."

Gochea soils are very deep, and have moderately fine textured argillic horizons.  Kelk soils are very deep and do not have rock fragments in the particle-size control section."
