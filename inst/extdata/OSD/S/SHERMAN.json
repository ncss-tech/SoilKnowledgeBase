  "OVERVIEW": "The Sherman series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from granodiorite, granite, and schist. The Sherman soils are stream terraces and drainageways on mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1110 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
