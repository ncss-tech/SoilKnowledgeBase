  "OVERVIEW": "The Snakecreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy sediments derived from Holocene age alluvium. These nearly level soils are on drainageways. Slope ranges from 0 to 1. Mean annual temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (69 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1143 mm (45 in).",
