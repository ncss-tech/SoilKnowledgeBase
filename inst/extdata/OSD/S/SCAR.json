  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is less than 47 degrees F.These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between 8 and 24 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days in most years. The upper part of the particle-size control section contains more than 30 percent volcanic glass in the fine earth fraction. Content of coarse fragments in the upper part of the particle-size control section ranges from 0 to 20 percent and in the lower part from 5 to 35 percent.\nThe E horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chromas of l or 2 dry or moist. It is massive or single grain. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of l0YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chromas of 3 to 6 dry or moist. It is ashy sandy loam, ashy loamy fine sand, ashy loamy sand or ashy loamy coarse sand. It is gravelly in some pedons. It is single grain, massive, or has weak blocky structure. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid. The Bs horizon fails to be spodic materials because the pH is too high or the color too yellow or bright or both.\nThe C horizon has hue of l0YR, neutral or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chromas of l or 2 dry or moist. It is ashy fine sandy loam, ashy loamy sand or ashy loamy coarse sand and is gravelly in some pedons. It is massive or single grain.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, values of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist. It is loamy sand to sandy clay loam and is gravelly in some pedons. It contains l to 5 percent clay above 40 inches and l to 30 percent clay below 40 inches. It is massive or single grain. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral."

Scar soils occur in a cold subhumid climate with an average annual precipitation of 35 to 40 inches; mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.; and frost-free period is 70 to 90 days."

This change is based on Soil Taxonomy 2nd Ed. and the laboratory data on three pedons.  The moisture regime needs more study, the vegetation includes Engelmann spruce that normally grows in udic soils.\nPartial laboratory data are available on these soils.\nPedon number S68WA-019-001,  S68WA-019-002, and S68WA-019-003.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
