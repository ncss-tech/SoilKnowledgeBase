    "content": "REMARKS:  The series is mapped dominantly on slopes of 0 to 3 percent. During the update of MLRA 152B, soils correlated to the Spurger series in some initial soil surveys with slope more than 3 percent are correlated to the Buna series. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 23 to 73 cm (9 to 29 in) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in) (A and E horizon)\nArgillic horizon: 23 to 165 cm (9 to 65 in)  (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and 2BtC horizons)\nAquic conditions: 23 to 91 cm (9 to 36 in) from January to March for short periods\nAbrupt textural change: At the upper boundary of the E and Bt1 horizon.\nThe clay content decreases by 20 percent (relative) or more from the maximum within 150 cm (about 60 in) of the soil surface.\nAdditional Comments:  The series was reclassified in April 2000 to smectitic mineralogy to reflect laboratory data from Hardin County, Texas.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Data available from Texas A&M Soil Characterization Laboratory on sample S96TX-199-003 from Hardin County, Texas.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
