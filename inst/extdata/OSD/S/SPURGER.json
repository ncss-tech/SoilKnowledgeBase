  "STATES": "LA,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Spurger series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey and sandy alluvium.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on terraces of late Pleistocene age.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 20.0 degrees C (68 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1473 mm (58 in).",

During the update of MLRA 152B, soils correlated to the Spurger series in some initial soil surveys with slope more than 3 percent are correlated to the Buna series. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 23 to 73 cm (9 to 29 in) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in) (A and E horizon)\nArgillic horizon: 23 to 165 cm (9 to 65 in)  (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and 2BtC horizons)\nAquic conditions: 23 to 91 cm (9 to 36 in) from January to March for short periods\nAbrupt textural change: At the upper boundary of the E and Bt1 horizon.\nThe clay content decreases by 20 percent (relative) or more from the maximum within 150 cm (about 60 in) of the soil surface.\nAdditional Comments:  The series was reclassified in April 2000 to smectitic mineralogy to reflect laboratory data from Hardin County, Texas.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Data available from Texas A&M Soil Characterization Laboratory on sample S96TX-199-003 from Hardin County, Texas.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
