  "OVERVIEW": "The Simpark series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite, rhyolite, or quartzite.  Simpark soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
