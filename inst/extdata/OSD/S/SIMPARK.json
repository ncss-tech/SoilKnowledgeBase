These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite, rhyolite, and quartzite with a component of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,865 to 2,290 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
