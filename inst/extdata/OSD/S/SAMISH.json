    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 48 to 52 degrees F.  The upper 10 to 20 inches of the control section is greater than 40 percent by weight talc (serpentinitic family) but the weighted average is mixed mineralogy.  The series control section averages less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser and between 5 and 18 percent clay.  Reaction is medium acid or slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or neutral, value of 4 or 5 moist and dry, and chroma of 0 or 1 moist and dry.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y or 5GY or neutral; value of 4 through 7 moist and dry, and chroma of 0 or 1 moist and dry.  Most pedons have yellowish brown mottles.\nThe 2Cg horizon has colors like the Cg horizon and is stratified very fine sandy loam and silt loam with some  pedons having very thin strata of loamy fine sand and silty clay loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Samish soils are on flood plain terraces of narrow stream valleys at elevations of 45 to 400 feet.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from talc over mixed alluvium from adjacent mountain slopes.  Average annual precipitation is 35 to 60 inches.  Average January temperature is about 38 degrees F and average July temperature is about 62 degrees F.  Average frost-free season is 160 to 200 days."
