  "OVERVIEW": "The Samish series consists of somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium high in talc over older alluvium.   These soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 45 inches  and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The upper 10 to 20 inches of the control section is greater than 40 percent by weight talc (serpentinitic family) but the weighted average is mixed mineralogy.  The series control section averages less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser and between 5 and 18 percent clay.  Reaction is medium acid or slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or neutral, value of 4 or 5 moist and dry, and chroma of 0 or 1 moist and dry.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y or 5GY or neutral; value of 4 through 7 moist and dry, and chroma of 0 or 1 moist and dry.  Most pedons have yellowish brown mottles.\nThe 2Cg horizon has colors like the Cg horizon and is stratified very fine sandy loam and silt loam with some  pedons having very thin strata of loamy fine sand and silty clay loam."
