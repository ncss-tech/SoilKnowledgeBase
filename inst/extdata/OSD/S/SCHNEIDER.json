  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice in 7 years out of 10.  Depth to basalt bedrock is 40 to more than 60 inches.  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages 35 to 80 percent rock fragments, dominantly angular gravel.  Below 800 feet elevation, there are rounded glacial gravel in some pedons.  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has moist hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  This horizon is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 dry.  It is loam or silt loam, and is very gravelly, very cobbly, extremely cobbly, or extremely gravelly.  This horizon is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or silt loam and is very gravelly, very cobbly, extremely cobbly, or extremely gravelly.  This horizon is slightly acid or moderately acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Schneider soils are on foothills and mountains at elevations of 50 to 1,800 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 90 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium from basalt or andesite and volcanic ash, but are influenced by glacial drift below an elevation of 800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 75 inches with relatively cool, dry summers and mild, wet winters; mean January temperature is about 38 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 63 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 150 to 200 days."
