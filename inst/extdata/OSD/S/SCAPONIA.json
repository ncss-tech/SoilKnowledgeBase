It is 12 to 18 percent clay and 5 to 15 percent siltstone paragravel.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.

Bacona and Vernonia soils have an argillic horizon and are fine-silty.  Braun soils are 20 to 40 inches to weathered siltstone.  Glohm soils are moderately well drained and have a fragipan.  Hembre soils have an umbric epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick and are 40 to 60 inches deep to hard basalt bedrock.  Klickitat soils have an umbric epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick and contain more than 35 percent hard rock fragments in their sola.  Mayger soils are somewhat poorly drained and fine textured.  Tolany soils are medial and frigid."
