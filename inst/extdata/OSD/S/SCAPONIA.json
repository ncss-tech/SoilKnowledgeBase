The particle-size control section is silt loam or loam and is 18 to 27 percent clay, more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser, and more than 35 percent pararock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is 12 to 18 percent clay and 5 to 15 percent siltstone paragravel.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.

The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and warm moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 80 inches.  The mean January temperature is 35 to 37 degrees F, mean July temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 180 days."

Bacona and Vernonia soils have an argillic horizon and are fine-silty.  Braun soils are 20 to 40 inches to weathered siltstone.  Glohm soils are moderately well drained and have a fragipan.  Hembre soils have an umbric epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick and are 40 to 60 inches deep to hard basalt bedrock.  Klickitat soils have an umbric epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick and contain more than 35 percent hard rock fragments in their sola.  Mayger soils are somewhat poorly drained and fine textured.  Tolany soils are medial and frigid."
