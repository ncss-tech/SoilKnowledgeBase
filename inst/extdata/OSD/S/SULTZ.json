  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the sandy mantle and depth to the stratified substratum ranges from 102 to 152 centimeters. Volume of rock fragments averages less than 15 percent throughout the pedon. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent and volume of cobble ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout. Reaction in the upper part of the solum naturally ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid but ranges to neutral in the A and E horizons, where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part of the subsoil and from strongly acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe O horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, or is neutral in hue. Value is 2 to 3; and chroma is 0 to 3. The O horizon is a mat of partially decomposed forest litter.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 2 to 4; and chroma of 1 or 2. Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 or 3. The A or Ap horizon is fine sand, sand, or loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. The E horizon is fine sand, sand, or loamy sand.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4. It is typically fine sand, sand, or loamy sand, but is loamy fine sand in some pedons. Volume of ortstein ranges from 0 to 50 percent.\nThe BC or Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 4 to 6. It is typically sand but is fine sand in some pedons. BC or Bw horizons with spodic color have pH greater than 5.9 or organic carbon content less than 0.6 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6. It is typically sand but is fine sand in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6. It is stratified loamy, or loamy and sandy, layers. Individual strata are silty clay loam, silt loam, clay loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, very fine sand, fine sand, or sand."

None of these soils have stratified loamy, or loamy and sandy, strata in the lower part of the series control section. In addition, Duel and Ishpeming soils have a lithic contact at 51 to 102 centimeters. East Lake and Hartwick soils have free carbonates within 102 centimeters. Karlin soils have sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy fine sand mantle in the upper part of the series control section. Kiva soils have a 25 to 51 centimeter loamy mantle and free carbonates within 102 centimeters. Missisquoi soils have more than 15 percent coarse fragments in the lower part of the control section. Pence soils have a loamy mantle 25 to 51 centimeters thick and have more than 15 percent gravel in the lower part of the control section. Sayner soils have 15 to 35 percent gravel in at least the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sultz soils are on outwash plains, lake plains, outwash terraces, lake terraces, and, to a lesser extent, on old beach ridges. Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent. These soils formed in deep sandy outwash underlain by stratified loamy, or loamy and sandy, alluvium or lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 710 to 840 millimeters. Mean annual temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C. The frost free period ranges from about 90 to 135 days. Elevation ranges from 213 to 594 meters."

Common trees are red pine, eastern white pine, jack pine, paper birch, sugar maple, red maple, basswood, quaking aspen, big-toothed aspen, northern pin oak, northern red oak, and eastern hemlock. Common understory species are American hazel, blueberry, bracken fern, bigleaf aster, partridgeberry, and club moss. A few areas are used for cropland or pastureland. Oats, bromegrass, timothy, alfalfa, and red clover are the principle crops."
