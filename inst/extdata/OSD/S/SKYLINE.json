    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  In most years the soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for more than 90 consecutive days during the 4 months following the summer solstice.  They are moist throughout the moisture control section for 90 days or more following the winter solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to about 54 degrees F.  Thickness of solum and depth to the paralithic contact range from 12 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments (2 mm. to 10 inches in diameter) range from 20 to 55 percent in the A horizons and 10 to 30 percent in the B horizons and average 20 to 35 percent in the control section.  Amount of surface stones ranges from 5 to 20 percent.  The control section is loam and has 12 to 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5.5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist dry.  It has weak or moderate structure."

Kuhl and Stukel soils have lithic contacts.  Tollhouse soils are coarse sandy loam or sandy loam and have 20 to 50 percent coarse sand or very coarse sand."

The soils formed in mixed loess and volcanic ash and colluvium over partially weathered sedimentary bedrock.  The climate is semiarid with moist winters and dry summers.  The mean annual temperature is about 45 to 52 degrees F., the mean January temperature is about 32 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches.  The frost-free (32 degrees F.) season is 110 to 140 days and for (28 degrees F.) is 140 to 160 days."
