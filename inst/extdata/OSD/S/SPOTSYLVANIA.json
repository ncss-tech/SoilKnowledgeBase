    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 100 to more than 150 cm.  Depth to the lithologic discontinuity ranges from 50 to 100 cm.  Depth to hard bedrock is more than 180 cm.  Reaction is strongly or very strongly acid unless limed.  The upper material contains up to 15 percent of rounded and sub- rounded quartz pebbles and the II material contains up to 15 percent of angular feldspar fragments and some pedons contain a few angular quartz fragments.  Stone lines commonly are present at the contact between the B2 and IIB2 horizons.\nA1 horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 through 4.  A2 horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  Ap horizons, when present, have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Textures of A horizons are fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.\nB1 and B2 horizons have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Textures of the B1 horizons are clay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam and the B2 horizons are clay loam or clay.  IIB horizons have hue of 5YR, 715YR or 20YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8 and commonly contain high chroma mottles.  Textures of the IIB horizons are clay loam or clay. Flakes of mica are few many in the IIB horizons.\nC horizons are multicolored and commonly are in shades of red, brown, yellow, and white.  They are very strongly weathered gneiss, schist, and granite that easily crush to sandy clay lom, loam, or sandy loam textures."

All of these soils lack a lithologic discontinuity.  The Christian, Culpeper, and Lodi series are in closely related families.  All of these lack a lithologic discontinuity.  In addition, the Christian, Culpeper, and Lodi soils are mesic."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Spotsylvania soils are on nearly level to moderately steep uplands.  Slopes are dominantly 2 to 7 percent but range from 0 to 25 percent.  The upper solum formed in loamy or clayey sediments often of Coastal Plain origin, and the lower solum formed in material that weathered from granite, gneiss, and schist.  The climate is humid with mean annual precipitation of about 107 cm and a mean annual temperature above 15 degrees C."
