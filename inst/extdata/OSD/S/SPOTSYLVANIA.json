  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Spotsylvania series are deep and well drained with moderate permeability.  They formed in medium and fine textured Coastal Plain sediments and residuum from granite, gneiss or schist.  They are on uplands and slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 107 cm and mean annual air temperature is above 15 degrees C.",

Depth to hard bedrock is more than 180 cm.  Reaction is strongly or very strongly acid unless limed.  The upper material contains up to 15 percent of rounded and sub- rounded quartz pebbles and the II material contains up to 15 percent of angular feldspar fragments and some pedons contain a few angular quartz fragments.  Stone lines commonly are present at the contact between the B2 and IIB2 horizons.\nA horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 through 4.  E horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  Ap horizons, when present, have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Textures of A and E horizons are fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.\nBt1 and Bt2 horizons have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Textures of the Bt1 horizons are clay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam and the Bt2 horizons are clay loam or clay.  2Bt horizons have hue of 5YR, 715YR or 20YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8 and commonly contain high chroma mottles.  Textures of the 2Bt horizons are clay loam or clay. Flakes of mica are few many in the IIB horizons.\nC horizons are multicolored and commonly are in shades of red, brown, yellow, and white.  They are very strongly weathered gneiss, schist, and granite that easily crush to sandy clay lom, loam, or sandy loam textures."
