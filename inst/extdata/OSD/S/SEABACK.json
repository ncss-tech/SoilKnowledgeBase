  "OVERVIEW": "The Seaback series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in material weathered from soft calcareous sandstone, shale or conglomerate. Seaback soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 9 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 254 millimeters (10 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).",
