  "OVERVIEW": "The Sarcoxie series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, soils that formed in loess over reworked loess and/or till. Sarcoxie soils are on summits and shoulders of uplands.  Slopes range from 1 to 7 percent slopes. Mean annual precipitation is about 86 centimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C..",
