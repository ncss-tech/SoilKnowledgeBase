The average annual soil temperature ranges from 4l to 46 F.  These soils are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The control section averages 5 to l8 percent clay and has 35 to 80 percent coarse fragments.  Depth to bedrock is more than 40 inches.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of l through 4 dry, 3 or 4 moist.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Scotties soils are on mountain sides that generally have a northerly aspect.  Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived primarily from sandstone of the Swauk Formation with a thin mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  Elevations are 2,000 to 4,800 feet.  These soils are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters with a snowpack from about December through March. The average annual precipitation is 22 to 40 inches.  The average January temperature is about 23 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 66 degrees F.; and the average annual air temperature is 4l to 44 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F.) is l40 to l65 days."
