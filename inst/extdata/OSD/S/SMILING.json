The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F. Depth to bedrock is 40 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to the buried argillic horizon and ash mantle thickness is 14 to 33 inches.  The ash mantle contains 50 to 70 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate, phosphate retention of 60 to 80 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water content of 5 to 10 percent on dried samples and 8 to 12 percent on undried samples.  The soil is moderately acid to neutral throughout.\nThe Oi horizon is 1 to 3 inches thick except where disturbed.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It contains 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Total rock fragments are 0 to 15 percent.  It contains 5 to 15 percent field estimated clay.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon, which is in the ash mantle.\nThe 2Btb and 3Btb horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 3 through 6 dry.  It is loam, clay loam, gravelly loam, or gravelly clay loam.  It contains 18 to 35 percent field estimated clay.  It contains 5 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones.  Total rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent."
