  "OVERVIEW": "The Swala series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in loess influenced residuum from travertine. Swala soils are found on slopes of 2 to 40 percent on travertine terraces. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.",
