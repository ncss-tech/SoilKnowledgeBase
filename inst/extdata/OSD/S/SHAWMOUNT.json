  "OVERVIEW": "The Shawmount series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderate permeability that formed in alluvium and colluvium from igneous rocks. Slopes range from 1 to 65 percent in foothills and valleys. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
