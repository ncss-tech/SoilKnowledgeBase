Ashue soils have extremely gravelly or extremely cobbly sand textures in the 2C horizon at depths greater than 30 inches and do not have lamellae below the argillic horizon. Badena soils are 20 to 36 inches to sandy-skeletal material, have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 50 degrees F. and Bt horizons that are strongly alkaline with over 60 percent rock fragments. Badenaugh and Leviathan soils have Bt horizons extending to depths of greater than 60 inches. Eaglerock, Gitabyte, Grinrod, Ister, Searles, Searvar and Trid soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to lithic or paralithic contact. Nosrac soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 50 degrees F., Bt horizons that have less than 45 percent sand with a base greater than 50 inches deep and lack lamellae below the argillic horizon. Oest soils do not have lamellae below the argillic horizon. Lemm soils have less than 18 percent clay in the Bt horizon. Shree soils do not have lamellae below the argillic horizon. Shroe soils have 35 to 45 percent clay in the upper Bt horizon, have 2C horizons of lacustrine sediment origin, and do not have lamellae below the argillic horizon. Tristan soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Shawmount soils are nearly level to very steep on flood-plain steps, stream terraces, relict lakebed escarpments and eroded fan remnants at elevations of 2,500 to 4,000 feet. Slopes range from 1 to 65 percent. These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from igneous rocks (dominantly granitic). Average annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 16 inches. Average annual temperature ranges from 48 to 51 degrees F. Frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."
