  "OVERVIEW": "The Sunroad series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over alluvium or outwash derived from metasedimentary rock.  These soils occur on alluvial fans and outwash terraces. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1,000 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 5.0 degrees C.",
