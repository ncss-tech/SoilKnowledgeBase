    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 64 degrees F.  The soils range from moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline in a majority of subhorizons within the solum.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 15 to 60 percent in a major part of the Btn horizon, but is less than 15 percent in the A horizon in some pedons.  Conductivity ranges from 0 to 14 millimhos within the epipedon and the natric horizon.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material normally ranges from 0 to 6 inches.  Depth to the coarse textured 2C horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the natric horizon ranges from 10 to 26 inches.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate or other soluble salt accumulation ranges from 10 to 40 inches.  Clay content of the major part of any horizons occurring above the contrasting sandy or sandy-skeletal substratum ranges from 18 to 35 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in a major part of the solum and range from 1 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon is absent in some pedons.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bkz horizon or C (if present) has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3."

The average annual precipitation is 7 to 9 inches, with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual temperature is 40 degrees to 44 degrees F., and mean summer temperature is 59 degrees  to 62 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from 7,000 to 8,000 feet.
