These soils formed in eolian deposits and material weathered from sandstone. The climate is semiarid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 14 inches. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F. and the freeze-free period ranges from 110 to 165 days."
