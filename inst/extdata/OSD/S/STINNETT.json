  "OVERVIEW": "The Stinnett series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils which are deep to a densic contact.  These soils formed in loess or silty alluvium over loamy alluvium underlain by dense sandy or loamy lodgement till on disintegration moraines. Permeability is moderate in the silty mantle, moderately slow in the loamy alluvium, and slow in the dense till. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 12 to 36 inches. Depth to the densic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Content of clay averages from 7 to 17 percent in the particle-size control section and the content of sand coarser than very fine averages 15 to 70 percent. Coarse fragments are dominantly of igneous origin and are of mixed lithology. Total volume of rock fragment ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the silty mantle, 0 to 25 percent in the loamy alluvium, and 5 to 35 percent in the dense till. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the silty mantle, from 0 to 20 percent in the loamy alluvium, and from 5 to 35 percent in the dense till. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 3 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 5 percent in the loamy alluvium and in the dense till. Volume of stones ranges from 0 to 1 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 3 percent in the loamy alluvium and in the dense till. Surface stones have coverage ranging from 0 to 3 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the silty mantle, but ranges to neutral where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the loamy alluvium and from strongly acid to neutral in the dense till. Masses of iron accumulations are within 20 inches of the mineral soil surface. Iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less are in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.
