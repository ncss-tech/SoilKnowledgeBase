    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 12 to 36 inches. Depth to the densic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Content of clay averages from 7 to 17 percent in the particle-size control section and the content of sand coarser than very fine averages 15 to 70 percent. Coarse fragments are dominantly of igneous origin and are of mixed lithology. Total volume of rock fragment ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the silty mantle, 0 to 25 percent in the loamy alluvium, and 5 to 35 percent in the dense till. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the silty mantle, from 0 to 20 percent in the loamy alluvium, and from 5 to 35 percent in the dense till. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 3 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 5 percent in the loamy alluvium and in the dense till. Volume of stones ranges from 0 to 1 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 3 percent in the loamy alluvium and in the dense till. Surface stones have coverage ranging from 0 to 3 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the silty mantle, but ranges to neutral where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the loamy alluvium and from strongly acid to neutral in the dense till. Masses of iron accumulations are within 20 inches of the mineral soil surface. Iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less are in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon. Aquic conditions occur within 20 inches at some time in normal years.\nA horizon\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 2 or 3\nChroma: 1 to 2\nTexture: silt loam.\nSome pedons have an Ap horizon\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 3 or 4\nChroma: 2 or 3\nTexture: silt loam.\nE horizon\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 4 to 6\nChroma: 1 to 3\n(Colors of 4/3, 5/3, or 6/3 have dry value of 7 or more)\nTexture: silt or silt loam.\nStinnett soils have a glossic horizon.  Horizonation has a wide range depending on the thickness of the silty mantle and degree to which eluviation has occurred.  Therefore, there can be E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons singularly or in combination.\nThe E part of the E/B or B/E horizon, has color and texture like the E horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is silt loam.\nSome pedons have a Bt horizon with color and texture like the Bt part described above. Clay content ranges from 8 to 17 percent.\nThe 2E part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizon, has color like the E horizon described above. Texture is loam, sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs. The 2Bt part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs.

Permeability is moderate in the silty mantle, moderately slow in the loamy alluvium, and slow in the dense till.
