  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages about 7 percent coarse fragments and ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  The clay content in the control section ranges from 18 to 35 percent and sand content ranges from 15 to 30 percent.  The coarse fragments are dominantly gravel, but a few cobbles are present in most pedons.  In some pedons soil fragments and isolated peds of relict genetic horizons of pre-mined soils are randomly distributed throughout, and are disordered relative to any plane in the profile.  Some of the soil fragments have identifiable properties such as mottles, clay films, or coatings that are characteristic of their previous formation.  The organic carbon content decreases irregularly with depth in most pedons because of mixing (and because of the presence of flakes and fragments of coal or other carbonaceous material).  Some pedons contain one or more layers that were compressed during placement and grading of the soil material.  These layers have high bulk density and low available water capacity, and impede movement of roots and water.  Depth to bedrock is more than 5 feet.\nThe upper part of the series control section (A horizon) has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma dominantly of 3 or 4 but ranging from 1 through 6.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or loam.\nSome pedons do not have the AC horizon.\nThe individual layers within the lower part of the series control section (C horizons) are variable in number and thickness.  To a depth of 48 inches or more, the C horizon typically has hue of 10YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 to 6.  It is loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. Below a depth of 48 inches the C horizon has a wide range of colors, and colors are mixed.  It is clay loam, loam, silty clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay, or the gravelly or channery analogs.  Some pedons contain stones below a depth of 48 inches and they occur at random depth, spacing, and orientation.  Some pedons contain strata, pockets, or soil fragments below a depth of 48 inches that do not contain free carbonates."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Schuline soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping summits and back slopes of reconstructed landscapes.  Slope gradients commonly are 1 to 10 percent, but range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in materials that were excavated and reclaimed during surface mining operations.  The upper 48 inches of the regolith is dominantly fine-earth material, with a few coarse fragments.  Most areas have been covered with the surface layer of pre-mined soils.  At depths greater than 48 inches the regolith is fine-earth material or a mixture of unconsolidated fine-earth material and rock fragments.  The fine-earth material is dominated by calcareous loamy material that was glacial till before it was mined and contains components that, before mining, were loess or residuum weathered from interbedded siltstone, sandstone, shale, or limestone.  Mean annual temperature varies from 53 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation varies from 36 to 44 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Lenzburg and Swanwick soils on surface mined areas, and the Ava, Darmstadt, Hosmer, Hoyleton, and Wakeland soils on adjacent unmined landscapes.  Lenzburg soils are nearby; graded areas are on similar parts of the landscape, and ungraded areas are on steeper side slopes or parallel ridges.  Swanwick soils are nearby on similar parts of the landscape.  Ava, Darmstadt, Hosmer, and Hoyleton soils all have argillic horizons.  In addition, Ava and Hosmer soils have Bx horizons, Darmstadt soils have natric horizons, and Hoyleton soils have color value of 3 or darker in the surface layer.  The somewhat poorly drained Wakeland soils are coarse-silty and formed in alluvium on bottomlands."
