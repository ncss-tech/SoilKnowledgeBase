These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sedimentary rocks such as sandstone or volcanic rocks such as rhyolite.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,955 to 2,810 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 380 mm, mean annual temperature is 2 to 4 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."
