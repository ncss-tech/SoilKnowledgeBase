  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, depth is measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 35 to more than 80 inches.  The weighted average clay content ranges from 5 to 17 percent and the weighted average content of fine sand or coarser ranges from 45 to 70 percent in the particle-size control section.  Rock fragments are dominantly of igneous or metamorphic origin and are of mixed lithology.  Total volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent in the series control section.  Volume of gravel ranges from 1 to 35 percent.  Volume of cobbles and volume of stones range from 0 to 10 percent throughout the pedon.  Stones are on the surface in some places and stony and very stony phases are recognized.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum but ranges to neutral in an Ap horizon where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum.\nThe O horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 3.  The O horizon is a mat of partially decomposed forest litter.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 to 3; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated areas have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture of the A or Ap horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand.\nSome pedons have a Bhs horizon less than 3 inches thick, with hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  Typically, texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs but in some pedons it is loam or gravelly loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.  It has texture like the Bhs horizon described above.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon with hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or the gravelly analogs.\nSarona soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both)  The E part has color and texture like the E' horizon above.  The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.  Some pedons with a B/E horizon do not have a Bt horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, loamy sand, or the gravelly analogs. Some dense substratum phases are recongnized in Michigan."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Glidden, Goodman, Mequithy, Newot, Padus, and Padwetseries.  A similar soil is the Amery series.  Glidden, Padus, and Padwet soils have more than 85 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section and are stratified there. Goodman soils have a 12 to 40 inch silty mantle.  Mequithy soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Newot soils have dense till (Cd) at a depth of 40 to 80 inches.  Amery soils do not have a spodic horizon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sarona soils are on moraines and drumlins of Late Wisconsinan Age.  Slopes range from 1 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in glacial till which is dominantly sandy loam.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 90 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1950 feet."

The poorly drained Capitola soils, the somewhat poorly drained Moodig soils, and the moderately well drained Sarwet soils form a drainage sequence with Sarona soils.  The well drained and moderately well drained Champion and Gogebic soils and the moderately well drained Wabeno soils occupy landscape positions similar to those of Sarona soils where there is a fragipan.  The well drained Goodman soils occupy similar landscape positions where there is a 12 to 40 inch mantle of silt loam.  The well drained and moderately well drained Keweenaw soils occupy similar landscape positions where the soil is more sandy."

Northern hardwoods are the major forest type with sugar maple, American basswood, northern red oak, white ash, quaking aspen, and eastern hemlock the principal species.  Some areas are cleared and used for cropland.  Corn, small grains, and hay are the main crops grown."
