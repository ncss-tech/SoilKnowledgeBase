    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches and extends into the Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Bt2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The Bt horizon is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay, typically averaging between 35 and 45 percent clay, but has a range of 35 to 50 percent clay.  It has less than 15 percent fine and coarser sand and up to 25 percent very fine sand.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral in the Bt1 horizon and neutral or slightly alkaline in the Bt2 horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam or clay loam.  It has few or common fine or medium accumulations of carbonate.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam or clay loam.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  In some pedons, the soil is underlain by sand and gravel and soft shale between depths of 40 and 60 inches."

Ashfork, Blackpipe, Boquillas, Chapin, Emigrant, Huggins, Leyden, Querc, and Wormser soils have bedrock between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  In addition, Chapin and Boquillas soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder in the argillic horizon; Emigrant, Querc, and Wormser soils contain more sand coarser than very fine sand; and Huggins soils have higher CEC/clay ratios.  Boneek, Collbran, Loma, and Rednun soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder.  In addition, Loma soils have carbonates throughout and Rednun soils contain more fine sand coarser than very fine sand.  Kube soils have higher CEC/clay ratios. Nuncho and Nunn soils contain more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand in the Bt horizon.  Richfield soils have warmer temperatures.  Ryus soils have carbonates at or near the surface.  Showlow and Standley soils contain more coarse fragments. Sofia soils contain more than 50 percent clay.  Thunderbird soils contain more fine or coarser sand and formed in material weathered from basalt.  Torreon soils have thicker sola and formed in sediments influenced by basalt."

Slopes are plane to slightly convex.  The Savo soils formed in silty sediments of mixed mineral origin ranging from 40 inches to more than 10 feet thick.

The Altvan, Blackpipe, Keith, and Nunn soils are on similar landscapes.  Altvan soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Keith soils are fine-silty.  Kyle soils do not have a mollic epipedon, have a very-fine control section and are on lower landscapes."
