    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 60 to more than 80 inches.   Combined thickness of the A and E horizons is 20 to 40 inches. Reaction is strongly acid through neutral.  The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The E horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The texture of the A and E horizons is loamy fine sand or fine sand.\nThe Bt horizons are sandy clay loam or clay loam.  The average clay content of the upper 20 inches ranges from 25 to 35 percent. They are very strongly acid to slightly acid.  The Bt1 horizon is 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 7, and chroma of 6 to 8.  A few mottles of strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) are present in some pedons.  The Bt2 horizon is distinctly and prominently mottled gray, red, yellow or brown in hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 8.\nThe Bt/E horizon is mottled in shades of gray, white, red, brown, and yellow in hues of 5YR to 10YR.  It is very strongly acid to slightly acid and contains uncoated sand grains as coatings on peds and in small pockets.  They comprise 5 to 15 percent of the matrix."

Alum and Demona soils have more than 35 percent clay in the Bt horizons.   Bastsil, Konsil, and Selden soils have A and E horizons less than 20 inches thick.  Dutek soils decrease in clay above 60 inches and lack mottles in lower Bt.  Larue and Wolfpen soils are moist for longer periods of time in the moisture control section.  Nimrod soils contain low chroma mottling within 30 inches of the surface.  Nobscot soils lack mottles in the Bt and are dry for longer periods of time.  Padina and Patilo soils have sandy A and E horizons more than 40 inches thick.  Silawa soils decrease in clay above 60 inches and have A and E horizons less than 20 inches thick. Heaton and Silstid soils are on uplands, lack distinct gray mottles in the lower Bt and are deeper to a water table."

The soil formed in sandy and loamy alluvial sediments.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 69 degrees F., and mean annual rainfall ranges from 32 to 40 inches.  Thornthwaite P-E index is about 64. Frost free days range from 240 to 270 days and elevation ranges from 180 to 500 feet."
