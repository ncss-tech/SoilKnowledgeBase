  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist and are dry for 45 to 70 days between depths of 4 and 12 inches during the summer. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 53 degrees to 55 degrees F.  The solum typically is 20 to 36 inches thick but ranges to about 50 inches. Depth to bedrock and to the paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches. Horizon boundaries commonly are clear in the solum but are clear or abrupt to the C1 horizon. Weathered sedimentary rock fragments range from few to 20 percent in the upper part of the C horizon and from 20 to 40 percent in the lower part of the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 2 through 4 dry. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. This horizon has moderate granular and subangular blocky structure.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. The mottling ranges from few fine to many large distinct and prominent gray and red mottles and low chroma mottles are within the upper 10 inches of the horizon. This horizon is silty clay or clay in upper part and clay in the lower part and averages 55 to 70 percent clay. It has moderate or strong subangular blocky or prismatic structure.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist, 2 through 4 dry. Clay ranges from 50 to 70 percent."

Cumley soils lack mottles in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon and are moderately well drained. Dupee soils have 35 to 45 percent clay and more than 35 percent base saturation in their argillic horizon."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Suver soils have gentle to steep slopes in the eastern low foothills of the Coast Range at elevations of 275 to 800 feet. slopes range from 3 to 50 percent. The soils formed in fine textured colluvium and residuum weathered from sedimentary bedrock. The winters are cool and moist and summers are warm and dry. The average January temperature is 39 degrees F. The average July temperature is 67 degrees F. The average annual temperature is 52 degrees to 54 degrees F. The annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches. The frost-free season is 165 to 210 days."

Rickreall soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to a paralithic contact and are well drained.  Willakenzie soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact, have 27 to 35 percent clay, and are well drained."
