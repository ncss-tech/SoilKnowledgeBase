  "OVERVIEW": "The Skull Creek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess high in volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed rocks. The Skull Creek soils are on fan piedmonts and fan piedmonts remnants. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
