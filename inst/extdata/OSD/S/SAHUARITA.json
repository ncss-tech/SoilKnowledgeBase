All of these soils lack buried argillic horizons. In addition, Filaree, Lostman, and Nasagold soils are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30); Pyxo soils are in the Central California Coast Range.  All these soils are dry in some part of the soil moisture control section for more than 20 days cumulative between July and September.  Hayhook soils are noncalcareous to depths of 20 inches or more. Pyxo soils are moderately deep to sandstone bedrock.  Pajarito soils contain less than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sahuarita soils are on fan terraces and basin floors with slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  They formed in stratified alluvium from limestone, schist, phyllite, and granitic rock.  Elevation ranges from 2000 to 3600 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and winter rain.  Mean annual air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 230 to 280 days."
