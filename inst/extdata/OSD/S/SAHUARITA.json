  "OVERVIEW": "The Sahuarita series consists of very deep, well-drained soils formed in alluvium from limestone, schist, phyllite and granitic rock.  Sahuarita soils are on fan terraces and basin floors have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 68 degrees F.",

All of these soils lack buried argillic horizons. In addition, Filaree, Lostman, and Nasagold soils are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30); Pyxo soils are in the Central California Coast Range.  All these soils are dry in some part of the soil moisture control section for more than 20 days cumulative between July and September.  Hayhook soils are noncalcareous to depths of 20 inches or more. Pyxo soils are moderately deep to sandstone bedrock.  Pajarito soils contain less than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section."
