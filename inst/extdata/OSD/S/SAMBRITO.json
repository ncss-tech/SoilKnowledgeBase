Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in the major part of the control section and these are mainly pebbles and cobbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is strongly or medium acid.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.  It is medium acid or slightly acid."

Azwell, Bobtail, Jenkins, Jughandle, and Ryorp soils have a lithic contact above depth of 40 inches.  Hanks soils have sandy-skeletal substratums above depth of 40 inches and are in areas of winter rainfall.  Lake Janee soils are medium or strongly acid, contain a high proportion of medium and coarse angular sand, and have a winter rainfall pattern.  Liggett soils are strongly or very strongly acid, have B2 horizons in which some clay is accumulating as lamellae, and have a winter rainfall pattern.  Walters soils developed in stratified alluvium that is more silty in the upper control section, have continuous horizons of visible carbonate accumulation, and have a continuous A2 horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sambrito soils are on moderately to steeply sloping ridges, mountain sides, and valley side slopes.  Slopes typically range from about 4 to 80 percent.  Elevation is about 9,400 feet.  The soils formed in thick acid gravelly moderately coarse textured materials derived mainly from sedimentary rocks.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is 35 to 40 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 38 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 54 degrees F."
