  "OVERVIEW": "The Sambrito series consists of deep or very deep, well drained soils that formed in thick acid gravelly moderately coarse textured materials derived mainly from sedimentary rocks. Sambrito soils are on moderately to steeply sloping ridges, mountain sides, and valley side slopes and have slopes of 4 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",

Azwell, Bobtail, Jenkins, Jughandle, and Ryorp soils have a lithic contact above depth of 100 cm.  Hanks soils have sandy-skeletal substratums above depth of 100 cm and are in areas of winter rainfall.  Lake Janee soils are medium or strongly acid, contain a high proportion of medium and coarse angular sand, and have a winter rainfall pattern.  Liggett soils are strongly or very strongly acid, have Bw horizons in which some clay is accumulating as lamellae, and have a winter rainfall pattern.  Walters soils developed in stratified alluvium that is more silty in the upper control section, have continuous horizons of visible carbonate accumulation, and have a continuous E horizon."
