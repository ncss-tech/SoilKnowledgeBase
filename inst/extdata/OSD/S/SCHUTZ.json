  "OVERVIEW": "The Schutz series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks on glaciated mountain slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 90 inches and average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
