They formed in glacio-lacustrine sediments with a component of volcanic ash.  The mean January temperature is 33 degrees F, mean July temperature is 61 degrees F, and mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 44 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is 60 to 80 inches.  The frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Classification only changed 4/94 because of recent amendments to Soil Taxonomy.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an albic horizon from the mineral surface to 3 inches, a spodic horizon from 3 to 9 inches, and mottles with a chroma of 2 or less starting at 21 inches and continuing to 60 inches.  The Saxon series needs further study.  It appears to be very similar to the Rober series as defined.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
