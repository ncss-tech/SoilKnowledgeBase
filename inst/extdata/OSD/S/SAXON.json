  "OVERVIEW": "The Saxon series consists of deep moderately well drained soils formed in glacio-lacustrine sediments with a component of volcanic ash.  These soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments with slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is about 70 inches.",

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an albic horizon from the mineral surface to 3 inches, a spodic horizon from 3 to 9 inches, and mottles with a chroma of 2 or less starting at 21 inches and continuing to 60 inches.  The Saxon series needs further study.  It appears to be very similar to the Rober series as defined.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
