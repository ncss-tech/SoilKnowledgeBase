  "STATES": "AR,OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sherless series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum of interbedded shale and sandstone of Mississippian age. These gently sloping to moderately steep soils are on the tops and sides of low ridges in the valleys of the Ouachita Mountains. Water runs off the surface at a medium to rapid rate. Slopes are 1 to 35 percent.",

Cobbles range from 0 to 20 percent by volume in the A horizon, and from 0 to 15 percent by volume in the B horizon. Total volume of coarse fragments is less than 35 percent in\nthe B horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is fine sandy loam, gravelly fine sandy loam, or cobbly fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4. It is fine sandy loam, gravelly fine sandy loam or cobbly fine sandy loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe BE horizon that has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 6 to 8. It is fine sandy loam or loam or their gravelly or cobbly counterparts. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nBt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 6 to 8. Mottles in shades of red and brown range from none to many in the lower part of the B2t horizon. Texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam, or their gravelly or cobbly counterparts. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Cr layer is soft sandstone or shale."

Cheaha soils contain more than 15 percent coarse fragments in the Bt horizon. Fruithurst soils have Cr horizons of weathered slate. Rion soils have a paralithic contact at depths of more than 40 inches. Sherwood soils have a lithic contact at depths of 30 to 60 inches. Tallant soils contain more than 15 percent coarse fragments in the lower solum and have Cr horizons of weathered siltstone. Tidings soils contain more than 15 percent coarse fragments in the Bt horizon. Rome and State soils have sola more than 40 inches thick. Wickham soils have sola formed in stratified materials and do not have Cr horizons. Pirum soils\nhave siliceous mineralogy."
