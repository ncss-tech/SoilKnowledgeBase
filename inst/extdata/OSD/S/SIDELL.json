Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 965 mm (35 to 38 inches).

The series is of small extent\nMLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana.\nSERIES ESTABLISHED: Vermillion County, Illinois, 1930.\nREMARKS: Differentiae separating Tecumseh series and Sidell series are unclear based on current series concepts. The 6/87 revision of the Sidell Official Series Description indicated that Sidell series formed in loess and the underlying loamy glaciofluvium and till, same as Tecumseh series. Historical records indicate that Sidell series formed in loess and the underlying till, and it is believed that this is the correct series concept. This will need to be investigated and resolved during MLRA updating activities.\nThis soil is considered prime farmland.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 30 cm (12 inches) (Ap, A horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 30 to 196 cm (12 to 77 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, 2Bt4, 2Bt5, 2Bt6, 3Bt7, 3Bt8 horizons).\nLithologic discontinuities: at 74 cm (top of the 2B4t horizon); at 117 cm (top of the 3Bt7 horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
