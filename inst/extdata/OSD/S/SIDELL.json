Waupecan soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.\nGEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sidell soils are on till plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. The Sidell soils formed in 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches) of silty material and the underlying loamy glaciofluvial material and till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 965 mm (35 to 38 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 9.4 to 11.1 degrees C (49 to 52 degrees F).\nGEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lauramie and Mellott soils. The well drained Lauramie and Mellott soils have dark colored surface layers less than 25 cm (10 inches) thick. Lauramie soils have more sand in the upper part of the sola and are on more sloping areas in the landscape. Mellott soils are on similar landscape positions.\nDRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium depending on the slope gradient. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate.\nUSE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cropped to corn, soybeans, or small grain. A few areas are used for legume hay or pasture. Native vegetation is tall prairie grasses, chiefly big bluestem.\nDISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 95B, 108A, and 111A in east-central Indiana and Illinois. The series is of small extent\nMLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana.\nSERIES ESTABLISHED: Vermillion County, Illinois, 1930.\nREMARKS: Differentiae separating Tecumseh series and Sidell series are unclear based on current series concepts. The 6/87 revision of the Sidell Official Series Description indicated that Sidell series formed in loess and the underlying loamy glaciofluvium and till, same as Tecumseh series. Historical records indicate that Sidell series formed in loess and the underlying till, and it is believed that this is the correct series concept. This will need to be investigated and resolved during MLRA updating activities.\nThis soil is considered prime farmland.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 30 cm (12 inches) (Ap, A horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 30 to 196 cm (12 to 77 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, 2Bt4, 2Bt5, 2Bt6, 3Bt7, 3Bt8 horizons).\nLithologic discontinuities: at 74 cm (top of the 2B4t horizon); at 117 cm (top of the 3Bt7 horizon)."
