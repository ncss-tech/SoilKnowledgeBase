    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Stillman soils are at elevations of 1,585 to 1,770 meters. Slopes are 1 to 10 percent. These soils occur on alluvial fans, fan skirts and inset fans.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and limestone. The climate is semiarid. The average annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm. The mean annual air temperature is 8.0 to 10.5 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kapture, Redfield, Sanpete and Sigurd series. Kapture soils are coarse-loamy and are on fan skirts.  Redfield soils are fine-silty and are on alluvial flats.  Both of the soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section and are under basin big sagebrush.  Sanpete and Sigurd soils are loamy-skeletal in the control section.  Sanpete soils have a calcic horizon and are on fan remnants under black sagebrush.  Sigurd soils are on fan skirts under basin big sagebrush."

Irrigated crops include alfalfa, corn, barley and oats. Some areas are used for gravel pits.  These soils are correlated to semidesert ecological sites in Utah."
