  "OVERVIEW": "The Stillman series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and limestone. Stillman soils occur on inset fans, fan skirts and alluvial fans and have slopes of 1 to 10 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 230 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

These soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and limestone. The climate is semiarid. The average annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm. The mean annual air temperature is 8.0 to 10.5 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."

Redfield soils are fine-silty and are on alluvial flats.  Both of the soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section and are under basin big sagebrush.  Sanpete and Sigurd soils are loamy-skeletal in the control section.  Sanpete soils have a calcic horizon and are on fan remnants under black sagebrush.  Sigurd soils are on fan skirts under basin big sagebrush."
