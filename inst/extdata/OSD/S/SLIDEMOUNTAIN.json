  "OVERVIEW": "The Slidemountain series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from igneous rock.  These soils occur on mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes are 4 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
