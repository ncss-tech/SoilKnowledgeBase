  "OVERVIEW": "The Stellar series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sediments derived from such rocks as rhyolite, andesite, shale, and monzonite.  Stellar soils are on basin floors and on toe-slopes of alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 67 degrees F.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 3 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 3 to 23 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 and Btk horizons)\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 23 to 59 inches (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3 and Bk4 horizons)\nThis series represents an identified soil within the Desert Soil-Geomorphology Project, Las Cruces, New Mexico.  The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis. Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nMean annual precipitation that ranges from 7 to 11 inches is too dry to qualify as Ustic aridic. The generally accepted range of precipitation in the Ustic aridic moisture regime is 12 to 16 inches. The issue is does the additional moisture contributed by run-on change the soil moisture regime? The dilemma is how to quantify the additions and losses. Determining the soil moisture regime is subjective at best. Attempting to account for run-on adds even more subjectivity to the process. For the purpose of assigning soil moisture regimes in this survey area, the guidelines consistent with what has been done in the adjoining MLRA 41 area should be followed."
