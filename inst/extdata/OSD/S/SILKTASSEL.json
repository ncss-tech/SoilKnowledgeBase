  "OVERVIEW": "The Silktassel series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium derived from tuff.  These steep to very steep soils are on mountain tops and flanks.  Slope ranges from 35 to 95 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
