  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were previously mapped Darwin and Waldron soils in Missouri. They differ from Darwin soils by having loamy materials within the series control section. They differ from Waldron soils by having a mollic epipedon, a cambic horizon, and loamy materials within the series control section. They do not have carbonates throughout the control section for the calcareous class. The name is derived from the name of a historically significant monadnock in the survey area.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 43 centimeters (17 inches) (Ap1 Ap2, and A horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from 43 to 142 centimeters (17 to 56 inches) (Bg1, Bg2 Bg3, and Bg4 horizons), and the loamy textured 2Cg horizon from 142 to 173 centimeters (56 to 68 inches).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data; University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri; Pedon ID M0721912 is data for the OSD typical pedon; Pedon IDs M0718306, M0702709, M0721906, M0721910, M0705119, M0721905, M0418305, and M0721911 are additional data used for the series range in characteristics.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
