  "OVERVIEW": "The Seaquest series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium and sediments from fine-grained non-marine sandstone, tuffaceous siltstone, conglomerate and andesite on hills and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 55 inches. The average annual  temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
