They developed in alluvium and sediments from fine-grained non-marine sandstone of the Wilkes formation, miocene age, tuffaceous siltstone, conglomerate, and andesite.  The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and cool wet winters.  The average January air temperature is 34 degrees F. and in July it is 62 degrees F.  The average annual temperature is 48 degrees F. Frost-free season (32 degrees F) is 180 to 220 days.  The average growing season at 28 degrees F is 200 to 240 days.  The average annual precipitation is 50 to 60 inches."
