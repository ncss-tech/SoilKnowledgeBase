Slope ranges from 15 to 75 percent. Elevations are 1,525 to 2,920 meters (5,000 to 9,580 feet). The climate is sub-humid continental, cool, moist winters and occasional summer thundershowers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 420 millimeters (12 to 17 inches); mean annual air temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C (45 to 49 degrees F), and the frost-free season is 90 to 130 days."
