  "OVERVIEW": "The Sheek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly, cobbly, and stony colluvium and slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Sheek soils are on canyon side slopes and on hills.  Slopes range from 6 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
