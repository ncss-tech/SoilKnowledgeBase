  "OVERVIEW": "The Sucarnoochee series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alkaline clayey alluvium. Sucarnoochee soils are on flood plains of the Alabama and Mississippi Blackland Prairie. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1400 millimeters (55 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C (64 degrees F).",
