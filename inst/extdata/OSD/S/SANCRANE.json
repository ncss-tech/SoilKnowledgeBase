  "OVERVIEW": "The Sancrane series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in medium textured alluvium over flood deposited gravel.  Sancrane soils are on stream terraces and flood plains.  Permeability is moderate through the solum and very rapid in the substratum.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
