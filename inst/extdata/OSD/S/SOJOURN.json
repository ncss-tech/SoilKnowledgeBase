Elevations range from 6,200 to 7,400 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches with about half falling as winter snow and half falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."
