  "OVERVIEW": "The Smithland series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on flood plains and upland drainageways. These soils formed in alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 711 millimeters (28 inches).",
