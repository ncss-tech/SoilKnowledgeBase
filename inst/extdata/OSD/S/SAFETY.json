These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 days following the summer solstice.  Depth to paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments in the particle-size control section range from 5 to 25 percent by volume.  The particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.30 to 1.40 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A1 horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent by volume.  Surface stones and boulders range from 1 to 3 percent.\nThe A2 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 20 percent by volume.  Textures are sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent by volume.  Textures are sandy loam, gravelly fine sandy loam, or gravelly coarse sandy loam."

They are formed in loess and volcanic ash mixed with residuum from granitic rock.   Elevations are 1,700 to 3,800 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 to 25 inches.  The average January temperature is about 26 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 68 degrees F.; average annual temperature is about 46 to 48 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees is 140 to 180 days."
