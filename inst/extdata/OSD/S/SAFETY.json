  "OVERVIEW": "The Safety series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in loess and volcanic ash mixed with residuum from granitic rocks.  Safety soils are on mountain sideslopes that generally have a southerly aspect.  Elevations are 1,700 to 3,800 feet.  Slopes range from 8 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches and average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 days following the summer solstice.  Depth to paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments in the particle-size control section range from 5 to 25 percent by volume.  The particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.30 to 1.40 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A1 horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent by volume.  Surface stones and boulders range from 1 to 3 percent.\nThe A2 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 20 percent by volume.  Textures are sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent by volume.  Textures are sandy loam, gravelly fine sandy loam, or gravelly coarse sandy loam."
