  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F.  These soils are typically calcareous to the surface, but some pedons are leached a few inches in the surface horizon.  The particle-size control section has a matrix texture of loam or sandy loam with 10 to 27 percent clay.  Coarse fragments are highly variable and range from 35 to 80 percent pebbles, cobbles, and stones.  Either class may dominate or be uniformly mixed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Carbonates range from 4 to 14 percent.  The segregations of carbonate appear to be a result of the wetting cycles involved when the material was laid down and not a result of pedogenetic development.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Southace soils are on upper fan aprons, terrace slopes, and mountain or hill slopes.  They formed in skeletal, calcareous slope alluvium and sediments derived from red sedimentary rock.  Slopes are 1 to 65 percent.  Elevations range from 7,300 to 8,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 16 inches of which about half falls as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 60 to 90 days."
