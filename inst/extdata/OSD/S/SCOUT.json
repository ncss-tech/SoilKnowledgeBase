  "OVERVIEW": "The Scout series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in till, colluvium, slope alluvium, and residuum from sandstone, conglomerate, basalt, quartzite, rhyolite, andesite, and tuff.  Scout soils are on mountain slopes, mesa summits, broad ridge tops, and spur ridges and have slopes of 0 to 70 percent.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  The mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 F.",
