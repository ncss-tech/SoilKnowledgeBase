  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Scout soils are on very steep mountain slopes, mesa summits, broad ridge tops, and spur ridges at elevations of 6,500 to 12,200 feet. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent, commonly with north and east aspect.  These soils formed in till, colluvium, and residuum from sandstone, conglomerate, basalt, quartzite, rhyolite, andesite, and tuff.  The climate is humid.  The average annual precipitation is about 24 to 45 inches and comes mostly as snow during the winter months.  The mean annual temperature is 34 to 40 F., the mean summer temperature is 48 to 55 F., and freeze-free period is 30 to 90 days."
