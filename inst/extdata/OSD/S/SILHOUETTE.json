  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Rock fragments typically are less than 10 percent and are concentrated on the soil surface.  These soils typically are calcareous throughout but may be leached in the upper 4 inches in some pedons.  Depth to secondary calcium carbonate accumulation ranges from 12 to 24 inches.  Depth to paralithic contact, usually shale, is greater than 60 inches.  Textures are clay, silty clay, silty clay loam or clay loam throughout. The particle-size control section has 35 to 50 percent clay.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. which occurs about April 21 to 27, and is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days from July 15 to October 25 and for at least 90 cumulative days during this period.   The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days. Exchangeable sodium content is less than 15 percent.  Authigenic gypsum is present in some pedons.  EC is 0 to 4 mmhos throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value or 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  few faint clay films are present in some pedons, but clay increase is negligible.\nThe Bk horizon (and C horizons if present) have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline. The calcium carbonate equivalent of this horizon ranges from 3 to 14 percent and commonly increases with depth."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Silhouette soils are on hills, ridges, alluvial fan, fan remnants, relict terraces and fan aprons.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in fine textured local alluvium derived from calcareous shale.  Elevations are 3,500 to 6,500 feet.  Precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches with over half falling in April, May, and early June and less than one inch falling in each month of July, August, September, and October.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."
