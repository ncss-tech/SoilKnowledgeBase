The mean annual soil temperature is about 56 to 58 degrees F.  Organic matter is more than 1 percent at a depth of 20 inches and decreases irregularly with increasing depth.  Base saturation is more than 50 percent in all parts and less than 75 percent in some or all parts of the profile to a depth of 30 inches.  The profile is medium acid to neutral throughout.  Pebbles average 0 to 15 percent by volume.\nThe A horizon is very dark gray, very dark grayish brown, dark gray, dark grayish brown, dark brown, or grayish brown (10YR 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2).  It is heavy sandy loam, loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have a horizon designated as a B horizon with color of light yellowish brown or very pale brown (10YR 6/4, 7/4).  Texture is heavy sandy loam, loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon is dark brown, dark grayish brown, dark yellowish brown, brown or yellowish brown (10YR 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4).  It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.  In some pedons are narrow lenses of sandy loam, loamy sand, or sand with 0 to 25 percent pebbles by volume."
