    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stehekin soils are found on slopes of 0 to 35 percent on debris aprons, debris cones, and valley walls of glaciated mountain landscapes at elevations from 700 to 1,300 meters.  They formed in volcanic ash overlying glacial drift and colluvium from glacial drift.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,000 to 1,700 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 6 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 40 to 75 days."
