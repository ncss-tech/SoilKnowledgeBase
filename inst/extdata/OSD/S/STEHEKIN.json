  "OVERVIEW": "The Stehekin series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed volcanic ash, glacial till, and colluvium.  Stehekin soils are found on slopes of 0 to 65 percent on debris aprons, debris cones and valley walls of glaciated mountain landscapes.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1,500 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
