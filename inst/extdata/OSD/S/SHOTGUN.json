The Amsden, Buffork, Cific, Croydon, Gelkie, Hourglass, Kittredge, Leavitt, Lyoman, Michelson, Monad, Monida, Morset, Newlands, Oro Fino, Philipsburg, Swede, Tingey, Wellsville, and Youga soils are deeper than 40 inches.  The Inchau, Lymanson, Tripit, and Troutdale soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  The Dra, Lymanson, Passcreek, Rammel, and Woosley soils have layers in the profile which contain calcium carbonate.  Kezar soils are extremely hard when dry and have sandy textures in the profile.  Lucky soils have average annual soil temperatures of 40 to 44 degrees F. and have more than 35 percent fine and coarser sand in the particle-size control section.  Miracle soils have hues of 5YR or redder in the argillic horizon.  Mult soils are usually moist.  Primeaux soils have an anverage annual soil teperature which is greater than 40 degrees F.  Slacks soils have more than 35 percent fine and coarser sand in the particle-size control section."

Judkins soils have ochric epipedons and are loamy-skeletal.  They formed from rhyolite or basalt under forested conditions.  Spliten soils are shallow.  They formed in loess deposits on steeper slopes of more recent basalt flows."
