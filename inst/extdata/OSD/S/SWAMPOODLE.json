  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 25 to 50 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The solum typically contains no rock fragments; however, they can range from 0 to 10 percent in the solum and from 0 to 25 percent in the C horizons.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid unless limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam in the upper part and sandy loam, loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay in the lower part.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 8.  Texture in the fine earth fraction is variable, ranging from sandy loam to silty clay but is normally sandy loam, loam, or silt loam."

Reaville soils have bedrock within 40 inches of the surface.  Bogart soils contain more rock fragments. Conowingo soils contain serpentine.  Haney soils contain carbonates.  Mount Lucas soils contain porcelainite channers.  Vaughnsville soils contain more clay in the lower part of the solum. Williamstown soils formed in glacial till.  Tuscola soils are stratified."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Swampoodle soils are on gently sloping concave uplands, in saddles, and on footslopes along intermittent drainageways.  Slope gradient ranges from 0 to 8 percent and is dominantly less than 4 percent.  These soils formed in parent materials derived from local colluvial over residual material weathered from greenstone schist, biotite schist, and basic gneiss rocks.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 60 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 42 inches."

Chemical analyses performed by Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University staff.  Lab numbers for this pedon are as follows: Loudoun County DER, 940040-940043; VPI&SU 94-53-176.  In addition, 16 other pedons have been sampled for PSA and 11 for chemistry.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
