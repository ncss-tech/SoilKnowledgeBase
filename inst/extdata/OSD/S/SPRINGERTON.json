  "OVERVIEW": "The Springerton series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loamy stratified outwash. Springerton soils are on nearly level or slightly depressional parts of outwash plains, stream terraces, or high flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
