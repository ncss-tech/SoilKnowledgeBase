  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Anahuac series based on landform and chemistry. Anahuac soils do not meet the base saturation requirements necessary for the mollisols order and these soils are broader landforms. The series type location was moved from Jefferson County, Texas to its current location due to the presence of laboratory data.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 37 to 87 cm (15 to 35 in. (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons))\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 26 cm (0 to 10 in). (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon: 37 to 203 cm (15 to 80 in). (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, Btkg, Btg horizons)\nEndosaturation: The zone of saturation at 177 to 203 cm (70 to 80 in). (Btkg, and Btg horizons)\nEpisaturation: The zone of saturation at 37 to 50 cm (15 to 20 in). (Bt1 horizon)\nAdditional Comments:  Electrical conductivity values increase above 2 in those areas impacted by storm surge and become sodic. The saltwater damages plants for a period up to a year after the storm but will recover to pre-storm levels if the area receives normal rainfall.\nADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL data exists on pedon S10TX0713682 from the type location and on S2012TX291009. Additional information exists on pedon S10TX0713680, S10TX0712762, and S12TX2451002; however, these pedons are taxadjuncts to the series.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
