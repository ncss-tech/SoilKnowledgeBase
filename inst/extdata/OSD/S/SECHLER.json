  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the loamy alluvium and depth to siliceous sandy alluvium range from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the umbric epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Base saturation by NH4OAc is less than 50 percent throughout the series control section and by sum of cations is less than 35 percent.  Volume of coarse fragments averages less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section but averages more than 35 percent in the cambic horizon.  Coarse fragments consist entirely of irregularly shaped iron nodules in the loamy alluvium and are iron nodules or sandstone gravel or channers in the sandy alluvium.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 25 percent in the A horizons and from 20 to 65 percent in individual subhorizons in the cambic horizon.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the loamy allvium.  Coarse fragments typically are absent in the sandy alluvium but volume of gravel or sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Reaction typically ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the solum but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the substratum.  Redox accumulations are throughout the pedon below the umbric epipedon.  Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are within a depth of 20 inches and also aquic conditions for some time in most years.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 2 to 3; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Color value is 5 or less dry.\nThe Bw horizon typically has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 2.5 to 4; and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is typically the very gravelly analogs of loam or silt loam in the upper part grading to the very gravelly analogs of fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the lower part. In some pedons, thin individual subhorizons are the gravelly analogs of these textures.\nThe 2Bg or 2Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 3.  It is loamy fine sand or loamy sand.\nThe 2C or 2Cg horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is fine sand or sand that typically has a few thin strata of finer texture."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  Similar soils in other families are the Northbend and Sturgeon series.  Northbend soils do not have an umbric epipedon; have an irregular decrease in organic matter with depth; and have less than 5 percent coarse fragments throughout.  Sturgeon soils are frigid and are coarse-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sechler soils are on plane or slightly convex slopes on flood plains. Slope gradients ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in siliceous loamy alluvium which has a high content of iron nodules and in the underlying siliceous sandy alluvium.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1000 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Absco, Kalmarville, Northbend, Trempealeau, and Whitehall soils.  The moderately well drained Absco soils are in slightly higher positions on the floodplain than Sechler soils where the soil is sandy throughout.  The poorly drained Kalmarville soils are in lower more frequently flooded positions on the floodplain.  The somewhat poorly drained Northbend soils are in landscape positions similar to those of Sechler soils where there are few or no iron concretions in the soil. The well drained Trempealeau soils and the well drained and moderately well drained Whitehall soils are in higher landscape positions on stream terraces which are rarely or never flooded and where the loamy mantle has more silt and clay."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Surface runoff is slow or very slow.  Permeability is moderate in the loamy alluvium and rapid in the sandy alluvium.  Sechler soils are subject to occasional brief flooding. The main period of flooding is March to June, but flooding can occur following any period of high runoff.  These soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 to 2 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period October to June in 6 or more out 10 years."
