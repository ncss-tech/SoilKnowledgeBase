Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from vitric tuff and breccia.  The climate is hot and dry in the summer and cool and moist in the winter.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 200 to 250 cm and the average annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 10.0 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 90 to 125 days."
