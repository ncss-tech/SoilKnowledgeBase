  "OVERVIEW": "The Sugarcreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from vitric tuff and breccia. They are on sideslopes and summits of structural benches.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes are 3 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the average annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C.",
