  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 to 49 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist.  The particle-size control section contains less than 1 percent rock fragments and is commonly stratified in the lower part.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter temperature is less than 25 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is silt loam, loam or sandy loam.  It is strongly acid or moderately acid.  The C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is very fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It is strongly acid or moderately acid.  In some pedons loamy sand or sand occurs below a depth of 40 inches."

Amostown soils have lithologic discontinuity at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Ashe, Cardigan, Chatfield, Ditney, Hazel, Lordstown, Marblemount, Steinsburg, and Yalesville soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Bernardston, Broadbrook, Nantucket, Newport, Paxton, Pittstown, and Wethersfield soils have a very firm Cr horizon at a depth of less than 20 inches.  Brookfield soils have hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR in the upper part of the B horizon.  Charlton, Dutchess, St.  Albans, and Valois soils have 5 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. Cheshire soils have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and have 5 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size section.  Riverhead soils have stratified sand and gravel 2C horizons within the particle size control section.  Information is not available to differentiate the Pollux series."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on terraces and alluvial fans in main river valleys at elevations of 30 to 300 feet.  These soils formed in alluvium from adjacent sandstone uplands.  The coarse grain soil particles are mainly quartz.  The average annual precipitation is 60 to 80 inches with relatively dry summers and mild, wet winters.  The mean January temperature is about 39 degrees F and the mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F.The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  and the growing season (32 degrees F.) is 200 to 240 days."
