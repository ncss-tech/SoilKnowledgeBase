  "OVERVIEW": "The Sunsetcone series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that formed in volcanic tephra. Sunsetcone soils are on north-facing slopes on cinder cones.  Slopes are 30 to 60 percent. The permeability is moderately rapid. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
