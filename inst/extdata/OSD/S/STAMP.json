(Part of the Bw1, the Bw2, Cg1, Cg2, Cg3, and part of the 2Cg4 horizons)\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Aquic Eutrocryepts to Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Aquic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups.
