  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum over sandy sediments ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches. Calcium carbonate equivalent in the 10- to 40-inch particle size control section is 0 to 25 percent by weight. Pebbles and cobbles comprise 0 to 5 percent by weight of any horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bw or Bk horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam. The silicate clay content of the 10- to 40-inch particle size control section is 12 to 18 percent. Carbonate clay is 1 to about 6 percent. Visible carbonates in the form of threads, films, masses, and concretions range from 1 to 10 percent.\nThe BCk horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 to 8 and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand. Visible carbonates in the form of threads, films, masses, and concretions range from 1 to 15 percent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Cayo soils are moderately well drained and have an SAR of greater than 13 below a depth of 20 inches. Colibro and McAllen soils are in the fine-loamy family. Lagloria soils are in the coarse-silty family and have fluventic features."

The soil formed in calcareous loamy sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 26 to 34 inches. The mean annual temperature is 70 to 74 degrees F. The annual Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 38 to 46. Frost free days range from 275 to 300. Elevation ranges from 250 to 450 feet."
