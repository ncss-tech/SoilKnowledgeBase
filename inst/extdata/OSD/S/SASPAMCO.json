    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum over sandy sediments ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches. Calcium carbonate equivalent in the 10- to 40-inch particle size control section is 0 to 25 percent by weight. Pebbles and cobbles comprise 0 to 5 percent by weight of any horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bw or Bk horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam. The silicate clay content of the 10- to 40-inch particle size control section is 12 to 18 percent. Carbonate clay is 1 to about 6 percent. Visible carbonates in the form of threads, films, masses, and concretions range from 1 to 10 percent.\nThe BCk horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 to 8 and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand. Visible carbonates in the form of threads, films, masses, and concretions range from 1 to 15 percent."

Cayo soils are moderately well drained and have an SAR of greater than 13 below a depth of 20 inches. Colibro and McAllen soils are in the fine-loamy family. Lagloria soils are in the coarse-silty family and have fluventic features."
