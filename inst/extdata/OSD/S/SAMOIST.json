  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 6 to 20 inches.  The family control section contains from 35 to 50 percent clay and is either a heavy clay loam or clay.  Coarse fragments, when present, are less than 10 percent and break down with pretreatment.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.  The soil is typically dry in some or all parts of the moisture control section from July 20 to September 30 in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is heavy clay loam or clay with 35 to 45 percent clay.  Reaction is mildly through strongly alkaline.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.\nThe Bw horizon, when present, has the same range as the A horizon.  Weak or moderate grades of angular blocky structure are common.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y value of 5 through 7 moist and dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is most commonly clay with clay loam less common.  Clay ranges from 35 to 50 percent.  Reaction is moderately to strongly alkaline.  EC ranges from 0 to 4 mmhos.  The carbonates range from 5 to 13 percent throughout the horizon with only limited evidence in some pedons of segregation."

The Moyerson soils are drier and have mean annual precipitation of 10 to 14 inches.  The Wiscow soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder.  The Yawdim soils lack soft, coarse fragments in the control section."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Samoist soils are on metastable hillslopes, shoulders, and backslopes on uplands.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in slopewash alluvium and residual material weathered primarily from calcareous gray clay shale.  Elevations are 4,500 to 6,000 feet.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches but ranges from 15 to 19.  Over half the precipitation falls in April, May, and June.  The mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F. but ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is typically 90 to 110 days but in isolated areas may vary somewhat from the norm."
