These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from bedrock of siltstone, sandstone, and conglomerate lithologies. The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and cool, dry summers. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 90 to 120 inches. Mean annual air temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."
