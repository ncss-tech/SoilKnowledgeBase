Series in similar families are the Aaron, Alsup, Beemont, Brookside, Derinda, Ebal, Goodson, Gunlock, Losantville, Medary, Miamian, Morrisville, Purdin, Shircliff, Skranka, Useful, Vincent, and Winnegan series. Aaron, Alsup, Beemont, Goodson, Morrisville, and Useful soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Brookside soils do not have colors redder than 7.5YR and have a mean annual temperature of 46 to 55 degrees F. Derinda soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Ebal soils formed in colluvium from siltstone and the underlying residuum from interbedded shale and sandstone. Gunlock soils have horizons with fragic characteristics. Losantville, Miamian, Purdin, and Winnegan soils formed in glacial till. In addition, Losantville soils have carbonates at 8 to 20 inches; Miamian soils have carbonates at 18 to 40 inches; Purdin soils have carbonates at 24 to 40 inches; and Shircliff soils have carbonates at 30 to 60 inches. Medary soils are superactive and lack rock fragments. Skranka soils are active and formed in basic igneous materials. Vincent soils formed in lacustrine sediments and have fewer rock fragments. Winnegan soils are superactive and have carbonates at 24 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Swiss soils are on upland side slopes, and less commonly on summit positions. Slopes commonly are 8 to 20 percent, but range from 3 to 35 percent. These soils formed in cherty sediments and the underlying clay deposits. The A and E horizons are believed to have formed in clastic sediments. The 2Bt horizon formed in clays of Pennsylvanian age. The mean annual temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 36 to 45 inches."

This series was originally proposed as a very-fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Hapludalf.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:\nl) Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 9 inches (A and E horizons)\n2) Argillic horizon- the zone from a depth of 9 to 40 inches ( 2Bt horizons)\n3) The Cd horizon in not considered to be paralithic material  due to fracturing less than 10 centimeters apart.\n4) Low chroma colors do not necessarily define the present soil drainage, but are often due to the color of the original parent materials.\nADDITIONAL DATA: This soil is mapped in the Pennsylvanian age geologic formation in Missouri.\nThe University of Missouri soil characterization lab data reference number is M9015149.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
