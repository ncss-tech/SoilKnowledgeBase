The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 56 degrees F.  The soil is usually moist but is dry within all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay, and more than 15 percent sand that is coarser than very fine.\nThe A and AB horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Clay content is 10 to 29 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent gravel.  It is moderately or strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is loam, clay loam, or gravelly loam with 15 to 35 percent clay with increasing clay content with depth.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent gravel.  It is moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon, when present, hue is 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist, 3 to 6 dry.  It is is gravelly clay loam, gravelly loam, very gravelly clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay.  It has 20 to 45 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - from the surface of the soil to 10 inches.  (A and AB horizons), base saturation by ammonium acetate is 64 and 73 percent and organic carbon is 0.77 in the AB horizon.\nCambic horizon - from 10 to 45 inches.  (Bw1, Bw2, and Bw3, horizons), base saturation by sum is 53, 61, and 74 percent and organic carbon is 0.58, 0.25, and 0.27 percent..\nParticle-size control section - from 10 to 40 inches.  (Bw1, Bw2, and Bw3 horizons), dispersion is fair and average clay content based on the 15 bar water is 18 percent.\nUltic subgroup- base saturation is less than 75 percent throughout from 10 to 45 inches. .\nThis soil typically has uniform sand size (fine and very fine sand) with a high mica content (although not high enough to have a micaceous mineralogy family classification).  The soil exhibits weak to moderate dilatency.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added to the classification in 10/2005. The competing series section was not updated at that time. Last revision 3/1995.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Partial laboratory data is available for this pedon.  Reference samples S86OR-019-001 from Douglas County, Oregon, NSSL, Lincoln, NE 1/87.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
