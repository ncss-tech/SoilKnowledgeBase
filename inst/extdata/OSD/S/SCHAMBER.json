  "OVERVIEW": "The Schamber series consists of well to excessively drained soils that are very shallow over sand and gravel outwash sediments.  Permeability is rapid or very rapid.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Content of gravel ranges from 35 to over 50 percent by volume in all parts of the series control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is too light colored or too thin to qualify for a mollic epipedon.  It is gravelly loam, loam, sandy loam, gravelly fine sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam, or very gravelly loam and contains up to 50 percent gravel by volume.  It ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  Gravel varies greatly in color.  The C horizon is sand and gravel as very gravelly sand or very gravelly loamy sand.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Typically, calcium carbonate coats the lower sides of the pebbles and calcium carbonate can range up to 15 percent in the upper part.  Some pedons are noncalcareous throughout."

Surfaces are convex or plane with slope gradients ranging from 0 to 60 percent.  The soil mostly formed in sand and gravel outwash sediments.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 24 inches.  Frost free period ranges from 110 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 1,300 to 4,800 feet."

Lakoma, Opal, Pierre and Samsil soils contain more clay and formed in residuum from shale and are on landscapes below the Schamber soils."
