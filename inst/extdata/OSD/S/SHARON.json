  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. Soils in closely associated families are the Arenzville, Belknap, Cuba, Haymond, Steff and Wilbur series. Arenzville, Haymond, and Wilbur soils are nonacid. In addition, Arenzville soils have a buried soil within a depth of 40 inches below the soil surface. Belknap soils are dominated by chroma of 2 or less in the upper part of the profile. Cuba and Steff soils average more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

Sharon soils formed in silty, acid alluvium. Mean annual temperature varies from 11 to 14 degrees C (54 to 57 degrees F), mean annual precipitation varies from 813 to 1219 mm (32 to 48 inches), frost free days range from 170 to 232 days, and elevation ranges from 104 to 311 meters (340 feet to 1020 feet) above sea level."

Belknap, Banlic, and Bonnie soils are more poorly drained and are dominated by lower chroma in the control section. Belknap and Bonnie soils are on lower lying parts of the flood plain. Banlic soils are on very low stream terraces. Burnside soils contain more sand and rock fragments in the control section and are on similar nearby flood plains."
