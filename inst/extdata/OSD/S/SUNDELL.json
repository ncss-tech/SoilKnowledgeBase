  "REVDATE": "05/1999",
  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Sundell series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy glacial materials 20 to 40 inches thick, over limestone on ground moraines and glacial lake benches.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to limestone ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The solum ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  Volume of pebbles, cobbles, and limestone flags ranges from 1 to 15 percent throughout the solum and from 5 to 25 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or is neutral; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Some pedons have thin E horizons.\nThe B/A horizon has tongues of A material surrounding the B horizon.  The A material has similar colors and textures as the A horizon.  The B portion of this horizon has similar colors and textures as the Bw horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has a hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.\nThe C horizon has a hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is fine sandy loam, loam or sandy loam or the gravelly analogues of these textures."

Firth soils do not have bedrock within depths of 40 inches, are at higher elevations and have lower mean annual precipitation.  Kawbawgam soils have spodic horizons, are more acid and are underlain by sandstone."
