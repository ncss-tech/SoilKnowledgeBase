  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates is typically 10 to 40 inches but ranges to the surface in some pedons.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches thick.  Those less than 10 inches thick are sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  The series control section average has 2 to 35 percent rock fragments (by volume).  The rock fragments are of mixed lithology and typically 2 to 60 mm in size. However, they may range up to 250 mm in size.  The series control section has more than 30 percent medium sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, sand, coarse sand or their gravelly analogues.  Some pedons have an AB horizon.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, sand or their gravelly analogues.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is coarse sand or sand or their gravelly analogues.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Carbonate coats are commonly on the bottom side of rock fragments.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe C or 2C horizons have hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is coarse sand, sand, or their gravelly analogues.  Some pedons have very gravelly textures below 40 inches. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Kost, Lohnes, and Maddock soils have less than 5 percent rock fragments (by volume) in the series control section.  In addition, Kost and Maddock soils contain less than 30 percent medium sand and coarser in the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sandberg soils are on outwash plains, glacial beach ridges, valley trains, stream terraces and glacial moraines.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  They formed in sandy and gravelly outwash sediments or glacial beach deposits with or without a thin loamy upper mantle.  These sediments are late Wisconsin in age.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 28 inches.  About 80 percent of the precipitation falls during the growing season.  The frost-free days range from 90 to 145.  The elevation ranges from 800 to 2000 feet above sea level."

Forada, Mavie, and Syrene soils are poorly and very poorly drained and in lower lying positions.  Clontarf, Flaming, Osakis, and Radium soils are moderately well drained and in nearby deeply set concave swales and on lower lying flats.  Arvilla, Dorset, and Sverdrup soils are on slightly lower landscape positions and have thicker loamy mantles.  The well drained Fordville soils are in nearby shallow swales and have a thicker loamy mantle.  Sandberg soils are occasionally associated with glacial till soils."
