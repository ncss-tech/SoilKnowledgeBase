  "OVERVIEW": "The Siphoncan series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from granite.  Siphoncan soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 10 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
