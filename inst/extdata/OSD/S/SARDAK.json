The 10 to 40 inch particle size control section contains less than 10% silt plus clay, and less than 40% silt plus clay plus very fine sand.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6, 3 to 5 moist; and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sand, or fine sandy loam.  A silty clay overwash phase is also recognized.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand. Stratification is evident throughout the C horizon."

Biltmore, Dabney, Oakville, Penwood, Perks, Plainfield, Suncook, Tyner, Westport, and Windsor soils are more acid and lack free carbonates. Caesar and Spessard soils have a B horizon and have sola more than 15 inches thick.  Chute soils lack stratification within the control section.  Hodge soils contain more than 40% silt plus clay plus very fine sand. Pinegrove soil contain coarse fragments of sandstone and shale throughout the series control section.  Sarpy soils have a mean annual precipitation of more than 26 inches."

Albaton and Wabash soils are clayey and occupy nearly level parts of the flood plain.  Carr and Landes soils are coarse-loamy and Haynie soils are coarse-silty.  These soils are more gently sloping, less undulating positions of the flood plain.  Grable and Percival soils are finer textured in the upper part, and Onawa soils are finer textured throughout.  Grable soils occur on flood plains but are less undulating and occur further back from the river.  Percival and Onawa soils occur on nearly level flood plains.  Modale and Waubonsie soils are clayey below a depth of about 2 feet and occur on nearly level flood plains."
