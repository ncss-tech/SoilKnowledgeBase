  "OVERVIEW": "The Spitzen series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in eolian deposits over loamy alluvium derived from sandstone, shale, limestone and quartzite.  Spitzen soils are on alluvial flats.  Slopes are 1 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
