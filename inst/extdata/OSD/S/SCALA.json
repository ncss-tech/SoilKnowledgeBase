The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.30 to 1.60 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples. The particle-size control section has 5 to 12 percent clay, more than 15 per;cent particles coarser than very fine sand, and 0 to 5 percent pebbles. Reaction is slightly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry, 1 or 2 moist.\nThe Bw and E/B horizons have hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist. The Bw and E part of the E/B horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam. The B part of the E/B horizon consists of 7.5YR band of clay accumulation. The bands of clay accumulation are less than 6 inches in total thickness.\nThe 2Bw and 2Bt horizon have hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. In some pedons the 2Bw and 2Bt horizon are at depths of 60 inches or more."

Barron soils have a solum 30 to 40 inches thick and a mean soil temperature of 54 to 56 F. Cassolary soils have a solum 15 to 30 inches thick and a 2C horizon above 40 inches that is stratified silt loam, silty clay loam, and clay loam.\nClayton soils are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days. Frailey and Quiden soils have a loam or gravelly loam control section. Green Bluff soils have 35 to 60 percent pyroclastic material in the control section. Hudnut, Kartar, Koseth, and Stoner soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Koerling soils are calcareous below a depth of 24 to 40 inches."
