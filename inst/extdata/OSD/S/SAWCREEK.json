  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches thick. The solum ranges from 12 to 30 inches thick and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Organic carbon in the mollic epipedon ranges from .7 to 2.5 percent and decreases uniformly with increasing depth. The soil is 80 to 100 percent base-saturated. The 10-to 40-inch control section is typically sandy loam but clay ranges from 5 to 18 percent, silt from 5 to 30 percent, and sand from 52 to 80 percent with more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand. Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in a major part of the control section. Mean annual temperature ranges from 32 degrees to 46 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature from 40 degrees to 58 degrees F. The A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It usually has granular or crumb structure, but it has subangular blocky structure in some pedons. This horizon is soft or slightly hard. It is slightly acid or neutral (pH 6.1 to 7.3). The B2 horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Hue redder than 7.5YR should not be lithochromic and should be discontinuous from pedon to pedon. The B2 horizon usually has subangular blocky structure but has prismatic structure in some pedons. It should have redder hue or brighter chroma than overlying and underlying horizons or have moderate structure. In some localities the B2 horizon is absent, in which case the A1 horizon is more than 10 inches thick and has brighter chroma, higher value in its lower part or have moderate subangular blocky structure in its lower part. The B2 horizon is slightly acid or neutral (pH 6.1 to 7.3). The C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR. It is slightly acid or neutral (pH 6.1 to 7.3)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in moderately coarse textured slightly acid parent materials weathered residually from brown or grayish brown noncalcareous sandstone. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 20 inches, 10 inches of which falls during the months of April through August. The average annual temperature is 40 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is 50 degrees F."
