  "OVERVIEW": "The Schwacheim series consists of shallow, well drain soils that formed in colluvium and residuum.  Schwacheim soils are on basalt mesas and lava plateaus.  Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 26 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 to 42 degrees F.",
