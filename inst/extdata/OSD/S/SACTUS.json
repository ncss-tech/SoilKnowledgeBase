  "OVERVIEW": "The Sactus series consists of very shallow to bedrock, well drained soils that formed of residuum from extrusive igneous rock.  Sactus soils are on ridges and summits.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes are 10 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
