  "OVERVIEW": "The Silverjack series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium or landslide deposits. These soils are on mountain slopes and landslides. Slopes are 3 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.",
