  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Spinnaker series consists of shallow to bedrock soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from volcanic breccia, andesite, basalt or dacite. Spinnaker soils are on mountains and hills on islands. Slopes range from 15 to 100 percent. Elevations are 50 to 2440 feet (15 to 744 meters). The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters with intermittent wet coastal fog throughout the year. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 24 inches (330 to 610 millimeters), the mean annual temperature is 61 to 73 degrees F. (16 to 23 degrees C.), and the frost free season is 320 to 365 days."

Tongva is moderately deep and predominately found on lower parts of mountains and side slopes of hills under coastal sage. Fiale is a found on gentler slopes under grass.  Topdeck soils have argillic horizons and is found on all portions of hills and mountains primarily under coastal sage. Rudder soils are isomesic with low base saturations, and are on side slopes of mountains under bishop pines."
