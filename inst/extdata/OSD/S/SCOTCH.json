  "OVERVIEW": "The Scotch series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and interbedded shale.  Scotch soils are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes range from 30 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
