  "OVERVIEW": "The Skinner series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt.  These soils are on side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 25 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 100 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean soil temperature ranges from 49 to 53 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days during the summer.  The solum ranges from 24 to 40 inches thick and depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to the clayey BCt horizon ranges from 25 to 40 inches but is commonly 30 inches or more.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 25 percent in the A horizons and up to 35 percent in the Bw horizons, and in the BCt horizons the amount is commonly more than 35 percent, ranging up to 65 percent below depth of 40 inches.  The 10 to 40 inch control section averages less than 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value closest to the 2 in the upper part and 2 or 3 in the lower part or BA horizon, and chroma of 1 to 3 in the A and closest to 4 in the BA horizon.  It has strong very fine or fine granular grading to very fine subangular blocky or granular in the BA horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value closest to 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It is gravelly or cobbly clay loam.  It commonly has weak very fine to medium subangular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon where present and BC horizons are clay loam or clay and are massive or have very weak subangular blocky structure."

Muskingum soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Sadie soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to very hard, very firm and brittle basal till.  Sund soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact over greenstone bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Skinner soils are on smooth or dissected smooth steep slopes in mountainous topography at elevations of 300 to 1,800 feet; slope gradients range from 25 to 75 percent.  The soils formed in moderately fine textured colluvium over very cobbly or stony clayey residuum or colluvium weathered from volcanic basalt.  The rock occurs usually as breccia with numerous thin beds of tuffaceous siltstone between flows.  The climate is marine-like in character with an annual precipitation of 60 to 100 inches and with a short dry season during the summer.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F; the average January temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F; and the average July temperature is 55 to 58 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 160 to 225 days."

On recent burned over or cut over areas, there are salal, salmonberry, thimbleberry, swordfern, and hemlock seedlings."
