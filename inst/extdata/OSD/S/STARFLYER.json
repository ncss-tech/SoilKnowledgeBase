  "OVERVIEW": "The Starflyer series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuff. Starflyer soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 4 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
