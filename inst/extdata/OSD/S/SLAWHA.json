  "OVERVIEW": "The Slawha series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  Slawha soils are on alluvial flats, flood plains, and low river terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
