Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe A horizon is marl with a non-carbonate free texture of silt or silty loam.  This horizon is more than 90 percent calcium carbonate.  Percent by volume of coral or limestone fragments is less than 15 percent.\nThe 2R horizon is soft to hard, but rippable coral or oolitic limestone."
