  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Short Creek soils are on south facing side slopes of fan piedmont remnants, alluvial fans and ballenas and in some areas on hills.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic and sedimentary rocks and in some areas, colluvium derived from welded tuffs and rhyolite.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,520 to 2,290 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is about 80 to 100 days."
