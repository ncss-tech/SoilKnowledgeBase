  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 degrees to 44 degrees F.; and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 55 degrees to 59 degrees F., if without an O horizon. The depth to bedrock is more than 40 inches. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 16 inches thick. The base saturation of the mollic epipedon is about 60 to 75 percent and of the argillic horizon, about 65 to 80 percent. The organic matter in the upper 7 inches has a C:N ratio of 13.5 to 18.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. The pH is 5.8 to 6.8.\nThe Bt and E horizon contains irregular splotches and thin subhorizons of lighter colored A2 horizon material immediately above the lamellae. The B horizon material is brown to pale brown or light brown in 10YR or 7.5YR hue and is loam to coarse sandy loam, which may be gravelly. The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon has less than 18 percent clay and less than 35 percent coarse fragments. Clay films are few to common and thin on peds, in pores, and as bridges but are more distinct in the lamellae. The B horizon material ranges from moderate to weak, very fine to medium, subangular blocky structure and from pH 5.7 to 6.8. Brown (7.5YR 5/3 or 10YR 5/3) or reddish brown (5YR 4/3) horizontal, wavy lamellae 3 to 20 mm. thick are in the Bt and E horizon, and they commonly contain more clay than the adjacent material.\nThe Cr layer is commonly more acid than the solum and ranges from pH 5.4 to 6.5. Roots penetrate the more weathered portion but are mostly concentrated in fracture planes."

Bassel soils have neutral or mildly alkaline sola, gravelly sandy clay loam Bt horizons, and Bk horizons. Bryan, Coski, and Suttler soils lack an argillic horizon. Burgess and Kanlee soils have a C:N ratio in the upper 7 inches of less than 13.5 and have more than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Burgess soils have more than 80 percent base saturation in the Bt horizon. Kanlee soils have a mean summer soil temperature at depth of 20 inches warmer than 59 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The soils are on dominantly broad ridges, side slopes, toe slopes, benches, and saddles in strongly dissected uplands. Slopes range from 5 to 50 percent. The soils are most common in northerly slopes. The elevations range from 4,700 feet where the aspect is northerly to 6,500 feet or higher. The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from quartz monzonite, granodiorite, and related granitic bedrock. The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 35 inches, including 8 to 15 feet of snowfall. The average freeze-free period ranges from about 30 to 80 days."
