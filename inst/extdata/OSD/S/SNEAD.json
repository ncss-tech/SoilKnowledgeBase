  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 40 inches and depth to a paralithic contact  ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 12 inches to the upper limit of the partly weathered shale.  The solum is slightly acid or neutral in the upper part and ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline in the lower part.  Some pedons are stony.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay or silty clay loam but the range includes silt loam with 20 to 27 percent clay. Some pedons are stony or flaggy.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 3, 4, or 5; and chroma of 1 through 6 and is mottled. It is silty clay or clay or the flaggy or channery analogues.  Very dark gray (10YR 3/1) and black (10YR 2/1) stains or streaks typically are in the upper part.\nThe C horizon has the same range of texture and color as the B horizon."

The soils formed in residuum weathered from calcareous, clayey, gray shales, and thin interbedded limestone.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 40 inches."
