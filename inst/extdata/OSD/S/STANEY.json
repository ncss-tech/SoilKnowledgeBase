  "OVERVIEW": "The Staney series consists of very deep, very poorly drained organic soils that formed in partially decomposed sedges.  Staney soils are on nearly level marsh areas along rivers and streams.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 100 inches and mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  The soil is never frozen in most years below 2 inches due to maritime influence.  Within the control section, layers of fine gravel, sand and silt of non-volcanic origin range in thickness from 2 to 5 inches.  Hue of the organic material is 5YR or 7.5YR, value moist ranges from 2 through 4 and chroma moist from 1 through 4.  Chroma tends to be 1 or near neutral at a depth of 4 feet and below.  The reaction throughout the profile is extremely or very strongly acid.  pH ranges from 4.0 to 5.0 (0.01M CaCl2)), with some organic horizon in each profile having a pH of 4.5 or higher."

The climate is cool and humid with average annual rainfall greater than 100 inches.  The average annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  Elevation ranges from 100 to 300 feet."

Karta, Kupreanof, Tolstoi and Ulloa soils are well drained mineral soils of uplands.  Kina soils are dominantly hemic material. Kogish soils are dominantly sphagnum.  Tonowek and Tuxekan soils are well drained mineral soils with gravelly substrata on alluvial plains.  Wadleigh soils are somewhat poorly drained mineral soils on footslopes."
