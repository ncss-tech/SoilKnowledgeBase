The upper 14 to 37 inches of the particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.20 to 1.45 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 45 percent, including 10 to 20 percent sand-size ash 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.10 to 0.40 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent, and an apparent field estimated clay content of 3 to 8 percent. The lower part of the particle-size control section has 0 to 20 percent volcanic glass and 1 to 4 percent clay. The control section averages 71 to 95 percent sand and 3 to 15 percent gravel. Depth to loamy sands textures is 14 to 30 inches and depth to sands is 14 to 37 inches.\nThe Ap horizon value is 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist. The chroma is 2 or 3 dry or moist.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sanbee soils are on kames, terraces, and in outwash channels. Elevation is 1,300 to 2,800 feet. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Sanbee soils formed in glaciofluvial mixed with loess and with volcanic ash primarily from the G and B eruptions of Glacier Peak 12,750 to 11,250 years ago, overlying sandy glacial outwash. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches and average annual air temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. Average January air temperature is about 27 degrees F., average July air temperature is about 71 degrees F., and frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."

Delrio soils are in outwash channels, depressions, swales, and sideslopes of glaciated plateaus, have a mollic epipedon, and do not have loamy sands or sands within the particle-size control section. Quincy soils are on dunes and terraces, have less than 30 percent volcanic glass in the upper particle size control section, and do not have a cambic horizon. Strat soils are on glacial outwash plains and outwash terraces and are loamy-skeletal. Touhey soils are on side slopes and toe slopes of undulating till plains on plateaus and are moderately deep to cemented duripan. Tubspring soils are on kames and terraces and in outwash channels."
