  "OVERVIEW": "The Sanbee series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils. They formed in glaciofluvial outwash, volcanic ash and loess over sandy glacial outwash. They are on kames and terraces on glaciated plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and average annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

Sanbee soils formed in glaciofluvial mixed with loess and with volcanic ash primarily from the G and B eruptions of Glacier Peak 12,750 to 11,250 years ago, overlying sandy glacial outwash. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches and average annual air temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. Average January air temperature is about 27 degrees F., average July air temperature is about 71 degrees F., and frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."

Delrio soils are in outwash channels, depressions, swales, and sideslopes of glaciated plateaus, have a mollic epipedon, and do not have loamy sands or sands within the particle-size control section. Quincy soils are on dunes and terraces, have less than 30 percent volcanic glass in the upper particle size control section, and do not have a cambic horizon. Strat soils are on glacial outwash plains and outwash terraces and are loamy-skeletal. Touhey soils are on side slopes and toe slopes of undulating till plains on plateaus and are moderately deep to cemented duripan. Tubspring soils are on kames and terraces and in outwash channels."
