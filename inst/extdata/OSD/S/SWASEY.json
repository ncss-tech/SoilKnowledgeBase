These soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section 75 to 80 percent of the time during the period the soil temperature is warmer than 41 degrees F.\nThe depth to basalt bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The combined thickness of the E and Btn horizons ranges from 8 to 12 inches.  Exchangeable sodium is estimated to range from 20 to 50 percent.\nThe E horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is strongly or very strongly alkaline.\nThe Btn horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam with 28 to 35 percent clay.  This horizon has weak fine medium prismatic structure that parts to moderate very fine subangular blocky structure.  It has common to many this clay films on faces of peds.\nThe C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline."

The Benally, Highrock, Leebench, Leeko, Pizene, Recapture, Rusty, Terlco, and Uffens soils are more than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  The Fajada, Hadden, and Muff soils have a paralithic contact between 20 and 40 inches.  The Benally and Fajada soils have layers of gypsum accumulation in the lower part of the profile.  The Hadden soil has a calcic horizon and hue of 7.5YR and redder."
