  "OVERVIEW": "The Southpac series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from andesite.  Southpac soils are on mountain or plateau back slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
