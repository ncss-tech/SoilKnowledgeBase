The soil moisture control section (10 to 30 inches) is dry from July 15th to November 1st (107 days) and is moist in all parts from December 1st to May 15th.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from April 15th to December 1st and exceeds 47 degrees F from May 15th to November 15th.  Particle-size control section averages 20 to 27 percent clay.  Rock fragments on the surface and within the A horizon range from 15 to 25 percent stones, 5 to 30 percent cobbles and 15 to 35 percent gravel.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 75 percent.  Clay content increases with depth.\nThe A horizon dry color is 7.5YR 4/4, 5/2, 5/4; 5YR 4/3 or 5/3.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/2; 5YR 3/3 or 3/4.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe BAt horizon dry color is 7.5YR 4/4 or 5/4.  Moist color is 5YR 3/3, 3/4 or 4/4.  Texture is very gravelly loam or very cobbly loam with 15 to 18 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 40 to 55 percent.\nThe Bt1 and Bt2 horizons dry colors are 5YR 4/4, 5/4 or 6/4.
