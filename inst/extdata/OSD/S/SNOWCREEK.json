  "OVERVIEW": "The Snowcreek series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from marine basalt and associated volcanics on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 60 to 90 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 55 inches and average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The mean winter soil temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The upper 7 to 12 inches of the solum has a moist bulk density of 0.85 to 1.00 g/cc and an acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1 to 2 percent.  The particle-size control section has 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume and 8 to 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and 1 through 3 moist.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 dry and moist.  It is extremely gravelly sandy loam or extremely cobbly sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately or slightly acid."
