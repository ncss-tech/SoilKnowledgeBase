The upper 7 to 12 inches of the solum has a moist bulk density of 0.85 to 1.00 g/cc and an acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1 to 2 percent.  The particle-size control section has 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume and 8 to 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and 1 through 3 moist.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 dry and moist.  It is extremely gravelly sandy loam or extremely cobbly sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately or slightly acid."
