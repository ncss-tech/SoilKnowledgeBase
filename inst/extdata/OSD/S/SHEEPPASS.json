  "OVERVIEW": "The Sheeppass series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite. Sheeppass soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",

Precipitation is greatest in the winter with lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to Great Basin. The mean annual precipitation is 175 to 225 millimeters; mean annual air temperature is 9 to 13 degrees C. (48 to 55 degrees F.), and the frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."
