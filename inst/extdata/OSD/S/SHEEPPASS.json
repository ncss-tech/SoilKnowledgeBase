  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sheeppass soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 15 to 75 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite. Elevations are 1,220 to 2,100 meters (4,000 to 6,900 feet). The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, intermittently moist summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to Great Basin. The mean annual precipitation is 175 to 225 millimeters; mean annual air temperature is 9 to 13 degrees C. (48 to 55 degrees F.), and the frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."
