Thin zones with greater than 90 percent rock fragments (fragmental material) less than 13 cm thick also may be present. Pararock fragments may occur as small pieces (paragravel or parachanners) of soft phyllite or schist.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: 18 to 25 percent.\nRock fragments: 50 to 75 percent when mixed with the surface rock fragments, mainly channers; lithology of fragments is phyllite, schist, or similar metamorphic rocks\nA horizon\nHue: 10YR through 5Y.\nValue: 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma: 2 through 4.\nTexture: Silt loam or loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Blacktop soils are dominated by gravel, cobbles, and stones in the particle-size control section. Cadrina soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 10 degrees C and have fragments of sandstone or shale in the control section.  Pintwater soils are 25 to 50 cm deep and have Bkq horizons. Singatse soils average 5 to 15 percent clay and are dominated by gravel. Tsaya soils are intermittently moist in some part of soil moisture control section during July-September, and lithology of fragments in the profile is mainly sandstone and shale."
