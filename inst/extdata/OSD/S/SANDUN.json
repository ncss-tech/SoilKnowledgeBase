    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in loess, volcanic ash, and glacial outwash and slope alluvium derived from dunite.  Sandun soils are in a marine climate with cool, moist summers and cold, wet winters.  Snow cover lasts from December through March.  Mean annual precipitation is 70 to 90 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 32 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 59 degrees F, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 140 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  This draft reflects a change in classification from sandy-skeletal, serpentinitic, frigid Andic Xerochrepts to sandy-skeletal, serpentinitic, frigid Typic Haplorthods.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a cambic horizon from 3 to 24 inches dominated by amorphous material and 40 to 80 percent rock fragments,  dominantly dunite in the particle-size control section.  The spodic horizon does not meet chemical criteria for a spodic horizon, but does meet micro morphological for a spodic horizon, but does meet micro morphological criteria, i.e. cracked coatings and silt-sized and larger pellets.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
