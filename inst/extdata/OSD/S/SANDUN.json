  "OVERVIEW": "The Sandun series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in loess, volcanic ash, and glacial outwash derived from dunite.  Sandun soils are on outwash terraces, terrace escarpments and on mountain footslopes and have slopes of 5 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 80 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a cambic horizon from 3 to 24 inches dominated by amorphous material and 40 to 80 percent rock fragments,  dominantly dunite in the particle-size control section.  The spodic horizon does not meet chemical criteria for a spodic horizon, but does meet micro morphological for a spodic horizon, but does meet micro morphological criteria, i.e. cracked coatings and silt-sized and larger pellets."
