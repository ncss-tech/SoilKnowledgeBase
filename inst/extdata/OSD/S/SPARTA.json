  "OVERVIEW": "The Sparta series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in sandy outwash that has been reworked by wind. These soils are on nearly level to very steep treads and risers on stream terraces in river valleys, outwash terraces, outwash plains, and dune fields.  Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
