  "OVERVIEW": "The Stu series consists of shallow, well drained soils with moderate permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from lacustrine deposits. Slopes range from 50 to 90 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the average annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
