These soils are usually moist but are dry between depths at 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid throughout.  The mantle of volcanic ash ranges from 14 to 30 inches thick.  The upper part of the 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.65 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.   The lower part of the particle-size control section is 35 to 60 percent granitic rock fragments by weighted average.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is ashy loam or ashy fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have a bouldery surface layer.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is ashy loam, ashy fine sandy loam or ashy silt loam with 0 to 30 percent granitic rock fragments including 0 to 20 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones.\nThe BC horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.  It is gravelly ashy loam or gravelly ashy sandy loam and is 10 to 25 percent granitic gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe 2CB and 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 6 to 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly loamy sand, extremely gravelly loamy sand, very stony loamy sand, extremely stony loamy sand or very cobbly loamy sand. It is 20 to 55 percent granitic gravel, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 25 percent stones.  The 2CB, when present, is very gravelly sandy loam in the upper few inches."

Domkey soils are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days and is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction in the upper part of the particle-size control section.  Parmenter soils are coarsely stratified and contain rock fragments of mixed mineralogy which include volcanic rocks, schist, phyllite, and granitic rock."

Elevations range from 2,500 to 5,000 feet.  These soils formed in glacial till from granitic rocks overlain by a mantle of volcanic ash.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 25 inches.  The average January temperature is about 22 degrees F, average July temperature is about 65 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season (32 degrees F) is 90 to 120 days."

Manley and Resner soils have a cryic temperature regime. Manley soils are on the upper slopes of foothills and mountains.  Resner soils are on outwash terraces, terrace escarpments and mountain footslopes and toeslopes.  Nevine soils are ashy over loamy-skeletal and are on moraines, foothills and mountains.  Mineral soils are loamy-skeletal, are underlain by granitic bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches, and are on mountainsides and ridges."
