The\nmean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F.  Depth\nto bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the\nmollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has a moist value of 2 or 3 and moist chroma\nof 2 or 3.  The reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nRock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent and are mostly\nstones and cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon has dry value of 4 to 6, moist value of 3 or\n4, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  Structure grade is\nmoderate or strong, and structure type is angular or\nsubangular blocky.  Reaction is mildly or moderately\nalkaline.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent and\nare mostly stones and cobbles.  Clay percentage is 40 to 60.\nThe Bk horizon has dry value of 6 or 7, moist value of 4 or\n5, and dry chroma of 3 or 4.
