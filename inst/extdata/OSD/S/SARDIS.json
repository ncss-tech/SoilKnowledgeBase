The Adler, Arkabutla, Belden, Cascilla, Chenneby, Chewacla, Commerce, Lobelville, Mooresville, Oaklimeter, and Ouachita series are in closely related families. Adler and Oaklimeter soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section. In addition, Adler soils as well as the Arkabutla, Belden, and Commerce soils do not have a cambic horizons. Chenneby soils have mixed mineralogy. Chewacla, Lobelville, and Mooresville soils have more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. Cascilla and Ouachita soils do not have aquic conditions within a depth of 24 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sardis soils are on level to nearly level flood plains and low terraces. They formed in loamy alluvium along streams draining areas of acid, sandstone, siltstone, and shale from the Ouachita Mountains; MLRA 119, and areas of loamy to clayey Tertiary sediments from the Western Coastal Plain; MLRA 133B. These soils are subject to occasional or frequent flooding. The climate is warm and humid with mean annual rainfall of about 49 inches and mean annual temperature of about 63 degrees F."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series was updated in 2004 to allow iron accumulations to be present in the A horizon, and it was clarified that the water table is not perched.  The diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the type location pedon include:\nOchric epipedon--0 to 7 inches (Ap horizon)\nCambic horizon--7 to 56 inches (Bw horizons)\nIrregular organic carbon distribution--7 to 50 inches (Bw horizons)\nAquic conditions--12 to 24 inches (Bw2 horizon)\nThese soils were formerly mapped as the Chenneby series and would have been classified in the Alluvial great soil group."
