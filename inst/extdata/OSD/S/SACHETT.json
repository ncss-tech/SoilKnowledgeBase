  "OVERVIEW": "The Sachett series consists of shallow excessively drained soils that formed in material weathered from granite.  Sachett soils are on mountain side slopes and ridges and have slopes of 5 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 28 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the paralithic contact is 10 to 20 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 25 to 30 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is about 38 to 42 degrees F.  Base saturation on a weighted average basis in the A horizon ranges from 30 to 50 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR value of 3 through 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  The surface layer is gravelly or cobbly loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand.  Rock fragments range from 25 to 40 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hues of 10YR, or 7.5YR, values of 4 through 6 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  The Bw horizon ranges from very gravelly or cobbly sandy loam or loamy sand.  Rock fragments in the B horizon ranges from 40 to 80 percent.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered granite (grus).  When excavated this grus becomes strong brown extremely gravelly sand or strong brown extremely gravelly loamy sand.  The gravel size fractions range from 1/8 inch to 1 1/2 inches in diameter and is 80 to 90 percent of this horizon."
