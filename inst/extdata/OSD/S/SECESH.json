  "OVERVIEW": "The Secesh series consists of very deep, well drained soils on floodplains, stream terraces, and footslopes. They formed in about 2 feet of loamy alluvium and the underlying cherty residuum or alluvium from limestone and sandstone. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 44 inches.",

It is neutral to strongly acid in the A horizon and moderately to very strongly acid in the Bt and lower horizons.\nThe A, Ap, and AB horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 2 to 4. It typically is loam, but ranges to fine sandy loam and silt loam.\nThe BE, Bt, 2Bt, 3Bt, or 4Bt horizons have hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. They are silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam, or their gravelly analogs in the Bt and the nongravelly to extremely gravelly or very cobbly analogues of silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy clay in the 2Bt.\nSome pedons have a 2C horizon with colors similar to the 2Bt horizon. It is gravelly to extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, or loamy sand."
