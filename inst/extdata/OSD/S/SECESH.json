Chert gravel ranges from 0 to about l5 percent in the A and upper B horizons, l0 to 35 percent in the lower Bt horizons, l0 to 50 percent in the upper part of the 2Bt horizon, and l0 to 80 percent in the lower horizons. Chert cobbles are 0 to l0 percent above the 2Bt horizon, 0 to l5 percent in the upper 2Bt horizon, and 0 to 35 percent in the lower horizons. It is neutral to strongly acid in the A horizon and moderately to very strongly acid in the Bt and lower horizons.\nThe A, Ap, and AB horizons have hue of 7.5YR or l0YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 2 to 4. It typically is loam, but ranges to fine sandy loam and silt loam.\nThe BE, Bt, 2Bt, 3Bt, or 4Bt horizons have hue of l0YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. They are silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam, or their gravelly analogs in the Bt and the nongravelly to extremely gravelly or very cobbly analogues of silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy clay in the 2Bt.\nSome pedons have a 2C horizon with colors similar to the 2Bt horizon. It is gravelly to extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, or loamy sand."

The mean annual precipitation ranges from 37 to 45 inches, and the average annual temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F."
