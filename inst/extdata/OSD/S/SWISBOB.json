These soils formed in alluvium from welded tuff over lacustrine deposits. The climate is dry-subhumid with cool moist winters and warm dry summers but, occasionally moist in the upper part for 10 to 20 days (July through August) due to summer convection storms. The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., mean summer temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 450 mm, with most of it as snow."
