  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 to 55 degrees F.  The soils are usually dry but are moist during the winter season and in some part of the soil between depths of 8 and 24 inches for a period equal to more than 1/4 of the time that the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. The soils range from very strongly alkaline to moderately alkaline.  The percentage of exchangeable sodium decreases from the upper 10 inches to the underlying subhorizon.  The 10- to 40- inch control section is very fine sandy loam, silt loam or loam and has less than 18 percent clay, less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand and no rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches and typically 10 feet or more.\nThe A and AC horizons have value of 5.5 through 7 dry, 3.5 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  The A horizon is strongly or very strongly alkaline.  Under irrigation the surface may become sodic and noncalcareous.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.\nThe duripan is strongly cemented to indurated but is indurated in some part and depth to the pan ranges from about 20 to 40 inches.  Although the pan ranges from 4 to 30 inches in thickness it is commonly 7 to 20 inches thick.  In some pedons there are a series of pans with friable horizons between pans.  Layers of volcanic ash commonly about 12 inches thick but ranging to several feet in thickness are just above or just below the pan in some pedons.  Also, in some pedons a small amount of mica is scattered throughout the profile, but the greatest amount is below the first pan."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Burke and Minidoka series.  Burke soils are mildly or moderately alkaline throughout and formed in shallow deposits of loess.  Minidoka soils have a calcic horizon, lack volcanic ash and are well drained."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stanfield soils are on nearly level low terraces and bottomlands at elevations of about 300 to 3,500 feet.  The soils formed in very deep loess-derived alluvium with an appreciable amount of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The climate is semiarid with mean annual precipitation of 8 and 12 inches, warm dry summers and cool, relatively moist winters.  The mean January temperature is 29 degrees F., mean July temperature is 70 degrees F., mean annual temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 120 to 195 days."

Powder soils are deep well drained bottomland soils lacking a duripan.  Ritzville and Shano soils are deep well drained upland soils lacking a duripan.  Umapine soils lack a duripan and are somewhat poorly drained."
