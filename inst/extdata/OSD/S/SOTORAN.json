  "OVERVIEW": "The Sotoran series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. Sotoran soils are on stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C.",
