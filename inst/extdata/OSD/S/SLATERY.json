Celeton soils also have 60 to 80 percent soft diatomaceous earth fragments in C horizon.  Oceanet soils have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 10 degrees C. and more than 50 percent sand.  Perlor soils have more than 50 percent sand. Somorent soils have 0 to 15 percent gravel in the particle-sizecontrol section."
