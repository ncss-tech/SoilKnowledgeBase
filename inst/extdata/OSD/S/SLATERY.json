  "OVERVIEW": "The Slatery series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from siltstone and related sedimentary rocks. Slatery soils are on hills and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",

Celeton soils also have 60 to 80 percent soft diatomaceous earth fragments in C horizon.  Oceanet soils have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 10 degrees C. and more than 50 percent sand.  Perlor soils have more than 50 percent sand. Somorent soils have 0 to 15 percent gravel in the particle-sizecontrol section."
