  "STATES": "NE,SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Selia series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy alluvium or eolian sands.  These soils are on bottom lands or in basins of the sandhills.  Slopes generally are less than 1 percent, but range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 51 centimeters (20 inches).  Mean annual air temperature is 10 degrees C. (50 degrees F.) at the type location.",
