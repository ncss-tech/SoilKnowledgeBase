  "OVERVIEW": "The Sueleros series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess derived from micaceous sandstone and siltstone over alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist.  Sueleros soils are on treads of strath terrace remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
