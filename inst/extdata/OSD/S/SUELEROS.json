They formed in loess derived from Tertiary micaceous sandstone and siltstone over alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,500 to 6,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."

Depolvo soils are fine-silty, have argillic horizons, and occur on adjacent higher portions of treads.  Jaconita soils are sandy-skeletal, have calcic horizons, and are on risers of strath terrace remnants.  Xenmack soils are fine-loamy, moderately deep to soft bedrock, and occur on risers of strath terrace remnants."
