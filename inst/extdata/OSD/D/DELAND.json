  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 80 inches.  Depth to the Bh horizon ranges from 50 to 75 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A and E horizons, very strongly acid to moderately acid in the BE horizon, and extremely acid to strongly acid in the Bh horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma 1 or 2; or it is neutral (N) with value of 2 to 4.  Texture is Texture is fine sand or sand throughout the solum.\nThe upper part of the E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is fine sand or sand throughout the solum.\nThe lower part of the E horizon has the same range of colors as the upper part.  Fine to coarse bodies or discontinuous streaks in shades of gray or white range from few to common but are not considered indicative of wetness; they are the color of the sand grains.  Accumulations (oxides) in shades of red, yellow, brown, or gray range from few to common, mostly along old root channels.\nThe BEh horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Few to common uncoated sand grains are in this horizon.  Texture is fine sand or sand throughout the solum.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 4; or it is neutral with value of 2.  It is moderately to strongly cemented below a depth of 80 inches.  Few to common uncoated sand grains are in the Bh horizon but sand grains are well coated with colloidal organic matter in the lower part of the Bh horizon.  Texture is fine sand or sand throughout the solum."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Duette and Hobe series are in the same family.  The moderately well drained Duette soils are on similar to lower positions.  The somewhat excessively drained Hobe soils are on similar positions in the flatwoods and have an argillic horizon within an 80 inch depth under the spodic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Deland soils are on sand hills on the low Coastal Plains in central Florida.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  They formed in thick beds of marine, eolian, or fluvial sediments.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from about 50 to 60 inches and the average annual air temperature ranges from 70 to 74 degrees F."

The excessively drained Astatula and Paola soils are on higher positions and are sandy throughout.  In addition, Paola soils have weakly expressed Spodic horizons.  The somewhat poorly drained Cassia soils are on lower positions and have Bh horizons within a depth of 30 inches.  Immokalee and Pomello soils are on lower positions and have Bh horizons within depths of 30 to 50 inches.  In addition, Immokalee soils are poorly drained and Pomello soils are somewhat poorly to moderately well drained.  The moderately well drained Tavares soils are on lower positions and are sandy throughout."

Also, some areas are used for homes with relatively large lots.  The natural vegetation is dominated by sand live oak, turkey oak, along with scattered sawpalmetto, and clumps of pineland threeawn, prickly pear, and broomsedge bluestem."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 55 inches (the A, E1, E2, E3, and E4 horizons).\nSpodic horizon - the zone from a depth of 55 inches to a depth of more than 130 inches (the Bh1, Bh2, Bh3, and Bh4 horizons).\nThe water table is below depths of 72 inches; however, there is a perched water table on the strongly cemented layers below depths of 80 inches in the spodic horizon.  The water table fluctuates between depths of about 75 to 90 inches during periods of high rainfall\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Data is available on a pedon sampled with number S76FL127-28(1-9).  Characterization data was obtained from the University of Florida and engineering test data from the Florida Department of Transportation.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
