  "OVERVIEW": "The Deland series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on low, broad, sand hills.  They formed in thick beds of marine, eolian, or fluvial sediments on the lower Coastal Plain.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.",

Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A and E horizons, very strongly acid to moderately acid in the BE horizon, and extremely acid to strongly acid in the Bh horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma 1 or 2; or it is neutral (N) with value of 2 to 4.  Texture is Texture is fine sand or sand throughout the solum.\nThe upper part of the E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is fine sand or sand throughout the solum.\nThe lower part of the E horizon has the same range of colors as the upper part.  Fine to coarse bodies or discontinuous streaks in shades of gray or white range from few to common but are not considered indicative of wetness; they are the color of the sand grains.  Accumulations (oxides) in shades of red, yellow, brown, or gray range from few to common, mostly along old root channels.\nThe BEh horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Few to common uncoated sand grains are in this horizon.  Texture is fine sand or sand throughout the solum.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 4; or it is neutral with value of 2.  It is moderately to strongly cemented below a depth of 80 inches.  Few to common uncoated sand grains are in the Bh horizon but sand grains are well coated with colloidal organic matter in the lower part of the Bh horizon.  Texture is fine sand or sand throughout the solum."

The water table fluctuates between depths of about 75 to 90 inches during periods of high rainfall\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Data is available on a pedon sampled with number S76FL127-28(1-9).  Characterization data was obtained from the University of Florida and engineering test data from the Florida Department of Transportation.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
