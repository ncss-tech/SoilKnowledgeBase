The soils have a udic moisture regime but have a short dry period of less than 45 consecutive days during the summer.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry. it is loamy sand or sand,. This horizon has weak granular or subangular blocky structure.  Hand cobbles range from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe AC horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist. It is loamy sand or sand. Hard cobbles range from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It is sand, coarse sand or gravelly coarse sand and has up to 30 percent pebbles. Distinct reddish brown and gray mottles are common below depth of 40 inches in some pedons."

Abscota, Chute, Hodge, and Sarpy soils are calcareous in the lower part. Carver soils have chroma of 4 through 8 in the B horizon. Oakville soils have sola 18 to 40 inches thick and are slightly acid or neutral. Perks soils are slightly acid below depth of 8 to 36 inches. Penwood soils have hue of 5YR in the B horizon. Plainfield soils have sola 18 to 34 inches thick, have chroma of 3 or more throughout and are high in quartz and low in weatherable minerals.  Suncook soils are finer than medium sand in the control section. Tyner soils have dry value of 6 in the Ap horizon and typically have A2 horizons. Westport soils are fine sand or loamy fine sand and formed in dune sand on coastal beaches. Windsor soils have chroma of 4 through 8 in a subhorizon of the B horizon."

The soils formed in sandy alluvium derived mostly from rocks of the Cascade andesite formation. The climate is humid with an average annual precipitation of 60 to 70 inches. The average annual temperature is 50 degrees to 52 degrees F.; the average January temperature is 37 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 65 degrees F.; and the frost-free season is 100 to 200 days."
