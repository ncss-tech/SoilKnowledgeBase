  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 48 inches. Depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 54 inches. Rock fragments, mainly gravel and cobbles, range from none to 5 percent throughout the soil. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam. The horizon is friable or very friable, and reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid, unless limed.\nThe EB horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 through 5. It ranges from silt loam to fine sandy loam. Structure is subangular blocky or platy, and consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with value of 5 through 7 and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is similar to the EB horizon.\nThe E/B and B/E horizon have color and texture similar to the respective portion of the E or EB and Bt horizon above and below.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 and chroma from 2 through 4, with the lowest chroma being inherited from weathered dark shale. Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or silty clay loam. In some pedons, the Bt horizon has faint redoximorphic features in the lower part. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon that is slightly acid to moderately alkaline and has a lower clay content than the overlying Bt horizon.\nThe C horizon has colors similar to the Bt horizons. Texture ranges from very fine sand or silt to silty clay loam, some pedons having thin strata of finer or coarser texture including sand and gravel below depths of 4 feet. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Dunkirk soil is the only series in the same family.\nThe Allard, Amboy, Collamer, Hudson, and Unadilla series are similar soils in related families. Allard, Amboy, and Unadilla soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Collamer soils have distinct or prominent redoximorphic features in the upper part of the B horizons. Hudson soil have more than 35 percent clay in the B horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dunkirk soils developed in glacio-lacustrine deposits dominated by silt, very fine sand, and clay. These soils are on lake plains and along lower valley sides in major valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent, with the more sloping areas being prominently dissected. Surface shape is convex. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 44 inches, and the growing season is from 130 to 180 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Allard, Amboy, Arkport, Canandaigua, Collamer, Honeoye, Howard, Hudson, Madrid, Niagara, Ontario, Palmyra, and Unadilla soils. Allard, Amboy, Arkport, Colonie, Hudson, and Unadilla soils are associated on nearby lake-plain landscapes but lack a fine-silty particle size control section. Moderately well drained, Collamer soils, somewhat poorly drained Niagara soils, and poorly and very poorly drained Canandaguia soils form a drainage sequence with Dunkirk soils. Honeoye, Madrid and Ontario soils formed in glacial till on associated uplands. Howard and Palmyra soils formed in glacial outwash deposits on nearby terraces."
