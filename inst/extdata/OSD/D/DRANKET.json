  "OVERVIEW": "The Dranket series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash derived from dacite and residuum derived from basalt.  Dranket soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
