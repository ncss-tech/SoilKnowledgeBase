  "OVERVIEW": "The Dixie series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from intermediate igneous and sedimentary rocks.  These soils are on fan terraces and hill footslopes and have slopes of 2 to 40 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
