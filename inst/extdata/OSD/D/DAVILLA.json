  "OVERVIEW": "The Davilla series consists of very deep to loamy alluvium, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age derived from mudstone.  These nearly level soils are on treads of Pleistocene stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 938 mm (36.92 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 20.2 degrees C (68.4 degrees F).",

The soil is massive and hard when dry. (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon: 25 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in). (Bt1, Bt2, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, Btg4 horizons)\nRedoximorphic concentrations: 25 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in). (Bt1, Bt2, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, and Btg4 horizons)\nRedoximorphic depletions: 25 to 86 cm (10 to 34 in). (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nOther features: Most pedons are underlain with beds of sand and/or gravel below a depth of 3 m (10 ft).\nADDITIONAL DATA: TAMU/KSSL Data from 4 pedons shows the weighted average clay content of the control section ranges from 28 to 34 percent.
