These soils were previously included with the Crockett series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 25 to 75 cm (10 to 30 in) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in). The soil is massive and hard when dry. (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon: 25 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in). (Bt1, Bt2, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, Btg4 horizons)\nRedoximorphic concentrations: 25 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in). (Bt1, Bt2, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, and Btg4 horizons)\nRedoximorphic depletions: 25 to 86 cm (10 to 34 in). (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nOther features: Most pedons are underlain with beds of sand and/or gravel below a depth of 3 m (10 ft).\nADDITIONAL DATA: TAMU/KSSL Data from 4 pedons shows the weighted average clay content of the control section ranges from 28 to 34 percent.  However, the field texture method suggests a fine family.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
