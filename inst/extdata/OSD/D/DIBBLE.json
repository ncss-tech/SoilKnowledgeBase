  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic or densic contact of sedimentary rock or densic material is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 62 to 65 degrees F. and the soil temperature is above 47 degrees F. except for brief periods in January.  The soils usually are moist all of the time in some or all parts between depths of 4 to 12 inches from about November until about May and usually are dry the rest of the time.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 5/3, 5/4; 2.5Y.5/4, 6/4.  Moist value is 4 or more.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  Many pedons are massive, but structure is weak platy or subangular blocky in some pedons.  This horizon is hard or very hard and is neutral to medium acid.  The boundary between the A horizon and the Bt horizon is clear or gradual or a transitional horizon is present.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 4/4, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6, 7/6; 2.5Y 6/ or 5/4.  Moist value is dominantly one or two units darker than the dry value.  This horizon is heavy clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay and has 35 to 45 percent clay and 15 to 20 percent material coarser than very fine sand.  It is massive or has weak to moderate subangular blocky or prismatic structure.  The horizon is neutral to medium acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dibble soils are on undulating gentle to very steep fan remnants and hills and have slopes of 2 to 75 percent.  They formed in material weathered from silty densic material, shale or sandstone. Elevations are 100 to 2,500 feet.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 40 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 60 to 65 degrees F.; average January temperature is about 43 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 77 degrees F.  Freeze-free season is about 150 to 270 days."
