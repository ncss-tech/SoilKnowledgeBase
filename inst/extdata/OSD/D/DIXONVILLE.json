  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 51 to 56 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry between 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days during the summer months within MLRA 2 but ranges to 90 days in MLRA 5. Depth weakly or moderately cemented basalt bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. The solum is 20 to 40 inches thick. The pscs has 40 to 55 percent clay, 0 to 35 percent rock fragments and 0 to 10 percent pararock fragments.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 36 inches thick.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry. Texture is silty clay loam with 27 to 40 percent clay. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay with 30 to 50 percent clay. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is clay or silty clay with 40 to 55 percent clay. It has 0 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent paragravel. A stone line is present at the upper boundary of the Bt horizon in some pedons. A few stones are in the lower part of the Bt horizon in some pedons. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid in the upper part of the Bt horizon and moderately acid to neutral in the lower part."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Dixonville soils are on gently sloping to steep hills bordering the mountainous uplands at elevations of 300 to 2,000 feet. Slopes are 3 to 60 percent. The soils formed in clayey colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from basalt of the Fisher and Siletz River Volcanics formations. The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and warm, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches. The mean annual temperature is 49 to 55 degrees F. The average January temperature is 38 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 64 to 68 degrees F. The frost-free season is 160 to 235 days."

Bellpine soils lack mollic epipedons and occur over sedimentary bedrock. Hazelair soils have iron depletions within 30 inches of the surface and occur on concave parts of the hillslope. Jory and Price soils are very deep and occur on hills at higher elevations. MacDunn soils are deep and occur on hills at higher elevations. Nekia soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches and occur on hills at higher elevations. Philomath soils are 12 to 20 inches to a paralithic contact. Witzel soils are 12 to 20 inches to a lithic contact. They occur on convex parts of the hillslope. Panther soils have a chroma of 2 and distinct redoximorphic concentrations in the lower part of the mollic epipedon. The occur on concave parts of the hillslope. Ritner soils are clayey-skeletal and occur on convex parts of the hillslope. Witham soils have redoximorphic features at depths of 16 to 30 inches and occur on foot slopes and toe slopes. Gellatly soils occur on linear or concave parts of the hillslope."
