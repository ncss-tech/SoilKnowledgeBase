  "OVERVIEW": "The Dutchflat series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed igneous and metamorphic alluvium.  Dutchflat soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",
