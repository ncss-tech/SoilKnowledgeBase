  "OVERVIEW": "The Dokie series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone and quartzite rock.  Dokie soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 25 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
