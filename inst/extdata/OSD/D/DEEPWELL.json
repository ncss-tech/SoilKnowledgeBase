  "OVERVIEW": "The Deepwell series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, soils on sand dunes on basin floors and lake terraces.  These soils formed in windblown rhyolitic volcanic ash.  They have slopes of 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm, much of it as snow, and the mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth of the soil is 152 cm or more.  The ash content ranges from 60 to 100 percent by weight.  The soil is usually dry from mid-May to mid-November, and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the time.  The soil temperature is above 5 degrees C from April 1 to December 20, and is above 8 degrees C from April 15 to November 30.  Summer and fall thunderstorms occur, but are sporadic and usually do not wet the control section.  The mean annual soil temperature is 8.3 to 11.1 degrees C.  The sand particles are poorly graded due to the eolian origin.\nThe C horizon color is 10YR 6/2, 7/1 or 7/3.   Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 5/2 or 5/3.  Textures are sand, fine sand or loamy fine sand.  Base saturation is 90 to 100 percent.  The soil reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."

The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, much of it as snow, and the mean annual temperature is 7.2 to 10.0 degrees C.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Deepwell soils have an aridic moisture regime bordering on xeric.  Cold soil temperatures in winter prevent their meeting all the xeric moisture regime requirements.\nTaxonomic Class:  Ashy, MESIC Xeric Torripsamments.\nMajor Diagnostic Horizons\n1.  Ochric epipedon\n1.1  Color values do not meet mollic criteria (10YR 7/1,7/2,\n7/3, 6/2).\n1.2  No structure\nOther Diagnostic Horizons or Soil Characteristics:\n1.  No diagnostic subhorizons because:\n1.1  There are no clay films, no structures and the profile has sandy textures.\n2.  Ash content is assumed to be 60 to 100 percent based on grain count analyses by SCS Lincoln Lab on the associated Alamedawell soil.\n3.  Soil textural control section averages sand or fine sand (hydrometer analysis by SCS Lincoln Lab); no loamy or very gravelly lenses present.\n4.  Soil moisture regime is aridic bordering on xeric.  The M.A.P. is 8 to 12 inches.  This is extrapolated from weather data at Mono Lake, Benton and Bishop.\n5.  The temperature regime is mesic.  M.A.S.T. is 8.3 to 11.1 degrees C.  This is extrapolated from actual soil temperature transect data collected over the past years using 12 month averages and Rod Arkley's formula.\n6.  The soil is usually dry from mid-May to mid-November, and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the time.  The soil temperature is above 5.0 degrees C. from April 1 to December 20, and is above 8.3 degrees C. from April 15 to November 30.\nThe particle-size control section is from 25 to 100 cm (part of the C2 horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
