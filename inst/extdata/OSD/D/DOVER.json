  "OVERVIEW": "The Dover series consists of deep, well drained soils on uplands.  They are nearly level to moderately steep and formed in glacial till.  Dover soils typically have very dark brown and dark brown gravelly loam and fine sandy loam, reddish brown gravelly fine sandy loam B horizons, and grayish brown gravelly sandy loam C horizons.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum ranges from 16 to 36 inches; the depth to carbonates is the same or slightly less.  Depth to bedrock is more than 40 inches and normally more than 60 inches.  Rock fragments range from 3 to 35 percent throughout the soil with individual layers ranging up to 45 percent.  The soil is medium acid to neutral in the A horizon, slightly acid to mildly alkaline in the B horizon, and mildly or moderately alkaline in the C horizon.  Clay content of the control section ranges from 5 to 18 percent and sands coarser than very fine are more than 30 percent of the section.\nThe Ap horizon has hues of 7.5YR or 10YR, values of 2 to 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It ranges from sandy loam to silt loam in the fine earth fraction.  It has weak to moderate structure.\nThe B horizons have hues of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, values of 3 through 5, and chromas of 3 to 6; at least one subhorizon is 2.5YR or 5YR.  The B horzons are sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.  They have very weak or weak blocky to moderate granular structure, and are friable to very friable.\nC horizons have hues of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, values of 4 through 7, and chromas of 2 through 6.  They are massive or have moderate platy structure and are friable to very firm.  They are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {

Grenville soils are high in dolomite.  Lenox soils have hues of 2.5Y or 5Y in the B horizon.  Nellis, Pequea, and Salter sols have hues of 7.5YR or yellower throughout the B horizon.\nThe Amenia, Benson, Farmington, Hogansburg, Pittsfield, and Stockbridge series are similar soils in related families. Amenia and Hogansburg soils have mottles with chromas of 2 or less wihtin a depth of 24 inches.  Benson and Farmington soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 20 inches. Pittsfield and Stockbridge soils lack carbonates within a depth of 40 inches."

Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent in gradient. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches; mean annual air temperature, from 44 degrees to 50 degrees F.; and mean growing season, from 125 to 180 days."
