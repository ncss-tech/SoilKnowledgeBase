    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 53 degrees F. The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days during the summer. The solum ranges from about 4 to 6 feet thick and depth to bedrock from 7 to 10 feet or more.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value closest to 2 moist in the upper part, 2 or 3 in the lower part (A3 horizon) and 2 or 3 dry and chroma of 2 or 3. It is clay loam or clay and commonly feels no finer than moderately fine in the field. It has 3 to 25 percent rock fragments. This horizon dominantly has strong granular or very fine or fine subangular blocky structure. It ranges from 7 to 10 inches thick.\nThe Bw horizon has value closest to 4 moist and 5 dry and chroma of 4 through 6. It is clay or silty clay with 40 to 50 percent clay and with 5 to 35 percent rock fragments above depth of 40 inches. Below depth of 40 inches it is very gravelly or cobbly and has 35 to 75 percent rock fragments."

Dement soils have less than 15 percent partially weathered sedimentary rock fragments in the solum, have hue as red as 5YR, and have A horizons with value of 3 moist and 5 dry. Enola, Headly, Hoquiam, Marty, Tebo and Tolke soils are all influenced with pyroclastic materials in some part and have apparent field textures coarser than fine, Kilowan soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Melby soils have ochric epipedons, lack hard unweathered rock fragments and have less than 15 percent partially weathered sedimentary rock fragments in the A and B2 horizons.  Snahopish soils have ochric epipedons, are gravelly throughout, have sola 24 to 36 inches thick, and are friable throughout."

On most burned over or cut-over areas, there are salal, salmonberry, thimbleberry, sword fern, and hemlock seedlings."
