  "OVERVIEW": "Disabel soils typically have weakly expressed, light brownish-gray platy A1 horizons, pale brown prismatic clay and silty clay B2t horizons, and light brownish-gray, loamy C horizons.  The soils are calcareous, at least in spots, throughout the profile, and are moderately and strongly alkaline in reaction.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually dry but are moist more than 1/4 of the time the soil temperature is more than 41 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 62 to 64 degrees F.  Mineralogy is montmorillonitic.\nThickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 54 inches.  The soils are usually calcareous throughout the profile, but range from noneffervescent to violently effervescent.  pH values range from 6.8 to 8.8, being lowest in the A1 and upper B horizons where noncalcareous, and highest in the lower B or C horizons.  Color of the A1 horizons includes hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 5.5 to 6.5 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3.  Structure ranges from weak to strong, thin to thick platy, or is massive.  Consistence ranges from soft or slightly hard.  Color of the B2t horizon includes hues of 10YR, values of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3.  Texture is predominantly silty clay or clay, but may include heavy silty clay loam or heavy clay loam.  When the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon is mixed, the weighted average clay content is greater than 35 percent.  Structure of the B2t horizon ranges from moderate or strong, medium or coarse prismatic or angular blocky, or thin to thick platy.  Few to common, very fine to medium lime segregations occur in the lower part.  Color of the C and IIC horizons includes hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3.  High chroma iron and low chroma manganese mottles can occur below 40 inches in unconformable lacustrine materials.  Weak silica-cementation may also occur at depths below 40 inches.  The C horizons consist of loamy or silty materials, while the IIC horizons consist of clayey materials."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Buckrake and Toney soils have been classified in the same family.  Buckrake soils differ by having 20 to 36 inch thick sola, distinct medium to very coarse lime segregations coating structural aggregates in the lower part of their Bt horizons, and hard bedrock at 20 to 54 inches.  Toney soils differ by having 2 to 4 inch A2 horizons and columnar B2t horizons.  Schamp and Short Creek soils are also similar.  Schamp soils differ by having mean annual soil temperatures greater than 47 degrees F., 20 to 36 inch thick, lime-free sola.  Short Creek soils differ by having 35 to 50 percent coarse fragments in their B2t horizons, and 40 to over 60 inch thick sola and depth to soft tuff bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Disabel soils are on smooth, nearly level to lacustrine terraces having slope gradients less than 2 percent.  They have developed in silty or loamy lacustrine sediments derived mainly from tuffs and basalts.  These soils occur at elevations of 4,500 to 5,000 feet in a cold, continental climate having an average annual precipitation of 8 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 44 degrees F."

Crutcher soils lack diagnostic subsurface horizons and have silty clay control sections.  Jessie Camp soils have very fine sandy loam cambic horizons and fine-silty control sections.  Ravendale soils have clay or silty clay control sections that contain slickensides.  Powley soils have mollic epipedons and indurated duripans."
