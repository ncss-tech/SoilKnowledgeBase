  "OVERVIEW": "The Dickerson series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone and siltstone.  Dickerson soils are on rounded ridgetops, foothills and mountains.  Slopes are 3 to 90 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches.",

The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F.  Depth to a lithic contact is 5 to 10 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay.  The soils is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel."

The soils formed in material weathered from medium and coarse grained sandstone, conglomerate sandstone and metavolcanic rocks.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F.
