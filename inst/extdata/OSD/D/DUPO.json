  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the buried soil is 20 to 40 inches.  Color, arrangement, and thickness of all horizons is quite variable.  Clay content averages 10 to 18 percent in the silty alluvium and averages 35 to 55 percent in the buried soils.  Sand content is less than 10 percent throughout the soil.  Reaction commonly is neutral or slightly acid, but ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline in some layers of some pedons.  Some pedons contain carbonates below a depth of 40 inches.\nThe upper part of the series control section (Ap or A) has value of 4 or 5 (6 or 7 dry) and chroma of 1 to 3.  In many undisturbed pedons the A horizon is stratified, and some strata have color value of 3.  Texture is silt loam or silt.  The second part of the control section (C) has value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 3.  The C horizon typically is stratified.  Texture dominantly is silt loam, but thin lenses of other textures are in some pedons.\nThe lower part of the control section (2Ab, 2Bgb, and 2Cg) has properties as follows:  The 2Ab horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam. Redoximorphic concentrations commonly have colors with hue redder than 10YR.\nThe 2Bgb and 2Cg horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR or more yellow hue, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Redoximorphic features with higher chroma and redder hues are common.  Texture is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam.  Clay content averages 35 to 55 percent but individual horizons or strata range to 60 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dupo soils are on flood plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in 20 to 40 inches of recent, light-colored, silty alluvium overlying dark, clayey soils.  These soils typically are subject to rare to frequent flooding from January to June, but in some areas the hazard of flooding is reduced by levees, locks and dams, and other flood-control structures.  Mean annual temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 36 to 44 inches, frost-free period is 170 to 210 days, and elevation is 340 to 450 feet above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arenzville, Beaucoup, Darwin, Haymond, Orion, Titus, Wabash, Wakeland, and Wilbur series.  The moderately well drained Arenzville and the somewhat poorly drained Orion soils have dark buried soils that contain less clay.  These soils are on similar parts of the flood plain nearby.  The poorly drained Beaucoup and Titus soils, and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Darwin and Wabash soils all have mollic epipedons and contain more clay in the upper part of the solum.  They are on lower parts of the flood plain nearby. Darwin, Titus, and Wabash soils are similar to the buried soils in the Dupo soils.  The well drained Haymond, the moderately well drained Wilbur, and the somewhat poorly drained Wakeland soils are closer to the bluffs or to the drainageways that provides the source of the recent silty alluvium.  Also, these soils do not have a dark buried soil or a strongly contrasting particle-size class."

This typical pedon was published in the Soil Survey of Randolph County, Illinois (1988) and was resampled and described to 80 inches for this revision.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include: Ochric epipedon - from the surface of the soil to a depth of 9 inches (Ap horizon).  Contrasting particle-size class - increase of about 25 percent absolute clay from a depth of 25 inches to 30 inches.  Redoximorphic features - throughout the soil\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
