The solum is neutral or mildly alkaline but in some pedons the C horizon is calcareous.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 or 3, moist and chroma of 2 through 4. It is loam, light sandy clay loam and has 20 to 35 percent gravel and 5 to 40 percent cobbles.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 6.

Most of these soils are on southerly aspects.  The soils formed in material weathered from interbedded shale and sandstone of the Pennsylvanian Formation. Annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 35 inches with peak periods in winter and late summer. Mean annual temperature is 38 degrees to 40 degrees F. and the summer temperature is 50 degrees F."
