    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Donica soils are on smooth to convex alluvial fans, lake terraces and fan remnants. They formed in alluvium derived from tuff, andesite, basalt, dacite, latite, and tuff breccia. Slopes range from 0 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 1,219 to 1,658 meters (4,000 to 5,440 feet). The climate is cool, continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. Average annual precipitation is 305 to 406 millimeters (12 to 16 inches). The mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C. (47 to 52 degrees F.); the frost-free period is 80 to 120 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Donica soils were formerly classified as Alluvial soils.\nIn 2006, this soil was reclassified based on optical grain counts of associated soils and updated to the most recent version of Soil Taxonomy. Previous classification was Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haploxerolls.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from 0 to 33 cm (0 to 13 inches) (A1, A2 horizons).\nCambic horizon - The zone from 33 to 74 cm (13 to 29 inches) (Bw horizon).\nVitritorrandic feature - All horizons in the upper 75 cm have more than 30 percent volcanic glass in the coarse silt to sand fraction.\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 inches) (A2, Bw, 2C horizons)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
