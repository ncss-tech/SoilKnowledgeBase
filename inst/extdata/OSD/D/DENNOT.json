The moisture control section is usually moist but is dry in all parts for more than 45 consecutive days within the 4 months following the summer solstice.  The soil moisture regime is xeric bordering on aridic.\nDepth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 18 inches thick.  Depth to the calcic horizon is 7 to 18 inches.  Calcium carbonate is 15 to 40 percent.  Rock fragments in the particle size control section range from 35 to 70 percent and are dominantly gravel but ranges to cobbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 to 3 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  The A horizon is 10 to 55 percent rock fragments.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline and ranges from slightly calcareous to strongly calcareous.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is very gravelly loam, very cobbly loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, gravelly loam and extremely cobbly fine sandy loam below 30 inches.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in alluvium, colluvium and residuum derived from conglomerate composed mainly of sandstone, limestone, and quartzite.  Elevations are 5,950 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual temperature is 35 to 45 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  Freeze-free period is 60 to 110 days."

Dagan soils have noncalcareous mollic epipedons.  Thatcher soils have an argillic horizon.  Gobine soils formed in deep loess deposits and contain less than 5 percent gravel in the particle size control section.  Gridge soils are shallow over sandstone.  Cutoff soils do not have a mollic epipedons.  Watkins Ridge soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section."
