The combined thickness of the A1 and B2t horizons is 23 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The mean annual summer temperature ranges from 60 to 66 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry for 50 to 85 consecutive days during the later part of the summer.  Rock fragments consist of pebbles and cobbles and range from 10 to 40 percent in the A1 horizon and from 0 to 20 percent in the B2t horizon.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  It ranges from loam to gravelly or cobbly loam.  This horizon is medium or slightly acid and ranges from 6 to 15 inches thick.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of  2 through 4 dry and moist.  It ranges from heavy clay loam to clay or silty clay and has 35 to 45 percent clay.  This horizon has weak or moderate , medium or coarse prismatic to weak through strong, fine through coarse subangular blocky structure that parts to moderate coarse granular in some subhorizons.  The B2t horizon has few to continuous, thin or moderately thick clay films.  It is medium acid to slightly acid and ranges from 10 to 25 inches thick.\nSoft weathered tuffaceous sandstone or andesite occurs at depths of 20 to 40 inches."
