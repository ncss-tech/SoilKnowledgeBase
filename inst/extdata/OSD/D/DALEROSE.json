  "OVERVIEW": "The Dalerose series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to hard sandstone bedrock.  The are well drained moderately permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone. Dalerose soils are on ridges and scarps slopes in the plains. Slope ranges from 3 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
