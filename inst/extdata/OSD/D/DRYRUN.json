  "OVERVIEW": "The Dryrun series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable in the top soil and upper subsoil, moderately slowly to slowly permeable in the lower subsoil and moderately rapid to rapidly permeable soils in the substratum. They formed in alluvial material washed down from surrounding mountains which covers the underlaying limestone residuum.  They occur on alluvial fans, fan terraces and along drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 54 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 50 inches.",

The reaction ranges from neutral to very strongly acid.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of  3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Texture in the fine earth fraction is silt loam or loam, and their gravelly or cobbly analogous. Cobble size rock fragments can range up to 15 percent.\nThe BE horizon when present has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Texture in the fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or their gravelly or cobbly analogous.  Cobble size rock fragments can range up to 10 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR , value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Texture in the fine earth fraction commonly is clay loam, sandy clay loam or loam, but includes loamy sand and silt loam, in the fine earth fraction. Some pedons have Bt horizons which exhibit some brittle characteristics. Cobble size rock fragments can range up to 15 percent, stone size rock fragments can range up to 5 percent and flagstone size rock fragments can range up to 10 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 8, and chroma of 4 through 8.
