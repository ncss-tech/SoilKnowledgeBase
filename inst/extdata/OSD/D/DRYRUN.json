    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater then 80 inches, and depth to limestone residuum is greater then 70 inches. Depth to redoximorphic features is greater than 24 inches.  Rock fragments are quartzitic sandstone, shale and limestone and range from 10 to 25 percent in the Ap and BE horizons, and 35 to 75 percent in the subsoil and substratum.  The reaction ranges from neutral to very strongly acid.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of  3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Texture in the fine earth fraction is silt loam or loam, and their gravelly or cobbly analogous. Cobble size rock fragments can range up to 15 percent.\nThe BE horizon when present has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Texture in the fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or their gravelly or cobbly analogous.  Cobble size rock fragments can range up to 10 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR , value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Texture in the fine earth fraction commonly is clay loam, sandy clay loam or loam, but includes loamy sand and silt loam, in the fine earth fraction. Some pedons have Bt horizons which exhibit some brittle characteristics. Cobble size rock fragments can range up to 15 percent, stone size rock fragments can range up to 5 percent and flagstone size rock fragments can range up to 10 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 8, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Texture in the fine earth fraction is commonly loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam and their gravelly and cobbly analogues, but also includes silt loam, and sandy loam."
