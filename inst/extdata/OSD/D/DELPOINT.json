The Cabbart and Yawdim soils have soft bedrock between 10 and 20 inches.  They are on summits and shoulder slopes above the Delpoint soils.  Kremlin, Rothiemay, and Yamacall soils are very deep and are on alluvial fans and terraces below the Delpoint soils."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records:  MT0271, MT0776.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - from 0 to 7 inches (A, Bw horizons); cambic horizon - from 3 to 17 inches (Bw horizon); horizon of lime accumulation - from 17 to 28 inches (Bk horizon); paralithic contact - at a depth of 28 inches (Cr horizon); particle-size control section - from 10 to 28 inches (Bw and Bk horizons).\nThe Delpoint series should be investigated in the future to determine if it typically does not have a calcic horizon.  The range in characteristics listed for the Bk horizon would allow the presence of a calcic horizon.  It is likely that series counterparts in the Haplocalcidic Haplustepts and Aridic Calciustepts subgroups may need to be written in the future to handle areas mapped as Delpoint that have calcic horizons.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
