  "OVERVIEW": "The Davtone series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from red sandstone.  Davtone soils are on mountains fans, drainageways, and hills.  Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
