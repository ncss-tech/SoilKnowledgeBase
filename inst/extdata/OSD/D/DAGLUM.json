  "OVERVIEW": "The Daglum series consists of deep and very deep, moderately well and well drained soils formed in clayey alluvium or residuum on foot slopes and swales on terraces and uplands.  These soils have slow or very slow permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",

It is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam or clay loam containing 35 to 60 percent clay.  It has strong columnar structure in the upper part grading to moderate or strong prismatic and blocky in the lower part.  The Btn horizon ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the upper part and slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline in the lower part.  The exchangeable sodium exceeds 15 percent or the sodium plus magnesium exceeds calcium plus hydrogen.  Salt crystals and some carbonate masses are in the lower part in some pedons.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.
