  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Soft sedimentary beds of shale, siltstone or fine grained sandstone are below depths of 40 inches.  Stony and saline phases are recognized.  Some pedons have Ab horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2.  It typically is clay loam or silty clay loam, but some is fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam or silty clay.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  It is moderately acid to neutral.  It has weak prismatic or blocky structure parting to weak or moderate platy.  In some tilled pedons all of the E horizon has been mixed with the Ap horizon.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam or clay loam containing 35 to 60 percent clay.  It has strong columnar structure in the upper part grading to moderate or strong prismatic and blocky in the lower part.  The Btn horizon ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the upper part and slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline in the lower part.  The exchangeable sodium exceeds 15 percent or the sodium plus magnesium exceeds calcium plus hydrogen.  Salt crystals and some carbonate masses are in the lower part in some pedons.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam, clay or silty clay. It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have salt or gypsum accumulations and some do not.  Some pedons have Byz, By or Bz horizons up to 10 inches thick.\nThe BC and C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  They are clay loam, silty clay, silty clay loam or clay.  They are slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have gypsum accumulations and some do not.  The C horizon is stratified in some pedons.  Texture of loam is allowed below a depth of 40 inches.  Soft sedimentary beds of shale, siltstone or fine grained sandstone are below depths of 40 inches in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Daglum soils are on level and nearly level terraces and on level to moderately steep uplands.  They are on foot slopes and swales.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in clayey alluvium or residuum from shale, siltstone, or fine grained sandstone.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 13 to 19 inches.  Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer."

Belfield and Rhoades soils are in complex with the Daglum series.  Belfield soils have interfingering of an E horizon into the Btn horizon and do not have strong columnar structure.  Rhoades soils have visible salts or gypsum within a depth of 16 inches.  None of the other soils have natric horizons.  They are on nearby terraces and uplands."
