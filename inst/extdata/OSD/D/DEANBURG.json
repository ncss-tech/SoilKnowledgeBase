    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness exceeds 60 inches. Depth  to alternating layers of E and Bt material, or horizons with a  significant decrease in clay content and having pockets or  discontinous bands of E material ranges from 30 to 50 inches Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid throughout, except for  surface layers that have been limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and  chroma of 3 or 4, except in some eroded areas the chroma ranges to  6. Texture is commonly clay loam or sandy clay loam in severely  eroded areas and ranges to loam and silt loam in areas where erosion is not severe.\nThe A horizon, in areas with slight erosion is 1 to 4 inches thick,  and has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silt loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, is 3 to 6 inches thick. It has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma 4 or 6. Texture is commonly loam or clay loam but ranges to silty clay loam or sandy clay loam.  Some pedons have high chroma mottles.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is sandy clay loam or sandy loam.\nThe 2E and Bt horizon consists of alternating layers of loamy sand or sand (E) and sandy loam or loamy sand lamella (Bt). The E material has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 6 or 8. Commonly the E layers range from several inches to several feet in thickness. The lamella have colors in shades of brown, yellow or rarely red. The lamella are mostly from 1/8 to 1/2 inches in thickness but range up to 2 inches thick. The E layers are continuous. The lamella are mostly discontinous. Both are nearly horizontal with abrupt, wavy boundaries."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bolivar, Liddieville, Pamunkey, Sandhill, Stiversville, and Toine series in the same family and the closely similar Cahaba, Dexter, Kalmia, Kempsville, Lexington, Maxton, Smithdale, and Suffolk series. Bolivar soils have a lithic contact within 60  inches. Liddieville and Pamunkey soils have solum thickness of less than 60 inches and in addition are not underlain by Coastal Plain sediments within a depth of 60 inches. Sandhill and Stiversville soils contain rock  fragments of weathered limestone. Toine soils are subject to  flooding and are not underlain by Coastal Plain sediments.  Cahaba, Kalmia, Kempsville, Maxton, and Suffolk soils have base saturation of less than 35 percent, and in addition, have siliceous mineralogy. Dexter and Lexington soils are fine-silty. Smithdale soils have siliceous mineralogy, are on dissected Coastal Plain uplands, and base saturation is less than 35 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Deanburg soils are on old fluvial terraces of Coastal Plain sediments that have been modified by wind and subsequently covered by a deposit of loess during the Pleistocene age. The climate is warm and humid. Near the type location the average annual temperature is about 60 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 51 inches."

Bibb, Iuka and Ochlockonee soils are coarse-loamy, poorly drained,  moderately well drained, and well drained soils on adjacent flood  plains. Freeland and Hatchie soils, on adjacent terraces, are  moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained soils that have  a fragipan. Guyton soils, on low terraces, are poorly drained.  Kinston soils, on nearby flood plains, are poorly drained.  Providence soils, on adjacent uplands, are moderately well drained  and have a fragipan."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Deanburg soils were formerly mapped in the Dexter and Lexington series. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon  are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a  depth of about 7 inches (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from about 7 inches to a depth of  about 40 inches (Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3 horizons). The lamella in the lower part of the solum are too few and do not have sufficient clay  increase to constitute an argillic horizon.\nSevere erosion - Nearly all areas of Deanburg soils have been cultivated for generations and the Ap horizon is now in subsoil material.  In many of these areas the overlying loess mantle has been removed by the severe erosion.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
