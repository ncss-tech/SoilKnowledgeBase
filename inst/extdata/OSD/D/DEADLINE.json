The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from schist or phyllite rock types of the Colebrooke Schist Formation.  Elevations are 200 to 3,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 130 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.
