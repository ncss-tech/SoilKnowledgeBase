  "OVERVIEW": "The Deadline series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from schist or phyllite rock types.  Deadline soils are on broad ridgetops and side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
