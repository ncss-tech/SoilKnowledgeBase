  "OVERVIEW": "The Dromedary series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and till derived from sedimentary rocks.  Dromedary soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 15 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
