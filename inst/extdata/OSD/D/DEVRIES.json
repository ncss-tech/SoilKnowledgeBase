  "OVERVIEW": "The Devries series consists of moderately deep to hardpan, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  Devries soils are on basin rims of the San Joaquin Delta and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F.",

The soil between the depth of 8 inches to the duripan is not dry at any time unless artificially drained.  The texture control section from a depth of 10 inches to the duripan is 7 to 18 percent clay.  Content of gravel is 0 to 5 percent.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/1, 4/2, 4/1; 2.5Y 5/2, or 4/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/1, or 2.5Y 3/2.  Distinct or prominent mottles are present in lower A horizons.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 3 percent.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/3, 7/2, 4/2; 2.5Y 5/2 or 4/2 and moist color of 10YR 4/3, 4/2, 4/4, 5/2 or 2.5Y 4/2.  Mottles are distinct or prominent.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline and slightly or strongly effervescent.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bkqm horizon has a strongly cemented to indurated continuous laminar capping over weakly to strongly cemented material.  The cementation typically decreases with depth.  It has dry color of 10YR 7/2, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 5/4; 2.5Y 6/2, 6/4, 5/2; 5Y 6/2, 5/2, 5/3 or 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 4/2, 4/3; 2.5Y 5/2, 4/2; 5Y 4/2 or 4/3.
