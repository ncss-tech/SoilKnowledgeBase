The soil between the depth of 8 inches to the duripan is not dry at any time unless artificially drained.  The texture control section from a depth of 10 inches to the duripan is 7 to 18 percent clay.  Content of gravel is 0 to 5 percent.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/1, 4/2, 4/1; 2.5Y 5/2, or 4/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/1, or 2.5Y 3/2.  Distinct or prominent mottles are present in lower A horizons.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 3 percent.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/3, 7/2, 4/2; 2.5Y 5/2 or 4/2 and moist color of 10YR 4/3, 4/2, 4/4, 5/2 or 2.5Y 4/2.  Mottles are distinct or prominent.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline and slightly or strongly effervescent.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bkqm horizon has a strongly cemented to indurated continuous laminar capping over weakly to strongly cemented material.  The cementation typically decreases with depth.  It has dry color of 10YR 7/2, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 5/4; 2.5Y 6/2, 6/4, 5/2; 5Y 6/2, 5/2, 5/3 or 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 4/2, 4/3; 2.5Y 5/2, 4/2; 5Y 4/2 or 4/3.  Mottles are faint to prominent."
