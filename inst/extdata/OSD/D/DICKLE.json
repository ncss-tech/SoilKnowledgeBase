  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are moist in the winter and spring and dry in the summer and fall for 45 to 60 consecutive days.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 56 to 59 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is from 10 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments in the particle-size control section average 5 to 25 percent, are mainly cobbles and gravel, and are most prevalent in the surface.  Pedons that are 10 to 14 inches to bedrock have the higher percentages of rock fragments.  The particle-size control section contains 27 to 35 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 16 inches thick.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 moist, and chroma of 2 moist and dry.  The dry value is darker than 5.5 when mixed to 7 inches.  It contains 35 to 50 percent rock fragments.\nThe BA and Bw horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry and 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 0 to 20 percent rock fragments."

Duncom and Trump soils contain carbonates.  Ganis, Hazton, Lotex, Spliten, Splitro, Tuggle and Udelope soils have less than 18 percent clay throughout the particle-size control section.  Hanagita and Heisspitz soils are udic.  Jenkinson soils are moderately or strongly alkaline, have hue of 5Y to 10YR and the coarse fragments are channers.  Skisams soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 39 to 41 degrees F."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum overly fractured igneous bedrock.  The climate is semiarid and summers are dry.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 35 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 40 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
