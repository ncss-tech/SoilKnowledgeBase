    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Dearborn soils are on narrow flood plains, and alluvial fans. Slope gradient ranges from 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in alluvium primarily derived from Ordovician-age interbedded limestone and calcareous shale. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches), and mean annual temperature ranges from 10.5 to 13 degrees C (51 to 56 degrees F). Frost free period ranges from 150 to 190 days. Elevation ranges from 128 meters (420 feet) to 243 meters (800 feet)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Carmel, Eden, Pate, and Woolper soils on adjacent hills, and Huntington and Wirt soils in flood plains. The well drained, deep Carmel, the well drained, moderately deep Eden, and the well drained, deep or very deep Pate soils are on hill slopes. The well drained, very deep Woolper soils are on toeslopes and lower lying backslopes. The well drained Huntington and Wirt soils do not have significant amounts of rock fragments within 102 cm (40 inches) of the surface, and typically are on slightly higher lying flood-plain steps."

The potential for surface water runoff is negligible or very slow. These soils are subject to frequent or occasional, very brief periods of flooding."
