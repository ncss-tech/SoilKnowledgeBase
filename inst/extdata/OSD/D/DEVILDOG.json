    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Devildog soils are on inset fans, drainageways and fan skirts. These soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff with a component of volcanic ash that is most abundant near the soil surface. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Elevation ranges from 1,290 to 2,210 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost free period ranges from 110 to 150 days."

The soil does not qualify for the ashy over loamy skeletal contrasting particle-size class because the ashy material does not extend 10 cm or more into the particle-size control section.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
