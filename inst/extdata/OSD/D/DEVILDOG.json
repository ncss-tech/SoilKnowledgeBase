  "OVERVIEW": "The Devildog series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff with a component of volcanic ash that is most abundant near the soil surface. Devildog soils are on inset fans, drainageways, and fan skirts. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 225 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",

The soil does not qualify for the ashy over loamy skeletal contrasting particle-size class because the ashy material does not extend 10 cm or more into the particle-size control section.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
