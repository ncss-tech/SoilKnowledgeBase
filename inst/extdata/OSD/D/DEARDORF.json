  "OVERVIEW": "The Deardorf series consists of moderately deep, well-drained soils on ridges and shoulder slopes of mountains.  Deardorf soils are formed in volcanic ash overlying colluvium from andesitic basalt.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
