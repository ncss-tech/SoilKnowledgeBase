  "OVERVIEW": "The Derwell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  The Derwell soils are on outwash fans and fan terraces.  Permeability is moderate over very rapid.  Slopes are 1 to 6 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
