  "OVERVIEW": "The Diamondville series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum weathered from calcareous loamstone and sandstone.  Diamondville soils are on fan remnants, plateaus, hills and ridges of cold intermountain basins and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 15 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 66 degrees F.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent and are either gravel or channers.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam, averaging 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is clay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 4 to 14 percent.  This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline. In some pedons the Bk horizon has textures of fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam."
