    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 3 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 66 degrees F.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent and are either gravel or channers.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam, averaging 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is clay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 4 to 14 percent.  This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline. In some pedons the Bk horizon has textures of fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam."

Alcova, Almy, Bateson, Forelle, Maysprings, Simanni, and Taffom soils do not have a paralithic contact above 40 inches.  Bluerim soils do not have continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation. Satanka soils have more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in material weathered from soft, calcareous loamstone and sandstone.  Elevations are 4,600 to 7,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 15 inches of which about half occurs mainly in the spring.  The mean annual temperature is about 39 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 58 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 80 to 120 days."
