  "OVERVIEW": "The Dalmatian series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Dalmatian soils are on valley floors, flood plains and low terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
