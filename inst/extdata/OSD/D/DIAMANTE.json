  "OVERVIEW": "The Diamante series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in valley fill alluvial deposits. Diamante soils are on strongly dissected, very old alluvial beds and have slopes of 15 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
