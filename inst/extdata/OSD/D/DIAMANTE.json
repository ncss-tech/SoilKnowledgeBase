Depth to the top of the argillic horizon is greater than 24 inches and depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 60 inches or more. Rock fragments range from 45 to 90 percent in a major part of the solum and the C horizon, and they are mainly less than 10 inches in diameter. Reaction of the profile ranges from neutral to medium acid.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sandy loam or loam and has 15 to 60 percent gravel and 10 to 30 percent cobbles.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is very light sandy loam or loamy sand and has 40 to 70 percent gravel and 10 to 30 percent cobbles.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 8. It is sandy clay or cobbly clay and has 50 to 70 percent gravel and 10 to 30 percent cobbles. It has angular or subangular blocky structure.\nSome pedons have a C horizon that has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6. It usually is light clay or clay loam and has 10 to 20 percent stones and 30 percent cobbles."
