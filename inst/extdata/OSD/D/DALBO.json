  "REVDATE": "02/2011",
  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Dalbo series consists of very deep, moderately well and somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous clayey glacial lacustrine sediments on lake plains and moraines. Slopes range from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to free carbonates range from 20 to 42 inches. The series control section does not have rock fragments. The argillic horizon has 35 to 60 percent of clay. B/A clay ratios commonly exceed 1.4. The upper part of the argillic horizon has more than 40 percent clay. The argillic horizon averages less than 20 percent fine sand and very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. The E horizon has value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. The A and E horizons are silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. They are moderately acid to neutral. Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon ranging from 6 to 10 inches in thickness and that has a value of 5.5 or more when dry.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It has Fe depletions with chroma of 2 or less at least in some part of the upper 10 inches. It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. It has few to many, thin distinct or prominent thick clay films in some to all parts. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have Bk horizons with masses or concretions of calcium carbonates.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay but thin strata of silt loam are included. Some pedons have loamy glacial till below 50 inches. It is slightly or moderately alkaline."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils have plane or slightly convex slopes on glacial lake plains and moraines. These soils commonly are in small nearly level to sloping areas about 5 to 30 acres in size. Slope gradients range from 0 to 30 percent. These soils formed in calcareous clayey lacustrine sediments of Late Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 33 inches. Frost-free days range from 88 to 150. Elevation above sea level ranges from 670 to 1600 feet."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity, expressed in inches per hour, is .6 to 2.0 in the upper part, .06 to .6 in the middle part, and .2 to 2.0 in the lower part. Depth to seasonal high saturation is as high as 1.5 feet in during spring\nin normal years."

Common crops in the southern part are corn, legume hay, oats, and soybeans, and in the northern part area legume hay and oats are the common crops. The native vegetation is ash, aspen, basswood, elm, and oak. Some places had a few white pines."

Base saturation greater than 60 percent in all parts of argillic horizons. 2/10/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected.\nADDITIONAL DATA: See Minn. Ag. Exp. Stat.
