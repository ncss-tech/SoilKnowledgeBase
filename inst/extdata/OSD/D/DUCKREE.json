    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and the depth to secondary carbonates typically is about 15 inches but ranges from 7 to 18 inches. Rock fragments in the 10 to 40 inch depths typically are rounded gravel but range to cobble.  They range from 40 to 70 percent, and increase in amount with increasing depth.  Clay percentage in the 10 to 40 inch depth ranges from 11 to 18 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature is 37 to 44 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.  The soil is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 85 to 90 consecutive days during the summer months which is more than one-half and less than three-fourths of the time the soil temperature is more than 41 degrees F. at a depth of 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is a gravelly silt loam, gravelly loam, very gravelly loam or loam.  The A horizon ranges from 5 to 50 percent rock fragments with 5 to 50 percent as gravel and 0 to 10 percent as cobble.  It is slightly to strongly effervescent and moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and 3 to 6 moist.  It is a gravelly loam, loam, very gravelly loam or very gravelly sandy loam that contains 10 to 45 percent rock fragments with 10 to 45 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent as cobble.  The Bw horizon has weak fine granular to subangular blocky structure.  It is strongly effervescent and is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 to 8 dry and 4 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is a very gravelly loam or extremely gravelly sandy loam.  The Bk horizon ranges from 35 to 70 percent rock fragments with 30 to 80 percent as gravel, and 5 to 10 percent as cobble.  It is moderately to very strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 6 dry and 1 to 8 moist.  It is a very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly loam or extremely gravelly fine sandy loam.  The C horizon ranges from 50 to 75 percent rock fragments, with 45 to 60 percent as gravel, and 5 to 25 percent as cobble.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline and strongly effervescent."

Siri soils have lime-silica pendants on the undersides of rock fragments in Bkq horizons and averages 18 to 25 percent clay in the control section.  Zer soils have Bkq horizons with silica pendants present."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Duckree soils are on stream cut valley walls, alluvial fans, foothill slopes and floodplains that have a slightly concave-convex shape.  The slope gradient commonly is 15 to 40 percent, but range from 0 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived mainly from quartzite, chert, and sandstone.  The elevations range from 6,200 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 35 to 42 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches.  Freeze-free period is 55 to 75 days."

(A horizon)\nCalcic horizon - the zone of carbonate accumulation from 15 to 28 inches. (Bk horizon)\nXeric feature - soil moisture regime is Aridic bordering on Xeric.\nThis soils classification was changed from a Xerollic Calciorthids to Xeric Haplocalcids in 9/94.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Lakewood MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
