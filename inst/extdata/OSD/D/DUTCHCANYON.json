    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Clegg, the competing Fishaven (T), Frenchollow (T) and Yeates Hollow soils.  Clegg soils are pachic, have an argillic horizon, are not calcareous to the surface and lack carbonatic mineralogy.  Fishaven soils formed in similar materials to Dutchcanyon and are on similar positions on hills.  Frenchollow and Yeates Hollow soils have greater than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Frenchollow soils are generally on north and east-facing hillsides.  Clegg soils are on east and north-facing hillsides on a lower landscape position than Dutchcanyon.  Yeates Hollow soils are on hillsides, mountainsides and fan terraces, above and below Dutchcanyon."
