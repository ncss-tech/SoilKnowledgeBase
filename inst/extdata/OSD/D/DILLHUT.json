Dillwyn soils do not have a buried soil. The somewhat excessively well drained Langdon soils do not have a buried soil and have fewer thinner lamellae. Langdon soils are on steeper, more rolling dunes. Plev soils are wetter and poorly drained and occur in depressions. Solvay soils are somewhat poorly drained and are fine-loamy and occur in interdunes."
