  "REVDATE": "07/2020",
  "STATES": "KS",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Dillhut series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, soils that formed in sandy eolian deposits over a buried alluvial soil. Dillhut soils are on dunes on paleoterraces in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains, MLRA 79. Slope ranges from 0 to 7 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 740 millimeters (29 inches), and mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degrees F), at the type location.",
