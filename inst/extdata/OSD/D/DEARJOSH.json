  "OVERVIEW": "The Dearjosh series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and alluvium derived from sandstone.  Dearjosh soils are on cuestas and mesas.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
