    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Carsitas (CA), Lagunita (AZ), Myoma (CA), Pintobasin (CA), and Rositas (CA) series. Carsitas, Lagunita, and Pintobasin soils formed in alluvium. In addition, Carsitas soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments and are dry for most of the year in the moisture control section. Lagunita soils are stratified, and have an irregular decrease in organic carbon and Pintobasin soils do not allow fine sand textures. Rositas soils include disseminated calcium carbonate or small amounts of calcium carbonate masses. Myoma soils have hues of 2.5Y or yellower throughout and contain conch and clam shells throughout the control section, and are dry for most of the year in the moisture control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dalelake soils are on sand dunes, coppice dunes and sand sheets. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. These soils formed in eolian material from mixed sources. Elevations range from 210 to 750 meters (690 to 2,460 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bolero, Ironage, Pintobasin, Coxpin, Carrizo, Sheephole and Supplymine soils. Bolero, Ironage, and Supplymine soils are on adjacent mountains. Bolero soils have a sandy-skeletal particle-size control section and a lithic contact within 36 centimeters (14 inches). Ironage and Supplymine soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections and calcic horizons. Ironage soils have a lithic contact within 50 centimeters (20 inches). Pintobasin and Carrizo soils are formed in alluvium and are found in adjacent drainageways. Pintobasin soils also occur on some adjacent fan aprons. Pintobasin soils have coarser sand textures and allow more rock fragments throughout the control section. Carrizo soils have a sandy-skeletal particle-size control section. Coxpin soils are found on adjacent fan remnants and have a weakly to moderately cemented duripan. Sheephole soils are on similar landforms but have an alluvial layer which contains more than 35 percent rock fragments within the particle-size control section."
