    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 70 inches and the argillic horizon terminates below a depth of 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 4 to 10 feet.  Rock fragments of weathered limestone, quartz, chert, and shale range form 0 to 20 percent in the upper part of the solum and from 0 to 40 percent in the lower part of the solum and C horizon.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral to about the 50 inch depth and from strongly acid to slightly acid below 50 inches.  Illite and vermiculite are the dominant clay minerals.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam in the fine- earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 8, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Some pedons have subhorizons of 5YR in the lower part of the B horizon.  Texture is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction with about 20 to 42 percent clay and about 40 to 65 percent silt.  Some pedons have subhorizons of clay or silty clay.  The upper 20 inches of the B horizon has a weighted average of less than 35 percent clay.  Structure is coarse or medium prismatic parting to fine or medium angular or subangular blocky of weak or moderate grade.  Consistence is friable or firm, slightly sticky or sticky, and slightly plastic or plastic.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 through 8 and chroma of 4 through 8.  Texture ranges from loam to clay in the fine-earth fraction."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Alanthus, Athol, Burkittsville (T), Cateache, Culleoka, Door, Dumfries, Ebbing, Frondorf, Grayford, Hayter, Kell, Lamotte, Legore, Loudonville, Manassas, Mechanicburg, Middleburg, Morrison, Myersville, Oatlands, Pannorama, Sowego, Spriggs, Sudley, Westmoreland, Wheeling and Williamburg series are in the same family. Alanthus, Door, Ebbing, Hayter, Lamotte, Manassas, Middleburg, Morrison, Sudley and Williamburg soils have argillic horizons terminating below a depth of 40 inches or have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the argillic horizon.  Athol soils have solum thickness ranges from 40 to 75 inches and are formed in residuum mostly from Triassic conglomerate or breccias. Cateache, Culleoka, Frondorf, Kell, Loudonville and Oatlands have depth to lithic or paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Dumfries soils have coarse fragments of rounded quartz gravel ranges from 1 to 15 percent in the solum and from 0 to 10 percent in the C horizon. Grayford series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in 0 to 51 centimeters (0 to 22 inches) of loess, till of Illinoian age, and residuum from limestone. Lamotte and Manassas soils do not have rock fragments of chert and limestone. Legore soils formed in material weathered from diabase, diorite, and related rocks. Mechanicburg soils formed in Wisconsinan or Illinoian Age till 20 to 36 inches thick and material weathered from the underlying fractured, fine grained sandstone or siltstone on uplands. Myersville sols have depth to a paralithic contact 40 to 60 inches, and depth to a lithic contact more than 60 inches. Pannorama soils formed predominantly in residuum from red Triassic and Jurassic interbedded siltstones and fine-grained sandstones of the Culpeper Basin of the Piedmont Plateau, depth to soft bedrock is 40 to 60 inches and depth to hard bedrock is more than 5 feet. Sowego sols depth to paralithic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches, depth to lithic contact is greater than 60 inches. Spriggs soils have depth from 20 to 40 inches to soft bedrock and 40 to 60 inches or more to hard bedrock. Westmoreland series consists of deep and very deep well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from siltstone, sandstone, and limestone. Wheeling series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderate permeability. These soils formed in silty or loamy alluvial materials on river terraces.\nThe Bolton, Bookwood, Brecknock, Carpenter, Dormont, Neshaminy, Penn, Ryder and Washington soils are in closely related families. Bolton series consist of deep and well drained soils formed in material weathered from interbedded limestone and sandstone bedrock on mountain side slopes. The Bookwood series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils overlying interbedded limestone and shale. The Brecknock series consists of deep, well drained soils. They formed in residuum weathered from metamorphosed red shale and sandstone. The Carpenter series consists of deep, well drained, soils that formed in moderately permeable loamy colluvium over slowly permeable residuum of weathered shale or siltstone. The Dormont series consists of deep and very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in formed in colluvium and residuum of nonacid shale and siltstone and thin beds of limestone and sandstone.  The Neshaminy series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in materials weathered from diabase and other dark colored basic rocks. The Penn series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in materials weathered from noncalcareous reddish shale, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone normally of Triassic age. The Ryder series consists of moderately deep well drained soils. They formed in residuum weathered from thin bedded shaly limestone. The Washington series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in old glacial drift (pre-Wisconsin Age) or colluvium derived mainly from limestone and granitic gneiss. They occur on nearly level to steep glacial till plains in limestone valleys."
