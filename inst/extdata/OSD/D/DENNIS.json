    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dennis soils are on interfluves and hillslopes on plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent but is commonly between 1 and 5 percent. The soils formed in residuum weathered from shale of Pennsylvanian age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1168 mm (37 to 46 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 14 to 17 degrees C (57 to 63 degrees F). Thornthwaite Annual P-E Index is greater than 64."

Bates soils have a fine-loamy control section, have a thinner solum, and are on slightly higher side slopes. Collinsville soils lack an argillic horizon, have sandstone within 51 cm (20 inches) of the soil surface, and are on slightly higher ridge crests and side slopes. Okemah soils have a thicker mollic epipedon and are on adjacent, slightly concave areas. Parsons soils have an ochric epipedon, an abrupt change of texture, and are on adjacent, slightly concave areas."
