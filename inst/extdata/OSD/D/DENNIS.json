  "OVERVIEW": "The Dennis series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from shale of Pennsylvanian age. These soils are on interfluves and hillslopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
