  "OVERVIEW": "The Doghair series consists of deep or very deep, well drained soils that formed in pyroclastic colluvium over residuum. Doghair soils are on cinder cone remnants and have slopes of 3 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
