    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the mantle and depth to till ranges from 51 to 102 cm. Depth to free carbonates is greater than 203 cm.  Volume of rock fragments in the mantle ranges from 2 to 14 percent with 2 to 14 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 0 to 2 percent stones. Volume of rock fragments in the till ranges from 1 to 10 percent with 1 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 2 percent cobbles and 0 to 1 percent stones. Rock fragments are mostly of mixed lithology.  The mantle averages less than 12 percent clay and contains more than 70 percent sand. The till ranges from 20 to 35 percent clay and contains less than 45 percent sand.\nThe O horizon (duff layer) when present, is as much as 5 cm thick.  It has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Reaction is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Dry color has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam. Reaction is very strongly to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have an E horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has a hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loamy sand or sand. The upper part can be sandy loam. It typically has faint to distinct Fe concentrations and/or depletions in the lower part. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nAll pedons have a glossic horizon comprised of a 2E/B, 2B/E or both. The E part of has a hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sandy loam or loam. The Bt part has the same colors and textures as the 2Bt horizon. Reaction is strongly to moderately acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has a typical hue of 5YR but ranges from 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is clay loam or loam. It is firm. Reaction is strongly to moderately acid.\nThe 2BC horizon when present, has the same colors described in the 2Bt horizon. It is loam or clay loam. It is firm. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2C horizon when present, has a typical hue of 5YR but ranges from 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam or clay loam. It is firm. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Branstad, Culver, Daybrook, Flambeau, Flintsteel(T), Hiles, Loyal and Nashwauk soils.  Branstad soils allow for free carbonates above 152 cm and average between 45 and 65 percent sand throughout.  Culver soils do not have a mantle containing 70 percent sand or greater. Daybrook and Nashwauk soils have a densic contact at depths of 102 to 152 cm.  Flambeau soils have less than 45 percent sand throughout.  Flintsteel soils have a densic contact at depths of 64 to 102 cm.  Hiles soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 51 to 102 cm.  Loyal soils have a silty mantle 30 to 91 cm thick."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils have slopes with gradients of 3 to 18 percent.  They are on summits and backslopes of moraines. They formed in a mantle of outwash and the underlying loamy till of the St. Louis sublobe of the Des Moines lobe of the Late Wisconsin age glaciation.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 3 to 5 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 500 to 762 mm.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 145.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 300 to 400 meters above sea level."

The moderately well drained Culver and well drained Duluth soils are on similar positions but do not have a mantle of outwash. The somewhat poorly drained Dusler soils are on slightly concave to slightly convex positions. The poorly drained Ellsburg and Hellwig soils are on plane or concave positions.   Organic soils in depressions are also common associates."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is 42.34 to 705 micrometers per second in the sandy part of the upper mantle (6 to 100 inches per hour) and .42 to 1.41 micrometers per second (0.06 to 0.20 inches per hour) in the lower part. This soil frequently has a perched zone of saturation above the till in spring and fall of normal years."
