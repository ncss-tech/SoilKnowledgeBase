Volume of rock fragments in the mantle ranges from 2 to 14 percent with 2 to 14 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 0 to 2 percent stones. Volume of rock fragments in the till ranges from 1 to 10 percent with 1 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 2 percent cobbles and 0 to 1 percent stones. Rock fragments are mostly of mixed lithology.  The mantle averages less than 12 percent clay and contains more than 70 percent sand. The till ranges from 20 to 35 percent clay and contains less than 45 percent sand.\nThe O horizon (duff layer) when present, is as much as 5 cm thick.  It has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Reaction is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Dry color has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam. Reaction is very strongly to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have an E horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has a hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loamy sand or sand. The upper part can be sandy loam. It typically has faint to distinct Fe concentrations and/or depletions in the lower part. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nAll pedons have a glossic horizon comprised of a 2E/B, 2B/E or both. The E part of has a hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sandy loam or loam. The Bt part has the same colors and textures as the 2Bt horizon. Reaction is strongly to moderately acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has a typical hue of 5YR but ranges from 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is clay loam or loam. It is firm. Reaction is strongly to moderately acid.\nThe 2BC horizon when present, has the same colors described in the 2Bt horizon. It is loam or clay loam. It is firm. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2C horizon when present, has a typical hue of 5YR but ranges from 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam or clay loam.

Branstad soils allow for free carbonates above 152 cm and average between 45 and 65 percent sand throughout.  Culver soils do not have a mantle containing 70 percent sand or greater. Daybrook and Nashwauk soils have a densic contact at depths of 102 to 152 cm.  Flambeau soils have less than 45 percent sand throughout.  Flintsteel soils have a densic contact at depths of 64 to 102 cm.  Hiles soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 51 to 102 cm.  Loyal soils have a silty mantle 30 to 91 cm thick."

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 3 to 5 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 500 to 762 mm.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 145.
