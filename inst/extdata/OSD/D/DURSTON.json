  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Durston series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and re-worked loess.  These soils are on relict stream terraces, alluvial fans, eroded fan remnants and hillslopes. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
