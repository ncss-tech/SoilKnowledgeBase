  "OVERVIEW": "The Deerlick series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in mixed volcanic ash and alluvium overlying alluvium and glacial till.  Deerlick soils are found on slopes of 0 to 10 percent on floodplains, terraces, and alluvial fans of glaciated mountain landscapes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 2,200 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
