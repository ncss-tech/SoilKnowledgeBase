    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry in the control section during the summer for more than 45 to 60 days in most years. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F. The solum is 30 to 50 inches thick and is slightly to moderately acid.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. The particle-size control section has 18 to 25 percent clay.  It has greater than 85 percent phosphate retention, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 2 to 3 percent, and 9 to 12 percent 15-bar moisture based on an air-dried sample.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. It is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Chroma of 3 is in some part between depth of 7 and 20 inches. The Bw horizon has many fine to medium distinct to prominent mottles with value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 through 6 when moist. It has mottles with chroma of 2 or less between 20 and 40 inches.  It has field estimated clay of 20 to 25 percent and has 2 to 10 percent gravel 2 to 3 mm in diameter.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. It is loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam with 5 to 20 percent gravel 2 to 3 mm in diameter. On steeper slopes the amount of larger gravel and cobbles can range up to 35 percent."
