  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. LGR",
  "REVDATE": "04/2005",
  "STATES": "NE",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Dankworth series consist of very deep, excessively drained rapidly permeable soils formed in sandy alluvium on foot slopes and fan remnants. Slopes range from 3 to 6 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
