Mottles occur between 30 and 60 inches.\nIn some places, the soil contains 15 to 20 percent fine gravel.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or less. Organic matter content is most commonly 3 to 5 percent, but ranges from 2.5 to 12 percent. The surface layer is slightly calcareous in some places where the soil is associated with other calcareous soils or where they are irrigated with calcareous water.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Considerable stratification occurs in the C horizon. The C horizon is slightly calcareous in some places."

These soils formed in noncalcareous, medium textured alluvium, derived primarily from granite, gneiss, schist and quartzite rocks.  The climate is dry subhumid with an average annual precipitation ranging from 14 to 20 inches."
