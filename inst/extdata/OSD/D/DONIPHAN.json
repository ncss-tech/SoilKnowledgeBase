  "OVERVIEW": "The Doniphan series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in cherty sediments and residuum from clayey shales and cherty dolomite or cherty limestone on side slopes and narrow ridgetops.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 46 inches.",

Some pedons have stone size chert fragments on the surface. The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches it 55 to 59 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. The E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. They are the gravelly or very gravelly analogues of silt loam or loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt part of the B/E horizon and upper part of the 2Bt horizons have hue of 10R to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Color of the lower part of the 2Bt horizons are quite variable, and colors are mottled in most pedons.  They have hue of 2.5Y to 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8 except for few or common gray mottles that are neutral or have chroma of 1 or 2. The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon averages between 48 and 70 percent clay.  The 2Bt horizon ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid.  The Bt part of the B/E horizon is silty clay loam or gravelly silty clay loam.  The upper part of the 2Bt horizon is clay or gravelly clay.  The lower part is clay or the gravelly to extremely gravelly analogues of clay."

Macedonia soils are commonly on higher ridgetops.  Bardley and Gatewood soils have lithic contacts within 40 inches of the surface and occur above Doniphan in the landscape.  Coulstone and Clarksville soils are loamy-skeletal and are on steep side slopes and narrow ridgetops. Gasconade and Opequon soils have lithic contacts within 20 inches of the surface and are on slopes below the Doniphan soils. Poynor soils are loamy-skeletal over clayey and are on similar slopes as Doniphan. Gassville soils are on adjacent lower side slopes and have solums less than 40 inches thick.  Hobson, Lebanon, Viraton, and Widerness soils have fragipans and are on broad ridgetops."
