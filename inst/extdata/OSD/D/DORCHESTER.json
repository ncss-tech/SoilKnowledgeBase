  "OVERVIEW": "The Dorchester series consists of very deep, well drained and moderately well drained soils formed in recent, calcareous, stratified alluvium. These soils are on narrow flood plains of small streams that have limestone bluffs on the nearby slopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. The mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters.",
