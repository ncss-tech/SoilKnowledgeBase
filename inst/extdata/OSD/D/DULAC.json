    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 16 to 34 inches.  Depth to the 2Bt horizon ranges from 30 to 55 inches.  The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout except the surface layer where limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silt loam.  In severely eroded areas the texture is silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 6, or rarely the hue is 5YR, value of 4 and chroma of 4 or 6.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam averaging between 25 and 32 percent clay.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 8.  Some pedons have common to many mottles in shades of yellow, brown, red, and gray.  In some pedons, this horizon is mottled and lacks an evident matrix color.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Bt and 2C horizons range from shades of red to shades of gray mottled with other colors.  They are silty clay or clay."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Byram, Gigger, Loring and Providence series in the same family.  Closely related are the Bude, Dickson, Grenada, Olivier and Paden series.  Byram soils, in the lower part of the solum, contain less than 40 percent clay and are medium acid to neutral.  Gigger, Loring, Providence, Bude, Grenada, Paden, and Olivier soils have loamy textures below the fragipan.  In addition, Olivier soils have mottles of chroma 2 or less in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  Dickson soils are siliceous."
