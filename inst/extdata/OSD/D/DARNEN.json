  "OVERVIEW": "The Darnen series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy colluvial-alluvial sediments from glacial drift on glacial moraines. They have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C (43 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 559 millimeters (22 inches).",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 61 to 122 centimeters (24 to 48 inches) in thickness. Depth to free carbonates is 51 to 152 centimeters (20 to 60 inches). The control section has 18 to 30 percent clay and from 15 to about 35 percent fine sand and coarser. Pedons have fine strata from downslope soil movement. Pedons commonly do not have rock fragments, but some have as much as 5 percent of the volume, mostly below 76 centimeters (30 inches). In some pedons thin lenses, less than 15 centimeters (6 inches) thick, of sand or loamy sand are in the lower part of the control section. The soil moisture control section is dry for 20 to 35 consecutive days at some time during the 120 days following the summer solstice. Some pedons have strata of loam to loamy sand and their gravelly modifiers below a depth of 152 centimeters (60 inches).\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam, silt loam, sandy loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. The lower value and/or chroma are mostly in the upper part of the B horizon. It is loam or clay loam. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline. Redoximorphic features are in some pedons below depths of 91 centimeters (36 inches).\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon, BCk horizon, and/or a C horizon"
