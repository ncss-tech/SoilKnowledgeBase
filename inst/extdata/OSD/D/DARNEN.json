  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 61 to 122 centimeters (24 to 48 inches) in thickness. Depth to free carbonates is 51 to 152 centimeters (20 to 60 inches). The control section has 18 to 30 percent clay and from 15 to about 35 percent fine sand and coarser. Pedons have fine strata from downslope soil movement. Pedons commonly do not have rock fragments, but some have as much as 5 percent of the volume, mostly below 76 centimeters (30 inches). In some pedons thin lenses, less than 15 centimeters (6 inches) thick, of sand or loamy sand are in the lower part of the control section. The soil moisture control section is dry for 20 to 35 consecutive days at some time during the 120 days following the summer solstice. Some pedons have strata of loam to loamy sand and their gravelly modifiers below a depth of 152 centimeters (60 inches).\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam, silt loam, sandy loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. The lower value and/or chroma are mostly in the upper part of the B horizon. It is loam or clay loam. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline. Redoximorphic features are in some pedons below depths of 91 centimeters (36 inches).\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon, BCk horizon, and/or a C horizon"

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soil formed in loamy, colluvial-alluvial sediments derived from loamy glacial till or drift. The mean annual temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C (38 to 45 degrees F). The mean annual precipitation is 485 to 735 millimeters (19 to 29 inches). The frost-free days range from 90 to 150 days. Elevation above sea level is 204 to 427 meters (670 to 1400 feet)."

The Barnes, Langhei and Buse soils are upland soils formed in glacial till, and they are on slopes above the Darnen soils. In some places they are associated with moderately well drained Svea, poorly drained Flom and very poorly drained Quam soils."

Often the color of the upper sediment is lighter than the original surface due to deposition; udic moisture regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
