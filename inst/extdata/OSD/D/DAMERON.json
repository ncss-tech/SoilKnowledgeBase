  "OVERVIEW": "The Dameron series consists of very deep, well drained soils on flood plains of small streams. They formed in silty alluvium and the underlying gravelly alluvium. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 41 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon commonly ranges from 24 to 36 inches, but extends to 80 inches or more in some pedons. Depth to gravelly and very gravelly alluvium ranges from 15 to 40 inches. These soils average less than 20 percent sand in the upper 1/3 of the particle size control section. The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 55 to 59 degrees F..\nThe A and Bw horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam and reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.  The Bw horizon is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the upper part and the gravelly or very gravelly analogues of these textures in the lower part.  Reaction of the Bw horizon also ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is the gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogues of silty clay loam, loam or sandy clay loam, but can be the gravelly or very gravelly analogues of clay loam or clay below depths of 36 inches. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral. Rock fragments are dominantly chert."
