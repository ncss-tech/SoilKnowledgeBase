  "OVERVIEW": "The Diamond series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils.  They formed in materials derived from limestone. These nearly level to moderately steep soils are on small irregular areas among limestone rockland in coastal plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F.",

Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline. Texture is clay loam or loam throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 and chroma of 4 to 6.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has similar color and texture as the Bw horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 and chroma of 4 to 6.\nThe Cr layer, where present is less than 5 inches thick.  It is soft limestone which rock structure that is root limiting.\nThe R layer is semiconsolidated silicified limestone."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Diamond soils occur in small irregular areas in association with limestone rockland and occupy 50 to 70 percent of the landscape.  These soils are on nearly level to undulating coastal plains with slope gradients of 0 to 12 percent.  The climate is semiarid.  Rainfall ranges from 30 to 35 inches and temperature from 78 to 80 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include Aguilita, Fredensborg, Hesselburg and Sion soils.  The Aguilita soils are very shallow gravelly calcareous soils occurring on steeper slopes, and are underlain by soft limestone.  The Fredensborg are dark brown to black calcareous fine textured soils underlain by marl or soft limestone.  The Hesselberg soils occupy low lying swales or valleys. The Sion are shallow grayish brown calcareous moderately fine textured soils underlain by marl or soft limestone."
