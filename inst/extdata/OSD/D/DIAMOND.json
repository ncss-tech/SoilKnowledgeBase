These soils are on nearly level to undulating coastal plains with slope gradients of 0 to 12 percent.  The climate is semiarid.  Rainfall ranges from 30 to 35 inches and temperature from 78 to 80 degrees F."

The Aguilita soils are very shallow gravelly calcareous soils occurring on steeper slopes, and are underlain by soft limestone.  The Fredensborg are dark brown to black calcareous fine textured soils underlain by marl or soft limestone.  The Hesselberg soils occupy low lying swales or valleys. The Sion are shallow grayish brown calcareous moderately fine textured soils underlain by marl or soft limestone."
