  "OVERVIEW": "The Deception series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a thin mantle of ash influenced loess overlying friable to firm gravelly glacial till. Deception soils are on glacial till plains, and hills.  Slopes range from 0 to 85 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches.",

The particle size control section is loamy-skeletal and averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments. Occasional stones are present throughout.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum and moderately acid or neutral in the substratum. Mean annual soil temperature is 33 to 37 degrees F.\nThe E horizon has hue of 1OYR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Total content of coarse fragments is 0 to 15 percent, 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.
