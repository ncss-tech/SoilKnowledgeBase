    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the silty loess mantle ranges from 4 to 10 inches. Depth to gravelly glacial till ranges from 4 to 11 inches.  The particle size control section is loamy-skeletal and averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments. Occasional stones are present throughout.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum and moderately acid or neutral in the substratum. Mean annual soil temperature is 33 to 37 degrees F.\nThe E horizon has hue of 1OYR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Total content of coarse fragments is 0 to 15 percent, 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. Total content of coarse fragments is 0 to 15 percent, O to 5 percent cobble and O to 1O percent gravel.\nThe 2Bs horizon (where present) has hue of 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is fine very gravelly sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam. Total content of coarse fragments is 15 to 60 percent, 0 to 3 percent stones, 0 to 20 percent cobble, and 10 to 60 percent gravel.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 1OYR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam. Coarse fragment content ranges from 5 to 20 percent cobble and 5 to 40 percent gravel. This horizon is absent in many pedons.\nThe 2C horizons have hue from 1OYR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is sandy loam or loam modified by 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Deception soils are on glacial till plains, and hills. Slopes range from O to 85 percent. The soils formed in a loess mantle consisting of an admixture of amorphous material of volcanic origin and airborne sediments from broad nonvegetated flood plains. The loess mantle is underlain by friable or firm gravelly glacial till material. The climate is transitional maritime - continental. Mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 22 inches."
