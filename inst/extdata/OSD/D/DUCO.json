    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Argabak, Bellehelen, Brier, Horseflat, Nuhelen, Ocud, Orhood, Reywat, and Upatad series.\nArgabak soils have mollic epipedons that are 13 to 18 cm thick.  Bellehelen, Brier and Nuhelen soils are intermittently moist in some part for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October. Horseflat soils do not have fractured bedrock with illuvial clay, have secondary silica coats over 30 percent of the surface area of the bedrock, have transitional AB horizons, and have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Ocud soils average 15 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Orhood soils average 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are dominated by cobbles.  Reywat soils have identifiable secondary carbonates in the lower part of the Bt2 horizon, on the surface of the lithic contact, or in cracks within the bedrock.  Upatad soils have 5 to 15 percent durinodes and identifiable secondary carbonates in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Duco soils are on structural benches, hills, and mountains. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from volcanic rocks such as rhyolite and andesite, but also from welded tuff, basalt, metasedimentary, and some metavolcanic rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 1,220 to 2,445 meters in Nevada and California and as low as 807 meters in Idaho.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is 6 to 11 degrees C.  The frost-free period is typically 70 to 115 days, but ranges to 155 days in Idaho."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Duco soils are used for forest land, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly a forest canopy of singleleaf pinyon and Utah juniper with an understory of Wyoming big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, Currant ssp., Thurber's needlegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg's bluegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.  Duco soils in Idaho do not have a forested plant community. This pedon is correlated to F026XY044NV, PIMO-ARTRV woodland."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 48 cm (A1, A2, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 13 to 48 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 48 cm to underlying hard bedrock (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 13 to 48 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nClassification was updated to 11th edition on 07/2011 and changed from Lithic Argixerolls to Aridic Lithic Argixerolls.\nThis series is mapped in pinyon-juniper woodland in Nevada and California and in rangeland in Idaho.  There is a need to split the series to better account for these wide differences in plant community and soil climate.  The series concept needs to be evaluated and clarified as a part of the MLRA update process.\nADDITIONAL DATA: User pedon ID: 2006NV005004.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
