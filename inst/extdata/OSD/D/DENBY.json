  "OVERVIEW": "The Denby series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sodium rich clayey and silty sediments on terraces, uplands, and fans.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The SAR of the A horizon ranges from 4 to 8 and is more than 10 within a depth of 10 inches of the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay or silty clay loam.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR; value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 7 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay, silty clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  It ranges from slightly to moderately alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR; value of 6 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay, silty clay, or clay loam.  It ranges from slightly to strongly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 6 to 8 and 5 to 7 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is silty clay loam or silt loam stratified with layers of very fine sandy loam to clay and contains less than 35 percent clay.  Bedding planes are evident in most pedons.  The 2C horizon ranges from slightly or strongly alkaline.  Common fine nests of salts are in some pedons.  Mudstone or siltstone is below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons."
