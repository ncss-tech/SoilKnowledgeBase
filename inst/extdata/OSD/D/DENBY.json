    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Carbonates are at or near the surface.  The SAR of the A horizon ranges from 4 to 8 and is more than 10 within a depth of 10 inches of the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay or silty clay loam.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR; value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 7 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay, silty clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  It ranges from slightly to moderately alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR; value of 6 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay, silty clay, or clay loam.  It ranges from slightly to strongly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 6 to 8 and 5 to 7 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is silty clay loam or silt loam stratified with layers of very fine sandy loam to clay and contains less than 35 percent clay.  Bedding planes are evident in most pedons.  The 2C horizon ranges from slightly or strongly alkaline.  Common fine nests of salts are in some pedons.  Mudstone or siltstone is below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons."

Heldt soils have a lower SAR than 10 in the control section and have greater than 35 percent clay in the C horizon.  Littlenan soils have weathered shale paralithic contact within depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Lockerby soils do not have a cambic horizon and have shale bedrock within depths of 21 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Denby soils are on level to nearly level terraces, uplands, and alluvial fans.  Slopes are plane or slightly concave and range from 0 to 4 percent.  Denby soils formed in clayey over silty sediments weathered from sodium rich sedimentary rocks.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 53 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches.  Growing season is about 120 to 150 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 11 to 14 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 3200."

Cedarpass soils are on similar landscapes as the Denby soils.  Interior soils are in drainageways and on flood plains.  Norrest and Whitewater soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  They are slightly higher on the landscape."
