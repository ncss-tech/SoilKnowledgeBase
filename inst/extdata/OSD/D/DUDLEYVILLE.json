  "OVERVIEW": "The Dudleyville series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed from mixed fan alluvium and stream alluvium. Dudleyville soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces and have slopes of 1 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 67 degrees F.",
