  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 20 to 40 inches.  A few sandstone and siliceous cobbles are on the surface of some pedons.\nThe A1 horizon is dark brown (10YR 4/3; 7.5YR 4/2), brown (10YR 5/3; 7.5YR 5/4), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), or dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4).  The E horizon is generally 1 to 2 units of value and chroma higher than the A horizon.  The A and E horizons are gravelly or very gravelly sandy loam or loamy sand and their nongravelly counterparts.  Siliceous pebbles and sandstone fragments, mainly less than 3 inches in diameter, comprise up to 70 percent by volume.  Thickness is 4 to 12 inches.  These horizons are slightly acid or medium acid.\nThe B horizon is red (2.5YR 4/6, 4/8, 5/6, 5/8), yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 4/8, 5/6, 5/8), reddish brown (5YR 4/4, 5/4), or light reddish brown (5YR 6/4).  Moist values are 4 or more in some part of each pedon.  Mottles in shades of gray, brown, or yellow are in the lower Bt horizon of some pedons.  Mottles with chromas of 2 or less, where present, are at depths of 30 to 40 inches.  Reaction is medium acid, strongly acid, or very strongly acid.  The Bt1 and Bt2 horizons are clay or sandy clay with clay content of 35 to 55 percent.  Siliceous and sandstone pebbles comprise 0 to 15 percent by volume.  The Bt3 horizon is sandy clay or sandy clay loam.\nThe Cr horizon is reddish, brownish, or yellowish acid, massive siltstone or soft mudstone."

The soil formed in residuum from massive siltstone or soft mudstone.  Gravel on the surface and in the A horizon is presumed to be lag gravel from the Uvalde formation.  The climate is moist subhumid with a mean annual precipitation of 28 to 38 inches.  The P-E indices are 44 to 66.  Average annual temperature is about 67 degrees F."

Crockett soils occur at lower elevations.  Vernia soils occur at the crests of ridges at slightly higher elevations."
