  "REVDATE": "03/2009",
  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Durbin series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils in tidal areas along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of Peninsular Florida.  They formed in well decomposed herbaceous organic material over sandy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Sulfur content ranges from 0.75 to 3.25 percent in the Oa horizons.  The organic material in all the tiers is dominantly sapric.  Conductivity of the saturation extract of the Oa horizons range from 45 to 300 mmho/cm.  Reaction of the Oa horizons range from extremely acid to neutral in 0.01M CaC12 in its natural state and from extremely acid to moderately acid after drying.  Reaction of the C horizon ranges from extremely acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  Content of mineral material ranges from about 35 to 60 percent.  Texture is muck.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 6.  Some pedons have 5 to 20 percent, by volume, sand-size fragments of shell.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand."

They formed in thick deposits of herbaceous plant remains over sandy marine deposits.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 71 to 73 degrees F."
