Agassiz soils have particle-size control sections that have 18 to 35 percent clay.  Alomax and Hogsby soils lack Bw horizons.  Anatone soils have average annual soil temperature of 44 to 47 degrees F. have a component of loess and volcanic ash. Bluecanyon soils have less than 10 percent cobbles throughout. Bocker and Nayrib soils have a lithic contact at 10 inches or less.  Cedaran soils have mollic epipedons 7 to 10 inches thick and have average annual soil temperatures of 44 to 47 degrees F.  Falula, Gando, Grink and Swanner soils have layers of calcium carbonate accumulation.   Foxol soils are slightly acid to medium acid and do not have mollic colors immediately above the lithic contact.  Gomine and Onaqui soils have 18 to 27 percent clay. Kenypeak soils have less than 60 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section. Little Pole soils have average annual soil temperature of about 45 degrees F. and have clay films present in the A3 and B horizons.  Rexmont soils are moderately or strongly alkaline, somewhat excessively drained, and have disseminated carbonates above the lithic contact.  Van Wagoner soils lack Bw horizons and have average annual soil temperature greater than 43 degrees F."

Suryon soils are very deep and are pachic.  Vipont soils have an argillic horizon and are moderately deep to bedrock.  Prucree soils are on similar landscapes as Dipcreek, but are on slightly lower, smooth to concave slopes.  Suryon soils are on foot slopes, terraces, and hillsides generally below Dipcreek soils.  Vipont soils are on similar landscapes to Dipcreek and are generally south-facing."
