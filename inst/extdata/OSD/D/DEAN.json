In some pedons the weak cementation is discontinuous.  Below a depth of about 36 to 52 inches, secondary carbonates decrease markedly with depth.  In some pedons, the 2C horizon does not occur.\nPercent gypsum in the mineralogy control section is estimated to range from 0 to 5 percent.\nRock fragments are dominantly limestone or indurated carbonate gravel.  In some pedons the rock fragments are mixed and may be granite, quartzite, sandstone or siltstone.  In the 10 to 40 inch control section the weighted average of rock fragments is typically 15 to 35 percent.  In some pedons, i.e. Utah, the weighted average is between 10 to 15 percent.\nProfile reaction:  slightly to strongly alkaline and calcareous throughout.\nPercent clay in control section:  18 to 35\nPercent fine sand or coarser:  more than 15\nIn some pedons limestone bedrock may occur between 42 and 60 inches.\nA horizon\nHue:  7.5YR or 10YR\nValue:  3 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist\nChroma:  2 to 5\nTexture (fine earth fraction):  fine sandy loam or loam\nBw horizon (where present)\nHue:  7.5YR or 10YR\nValue:  5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist\nChroma: 2 to 4\nTexture (fine earth fraction):  fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam\nBk horizons\nHue:  5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue:  5 to 8 dry, 4 to 8 moist\nChroma:  2 to 6\nTexture (fine earth fraction):  loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam\n2C horizon (where present)\nHue:  7.5YR or 10YR\nValue:  6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist\nChroma:  2 to 6\nTexture (fine earth fraction):  loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam"

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Dean soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from limestone, but also may contain material derived from granite, quartzite, gypsum rock, sandstone or eolian sand deposits.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent but range to 40 percent in Utah.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches, but ranges to 16 inches in some areas.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 58 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is typically 130 to 180 days, but ranges to 110 days in Utah.  Elevation ranges from 4,500 to 7,200 feet."
