  "OVERVIEW": "The Dean series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from limestone.  Permeability is moderately slow or moderate.  Dean soils are on bajadas, ridges, mesas and fan terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

In some pedons the rock fragments are mixed and may be granite, quartzite, sandstone or siltstone.
