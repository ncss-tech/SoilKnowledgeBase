  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 42 to 70 inches. Depth to carbonates, where present, is greater than about 5 feet. The particle-size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay. Sand content is less than 7 percent in all parts.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 (5 dry) and chroma of 2 or 3. In undisturbed areas the A horizon has value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry) and chroma of 1 or 2. Clay content is 18 to 27 percent. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral, depending on the liming history.\nThe E horizon, where present, has value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3. When the soil is dry, common gray to white clay depletions are easily discernible on faces of peds in the E and B horizons, but these features are not readily apparent when the soil is moist. Clay content is 18 to 27 percent. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have an EB or a BE horizon.\nThe Bt and BC horizons have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6 (2 to 6 in the lower part). Redoximorphic iron depletions are in the lower part, above 40 inches. Texture typically is silty clay loam, but the lower part includes silt loam. Clay content is 27 to 35 percent in the upper part and is 24 to 32 percent in the lower part. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe CB or C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 5 or 6; and chroma of 1 to 4. Clay content is 18 to 27 percent. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline."

They are on less sloping summits nearby. The well drained Wakenda soils have a mollic epipedon. The moderately well drained Winfield soils are on similar landform positions closer to the drainageways."

Argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 13 to 57 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons). Redoximorphic iron depletions - the zone from 26 to 80 inches (Bt2, Bt3, BCt, and CB horizons).
