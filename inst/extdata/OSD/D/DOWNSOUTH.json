When the soil is dry, common gray to white clay depletions are easily discernible on faces of peds in the E and B horizons, but these features are not readily apparent when the soil is moist. Clay content is 18 to 27 percent. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have an EB or a BE horizon.\nThe Bt and BC horizons have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6 (2 to 6 in the lower part). Redoximorphic iron depletions are in the lower part, above 40 inches. Texture typically is silty clay loam, but the lower part includes silt loam. Clay content is 27 to 35 percent in the upper part and is 24 to 32 percent in the lower part. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe CB or C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 5 or 6; and chroma of 1 to 4. Clay content is 18 to 27 percent.
