  "OVERVIEW": "The Deercut series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils formed in mixed volcanic ash and loess over a indurated duripan. Deercut soils are on side slopes and interfluves on nonglaciated plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

These soils are usually dry in the moisture control section for more than half the cumulative time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 17 inches thick. The argillic horizon contains 11 to 18 percent clay and 15 percent or more fine sand or coarser. The upper 10 to 17 inches of the profile has an estimated 30 to 60 percent volcanic glass, including 5 to 30 percent sand-size pumice in the 0.02 to 2mm size fraction, a moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.35 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.30 percent and field estimated clay of 4 to 10 percent. Depth to indurated lime-silica duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches and depth to basalt is 30 to 60 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry. Chroma is 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist. Reacton is neutral or slightly alkaline. Textures are ashy fine sandy loam or ashy sandy loam.\nThe 2Bt1 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist. Chroma is 3 or 4 dry. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bt2 horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist. Chroma is 3 or 4 dry. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline."
