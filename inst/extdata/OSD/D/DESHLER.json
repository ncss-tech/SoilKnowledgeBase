The soils formed in residuum from siltstone or semiconsolidated sediments that may contain volcanic tuff.  In some areas, the soils occupy mounds. The average annual precipitation is about 13 to 16 inches.  The average annual air temperature is about 45 to 50 degrees F, and the frost-free season is about 90 to 145 days."
