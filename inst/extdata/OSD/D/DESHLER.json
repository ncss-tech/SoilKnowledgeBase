  "OVERVIEW": "The Deshler series consists of moderately deep, well-drained soils that formed in residuum from siltstone or volcanic tuffaceous material.  Deshler soils are on rolling hills and have slopes of 0 to 60 percent.  Permeability is slow.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
