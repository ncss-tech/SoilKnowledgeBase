  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the loamy stratified mantle and the depth  to the sandy alluvium ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  The sandy alluvium averages more than 90 percent sand.  Coarse fragments are generally lacking in the upper loamy alluvium.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 35 percent and volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the lower sandy alluvium.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam.  Reaction naturally ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has colors similar to the Ap horizon. It is stratified layers of fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. Reaction naturally ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is stratified layers of fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  Reaction naturally ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizons have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is stratified layers of loamy fine sand, fine sand, sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly analogs of sand or coarse sand and averages 90 percent or more sand in the fine earth fraction.  Reaction naturally ranges from moderately acid to neutral."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ankeny, Disco, Eyota, Hanlon, Lomax, and Shellwood series.  None of these soils except Hanlon and Shellwood have redox features or saturation in the series control section.  Hanlon soils do not have average texture of sand or loamy sand in the lower part of the series control section.  Shellwood soils have free carbonates throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dunnbot soils are on flood plains.  In some areas, this soil is on natural levees near river channels and old oxbows and in other areas it is on nearly level to slightly concave rises on floodplains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in loamy and sandy alluvium of mixed mineralogical composition.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 650 to 750 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Near the type location these include the Algansee, Kalmarville, and Scotah series.  The somewhat poorly drained Algansee and the poorly drained Kalmarville soils are in lower frequently flooded positions on the floodplain.  The moderately well drained Scota soils are on positions similar to those of Dunnbot soils where the soil formed entirely in sandy alluvium."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Surface runoff is moderately slow or slow.  Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy alluvium and rapid or very rapid in the sandy alluvium.  Dunnbot soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of 3.5 to 6.0 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period from October to June in 6 or more out of 10 years.  Dunnbot soils are subject to occasional, brief flooding at some time during the period of March to June."
