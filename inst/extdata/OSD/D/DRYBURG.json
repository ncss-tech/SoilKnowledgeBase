  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from about 24 to 40 inches in thickness and corresponds to the depth to the IIC horizon.  The solum ranges from medium acid to neutral.  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 44 to 47 degrees F.  Forested areas have a black (10YR 2/1) A1 horizon, 1 to 3 inches thick.\nThe Ap horizon is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) or very dark gray (10YR 3/1).  The A2 is grayish brown (10YR 5/2) or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2).  The A horizons are sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe B2ir horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2, 3, or 4.  A B22ir or B3 horizon, slightly lighter in color than the B2ir, is in some pedons.  The B horizon is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe A'2 part of the B&A horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand.  The B't part has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 and chroma of 4.  The B't part comprises 60 to 80 percent of the B&A horizon.  It is loam, sandy loam, or light sandy clay loam.  Thin discontinuous clay flows are in pores and on some peds.  High chroma mottling are in the B&A horizon in some pedons.\nThe IIC horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silty clay or clay.  White (5YR 8/1) or pinkish white (5YR 8/2) coatings, varves or small concretions of secondary carbonates are in some pedons.  The IIC horizon is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cabinet, Humbird and Superior series in the same family and the Manistee and Ontonagon series. The Cabinet soils have a different climate.  Humbird soils have the lower sola formed in residuum weathered from sandstone and shale.  Superior soils have thinner loamy deposits over clayey sediments.  Manistee soils have sandier upper sequum A horizons. Ontonagon soils lack loamy upper sequum and spodic horizons."

Climate is continental, with a mean annual precipitation of 26 to 33 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 41 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual summer temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F."
