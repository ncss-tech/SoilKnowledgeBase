  "OVERVIEW": "The Drews series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in old gravelly alluvium derived from basalt, tuff, and rhyolite.  Drews soils are on lake terraces and fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Soils are usually moist and are dry in all parts between depths of 4 to 12 inches about 90 to 115 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The soils are moist in the winter.  The solum is 30 to 60 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  Siltstone and duripans occur at depths of 40 to 60 inches in some pedons.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 35 percent coarse fragments, dominantly gravel size.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt and BC horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or sandy clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 35 percent gravel.  It has weak prismatic, subangular, or angular blocky structure.  It is slightly acid or neutral."

Coolbrith soils are somewhat poorly drained and have mottles in the lower B horizons. Dotta soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the Bt horizons and have sandy clay loam to coarse sand C horizons.  Gorman soils have 20 to 28 percent clay in the Bt horizon, have 15 to 25 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the A and B horizons and have a mean annual temperature of about 57 degrees F.  Harriman soils are usually dry.  Haysum soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 52 to 59 degrees F. and are dry for 85 to 95 consecutive days.  Robinette soils have a silt loam loess mantle, and the top of the argillic horizon is below 40 inches.  Supan soils have mean annual soil temperature warmer than 55 degrees F.  Van Dusen soils have considerable mica and coarse and very coarse sand grains of quartz.  Waha soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.   Wapinitia soils have silty clay loam Bt horizons having hard noncalcareous nodules and formed in loess and ash.  Yaxon soils are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days."
