Gravel of mixed lithology range from 0 to 10 percent by volume in the loamy mantle and 0 to 15 percent in the sandy substratum. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is coarse sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. It is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nAB horizon is present in some pedons. Colors and textures are similar to those of the A and Bw horizons.\nThe Bw horizon has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is coarse sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sand, coarse sand, or sand. It is moderately acid to neutral.\n2BC horizon is present in some pedons. Colors and textures are similar to those of the 2Bw and 2C horizons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is coarse sand, sand, or fine sand or strata of these textures.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Buckney, Burkhardt, Estherville, and Mishawaka soils. The Buckney soils have free carbonates above a depth of 24 inches. Burkhardt soils average over 15 percent rock fragments in the lower half of the series control section. Estherville soils have free carbonates above a depth of 30 inches. Mishawaka soils are moderately acid or strongly acid in the C horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils have plane or convex slopes with gradient of 0 to 18 percent on outwash plains, deltas, stream terraces and valley trains. They formed in a coarse-loamy mantle and underlying sandy substratum. The sediments are glaciofluvial or eolian in origin. Mean air annual temperature is about 45 to 50 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 24 to 32 inches.  Frost free days range from 110 to 172. Elevations above sea level range from 700 to 1600 feet."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 12 inches (Ap and A horizons); Cambic horizon - the zone from 12 inches to 19 inches (Bw horizon).\nA moderately wet phase presently exists that would likely be correlated to an oxyaquic subgroup.\nThe Dickman series established in Hennepin County has an argillic horizon. It did not fit the concept of Dickman; however, so the official type location of Dickman series was moved to a better location to fit the concept in MLRA-103. 1/19/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to MAES Central File Code No. 760 for results of some laboratory analysis of similar pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
