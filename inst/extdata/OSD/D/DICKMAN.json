  "REVDATE": "01/2011",
  "STATES": "IA,MN,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Dickman series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in glacial outwash or eolian materials consisting of a loamy mantle and underlying sandy sediments. These soils are on outwash plains, valley trains, stream terraces and deltas. Slopes range from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 12 inches (Ap and A horizons); Cambic horizon - the zone from 12 inches to 19 inches (Bw horizon).\nA moderately wet phase presently exists that would likely be correlated to an oxyaquic subgroup.\nThe Dickman series established in Hennepin County has an argillic horizon. It did not fit the concept of Dickman; however, so the official type location of Dickman series was moved to a better location to fit the concept in MLRA-103. 1/19/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected."
