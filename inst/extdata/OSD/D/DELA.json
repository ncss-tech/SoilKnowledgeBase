  "OVERVIEW": "The Dela series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in loamy and sandy alluvium. These soils are on Coastal Plain, Ouachita Mountains, and Arkansas Valley and Ridges local stream flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1219 mm (48 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.2 degrees C (63 degrees F.)",
