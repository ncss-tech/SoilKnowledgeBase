  "REVDATE": "8/98",
  "STATES": "VI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Dorothea series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on summits and sideslopes of volcanic hills and mountains.  They formed in material weathered from igneous bedrock.  Near the type location, the mean annual air temperature is about 80 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is bout 40 inches.  Slopes range from 20 to 90 percent.",
