    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of solum ranges from 50 to 80 inches.  The base saturation is greater than 50 percent in the upper part of the solum and decreases with depth.  Typically, fragments of ironstone are scattered throughout the solum and at least one subhorizon of the argillic horizon contains many fragments that make up from 15 to 60 percent of the volume.  Fragments of ironstone make up from 5 to 35 percent of the volume of the particle-size control section.  The volume of coarse fragments decreases with depth in most pedons.  The caly content of the series control section averages 18 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or their gravelly counterparts.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly or very gravelly counterparts.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have an E horizon.  Where present, it has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly counterparts.  Reaction of the E horizon ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.  The combined thckness of the A and E or A and BE horizons ranges from 7 to 20 inches where the texture is loamy fine sand and from 7 to 24 inches where the texture is fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles in shades of yellow, red, and brown range from none to common.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or their gravelly or very gravelly counterparts.  Individual subhorizons contain fragments of ironstone that can make up as little as 1 percent of the volume or as much as 60 percent.  One or more discontinuous to nearly continuous layers of fractured ironstone are in the Bt horizon of some pedons.  Where present, the layers range in thickness from 1/4 to 8 inches.  The lateral distance between fractures in the layers ranges from 2 to 10 inches and averages 2 to 4 inches.  Pockets and streaks of grayish or whitish clay and yellowish loamy or sandy material range from none to common.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe B/C1 horizon consists of reddish loamy material (Bt) and yellowish loamy or sandy material (C).  The Bt part has colors similar to those of the Bt horizon, except that hue of 10R is included.  Its texture is fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  The consistence of the Bt part ranges from friable to firm and it is slightly brittle in some pedons.  The C part has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It makes up 20 to 40 percent of the horizon.  Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Consistence of the C part typically is slightly hard or hard and slightly brittle or brittle, and it is friable to loose in some pedons.  Small to large pockets or layers of weakly cemented sandstone make up the C part in some pedons.  Small pockets, streaks, and strata of grayish or whitish clay range from few to common.  Fragments of ironstone make up from less than 1 percent to as much as 5 percent of the horizon.  The reaction of the B/C horizon ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe B/C2 horizon is similar to the B/C1 horizon, except that the C part of the B/C2 horizon has more weakly cemented sandston that makes up from 30 to 50 percent of the volume.  The C part is hard and brittle, but it can be easily cut with a spade.  The C part is in small to large pockets and strata.  Few to common fine and medium roots are concentrated in the Bt material.  The Bt part is mainly narrow to wide, vertically oriented clay flows.  Thin or thick clay films are on some ped faces of the Bt material  Small to large pockets and streaks of grayish or whitish clay or shaly clay range from few to common.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon.  Where present, it has hue of 7.5YR to 10R value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Mottles in shades of yellow or brown range from none to common.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam.  Reaction ranges form very strongly acid to medium acid.  COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Attoyao, Caledonia, Elrose, Petal, and Sallisaw series in the same family and the Cuthbert, Kirvin, Ruston, and Vaucluse series.  None of the competing soils formed in materials high in content of siderite.  The Attoyao, Caledonia, Petal, Ruston, and Sallisaw soils do not contain fragments or layers of ironstone in the solum.  In addition, the Petal soils have a clayey lower Bt horizon and the Sallisaw soils have a gravelly lower 2B horizon.  The Elrose and Vaucluse soils contain fragments of ironstone that make up less than 15 percent by volume of the argillic horizon.  In addition, the Elrose soils contain fragments of glaucontie within the solum.  The Cutherbert and Kirvin soils are clayey and have a base saturation of less than 35 percent at a depth of 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon."

The typical pedon is forming in sediments of the Cockfield or Cook Mountain Formation, Claiborne Group, Eocene series.
