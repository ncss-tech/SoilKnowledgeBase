  "STATES": "OK,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Devol series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in loamy and sandy eolian sediments of Pleistocene age. These soils are on nearly level to moderately steep dunes and wind reworked sandsheets on terraces of the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C). Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
