  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 16 to 42 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Rock fragments, mainly gravel, channers and cobblestones, range from 10 to 35 percent by volume in the A horizon, 15 to 60 percent in the B horizon and 35 to 70  percent in the C.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. Dry color value is 6 or more. Texture is loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is weak, moderate or strong granular or weak  subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid, unless limed.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, chroma of 3 or 4, and is mottled. Texture ranges from sandy loam to silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid, unless influenced by lime.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 1 through 4. Texture ranges from loamy sand to loam in the fine earth fraction. Consistence is loose or very friable. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family. The Castile, Craigsville, Farnham, Trestle and Weider series are similar soils in related families. The Castile and Farnham soils have a loamy-skeletal particle size class, but both soils have a regular decrease in organic carbon in the profile and are not subject to flooding. The  Craigsville soils are better drained soils that do not have mottling in the B horizon. The Trestle soils lack low chroma mottles within 24 inches of the soil surface. The Weider soils have a coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal particle size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Deposit soils are on low terraces along streams or on nearly level parts of alluvial fans. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. These soils formed in gravelly alluvium overlying glaciofluvial or alluvial fan deposits.  These deposits have a large component of sandstone, siltstone and shale. Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 48 F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to  45 inches. The frost-free season ranges from 110 to 150 days.  The elevation ranges from 1000 to 1800 feet above sea level."

Bath, Mardin, and Lordstown soils are on adjacent uplands. The competing Trestle soils are often on adjacent slightly higher areas."
