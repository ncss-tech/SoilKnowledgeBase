Boomstick and Phliss soils have channery rock fragments.  Checkett soils are calcareous in all parts.  Cottle soils have silica coatings on rock fragments. Fortyday, Gabbvally, Olac, Thike soils contain less than 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Chubard, Hooplite, Nevo and Rowel soils are less than 36 cm deep. Soughe soils lack an abrupt textural change between the A horizon and the Bt horizon. Richinde and Stewval soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July through September due to convection storms."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Doorkiss soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on summit, shoulder, and backslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rock.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,280 to 2,440 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
