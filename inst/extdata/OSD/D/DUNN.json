  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mollic epipedons are 10 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to the 2Bwb horizon is from 20 to 37 inches.  Depth to carbonates is 20 to 60 inches or more and carbonates, when present, generally occur as a layer of accumulations in the 2Bwb or 2C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  Reaction is moderately acid through neutral.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  Reaction is moderately acid through neutral.\nThe C horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Reaction is medium acid through neutral.  It has faint yellowish brown, reddish brown or brownish yellow redoximorphic concentrations in the soil matrix.\nThe 2Bwb and 2C horizons have hues of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is typically sandy clay loam, but includes loam and clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 24 to 35 percent and averages about 30 percent.  Dark colored sandy material is in the vertical cleavages and cracks.  Yellowish, reddish and brownish redoximorphic concentrations are many or common in the soil matrix.  Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  A gravelly substratum phase with gravelly coarse sand at 40 to 60 inches is recognized."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dunn soils are on concave or low hummocky slopes on uplands and stream terraces.  Slope gradients are dominantly 0 to 3 percent but range 2 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in eolian sands deposited a few feet thick over dense, firm, loamy alluvium.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 24 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F."

The Libory and Boelus soils are on similar landscapes.  Elsmere, Dunday, Pivot and Boelus soils do not have aquic soil conditions and a perched water table within a depth of 40 inches.  Valentine soils have a sandy particle size control section.  Dunday, Pivot and Valentine soils are higher on the landscape.  Elsmere soils are lower on the landscape."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Permeability is rapid in the solum and moderately slow or slow in the underlying material.  Water is ponded for a brief duration in some of the swales and low areas during wet periods.  There is a perched water table that ranges from about 1.5 feet to 3.5 feet during spring and early summer when rainfall is highest.  Runoff is low to negligible."

Consideration should be given to obtaining a different representative pedon or reclassifying to the aquic subgroup.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Lab data available.
