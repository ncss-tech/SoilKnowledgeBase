  "OVERVIEW": "The Darkcanyon series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on hillslopes.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from schist and graywacke. Slopes are 30 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
