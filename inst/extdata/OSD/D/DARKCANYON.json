The particle-size control section averages 60 to 75 percent rock fragments and 25 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 45 to 65 percent channers and 5 to 15 percent flagstones.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or clay loam, averaging 20 to 30 percent clay.  It has 50 to 70 percent channers and 0 to 10 percent flagstones."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from schist and graywacke.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 130 days."

The Chambeam, Lostbasin, and Sinker soils have frigid soil temperatures.  Chambeam and Sinker have mollic epipedons and are pachic.  Harlow and Snell are on adjacent basalt uplands and are clayey-skeletal.  Lostbasin soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Snaker soils are shallow to bedrock."
