The particle-size control section averages 60 to 75 percent rock fragments and 25 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 45 to 65 percent channers and 5 to 15 percent flagstones.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or clay loam, averaging 20 to 30 percent clay.  It has 50 to 70 percent channers and 0 to 10 percent flagstones."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from schist and graywacke.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 130 days."
