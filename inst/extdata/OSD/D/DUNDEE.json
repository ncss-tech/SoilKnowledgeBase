  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are Adaton, Amagon and Tichnor series in the same family. Adaton soils have sola more than 60 inches thick and are poorly drained. Amagon soils have sola greater than 50 inches thick; contain an E horizon and do not contain lithologic discontinuities. Tichnor soils have A and E horizons more than 24 inches thick and contain less sand in the control section."

Slopes range between 0 to 8 percent. The soil formed in thinly stratified beds of loamy alluvium. Climate is warm and humid. Near the type location the mean annual precipitation is 48 inches and mean annual temperature is 64 degrees F."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; runoff is negligible to high depending on slope; moderately slow permeability. In undrained conditions, an apparent water table is about 1.5 to 3.5 feet below the surface during the winter and spring months. Most areas of Dundee soils are used for row\ncrops and are artificially drained by constructed ditches. In drained areas, the water table ranges from 3.5 to 6 feet below the surface."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series was updated in 2004 to expand the C horizon pH range to include slightly alkaline reaction, expand the A horizon thickness to 12 inches, and expand the A horizon pH range to include extremely acid reaction. Preliminary studies have indicated that the depth to saturated layers in these soils may be deeper than it is currently being interpreted over most of the series range. Additional studies have been initiated to determine if the drained hydrology is now the dominant condition. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the type location pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of about 5 inches.\nArgillic horizon - the zone from approximately 5 to 29 inches.\nEndosaturation in the lower part of the argillic and substratum. A large percentage of these soils are artifically drained and do not have aquic conditions within 20 inches of the mineral surface for significant periods in most years.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for 3 pedons, including typical pedon, are published in SSIR No. 13, pp. 56-61, Engineering Test Data for two pedons are published in Soil Survey Coahoma County, Mississippi (issued December 1959) pp. 20-21; for one pedon in Soil Survey Humphreys County,\nMississippi (issued September 1959) pp. 14-15.\nSoil Interpretation Record No. - MS0057\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
