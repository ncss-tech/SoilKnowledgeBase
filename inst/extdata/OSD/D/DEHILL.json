    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth of soil is greater than 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 degrees to 52 degrees F.  The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F from about March 15 to December 1 (255 days) and is above 47 degrees F from about April 15 to November 15 (210 days).  The soil between depths of 8 to 23 inches is dry in all parts from June 15 to until November 10 (145 days).  Moisture control section is dry more than half the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 32 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent of the soil, by volume.  Cobbles range from 0 to 2 percent.  Gravel range from 0 to 3 percent.  Base saturation (sum of cations) is 75 to 100 percent throughout the solum.  Content of organic matter in the solum ranges from 1 to 3 percent.  Content of clay in the 10 or 40 inch particle control section is 10 to 18 percent.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/2, 4/3 or 4/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/3, 3/2 or 2/2.  Clay content ranges from 10 to 16 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/2, 4/3 or 4/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/3 or 3/2.  The Bt horizon average 12 to 18 percent clay with 1 to 2 percent more clay content than the A horizon.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/3, 5/4, 5/3, 4/3 or 4/2 and moist color of 10YR 4/4, 4/3, 3/4, 3/3 or 3/2.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline."

Central Point soils have mean annual temperatures of 52 degrees to 56 degrees F and xeric moisture.  Edmundston soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches and mean annual soil temperatures of 52 degrees to 59 degrees F.  Imbler soils have a xeric moisture regime.  Oak Glen soils are gravelly, slightly acid or medium acid and have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 degrees to 59 degrees F.  Ritter soils are loam in the 10 to 40 inch control, have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches and have 5 to 25 percent basalt pebbles and cobbles in the C horizon.  Steven soils have a mantle of silt loess and ash, are 25 to 40 inches deep to carbonates, and are gravelly loam, loam or silt loam in the particle-size control section.  Uhlig soils have a loam B horizon the upper part of which contains a high component of loess and ash.  All of these soils have a xeric moisture regime."
