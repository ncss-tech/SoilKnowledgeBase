Blanding soils have hue of 5YR and receive appreciably more precipitation in the winter months.  Blanding, Hyer, Nepesta, Tensleep, Wilid, and Wyotite soils do not have measureable amounts of volcanic glass.  Nepesta soils have thick Ap horizons that border anthropic epipedons in amount of nitrogen and phosphorus.  Tensleep, Wilid and Wyolite soils have hue of 10YR or yellower and are more moist in May and June."

They formed in loess derived from Tertiary micaceous sandstone and siltstone over alluvium derived from Precambrian granite and schist; Tertiary micaceous sandstone; and Quaternary rhyolitic pumice.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,500 to 6,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."
