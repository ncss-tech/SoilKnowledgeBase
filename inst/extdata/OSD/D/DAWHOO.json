Similar soils in other families are the Johnston,\nMurville, Osier, Pickney, Plummer, Pocomoke, Polawana, Rutlege,\nand Scranton series.

Osier, Plummer, and Scranton soils do not\nhave an umbric epipedon.  Pocomoke soils have a Bt horizon within\n20 inches of the surface.  Rutlege soils have siliceous\nmineralogy."
