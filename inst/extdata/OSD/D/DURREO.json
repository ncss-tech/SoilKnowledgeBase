  "OVERVIEW": "The Durreo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from basalt, andesite, and rhyolite. Durreo soils are on volcanic hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 6 to 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
