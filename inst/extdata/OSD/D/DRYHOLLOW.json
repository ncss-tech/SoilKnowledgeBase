  "OVERVIEW": "The Dryhollow series consists of very deep, well drained soils on canyons.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from volcanic ash and pumice.  Slopes are 0 to 55 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
