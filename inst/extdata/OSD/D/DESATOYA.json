The climate is cool-semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 9 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."

McConnel soils are sandy-skeletal, have cambic horizons, and occur on adjacent fan remnants and beach terraces.  Ricert soils are fine-loamy, have natric horizons, and occur on adjacent fan remnants."
