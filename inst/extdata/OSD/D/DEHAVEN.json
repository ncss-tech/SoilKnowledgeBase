The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 70 inches.  Mean January temperature is 50 degrees F., mean July temperature is 55 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 290 to 365 days."
