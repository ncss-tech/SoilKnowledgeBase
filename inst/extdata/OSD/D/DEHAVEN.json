The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature ranges from 3 to 6 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 7 and 27 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to August 1 and is dry in some part from September 1 to October 1 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages 25 to 30 percent clay.  Reaction is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/2, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4 or 7/3.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/3 or 4/4.  Where mollic colors occur the thickness requirement for a mollic epipedon is not met.  Gravel content is 15 to 35 percent.  Base saturation (sum) is 50 to 75 percent.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 4/3, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 5/8, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6, 7/3 or 7/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, 4/6, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6 or 6/4.

The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 70 inches.  Mean January temperature is 50 degrees F., mean July temperature is 55 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 290 to 365 days."
