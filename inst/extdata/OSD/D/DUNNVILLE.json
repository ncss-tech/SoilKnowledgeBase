  "OVERVIEW": "The Dunnville series consists of very deep, well drained soils which are moderately deep to sandy alluvium.  They formed in loamy alluvium overlying sandy alluvium on low stream terraces.  Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy alluvium and rapid or very rapid in the sandy alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the loamy alluvium, depth to the base of the cambic horizon, and depth to sandy alluvium all range from 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages from 7 and 17 percent clay and from 45 and 65 percent fine sand or coarser.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the loamy alluvium and from 0 to 35 percent in the sandy alluvium.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the loamy alluvium, but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the sandy alluvium.  Carbonates are absent to 80 inches or more.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 15 inches.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is loamy sand loamy fine sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, fine sand, coarse sand or the gravelly analogs.\nThe 2C horizon has color like the 2BC horizon above.  Texture is sand, coarse sand, fine sand, or the gravelly analogs.  A few thin strata of finer texture are in the 2C horizon in some pedons."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This series is redefined as well drained only.  A new series is needed for the 3040 acres correlated as moderately well drained phase in Marathon County.   New series will also be needed for the mesic versions of these soils mapped in MLRA 105.  Also, lab data is needed on these soils to see if the base saturation is high enough to support their classification as Mollisols.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nmollic epipedon - 0 to 12 inches (Ap, A);\ncambic horizon - 12 to 24 inches (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3)."
