Depth to the lithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments in the control section range from 35 to 70 percent.  They consist mainly of pebbles and cobbles, but can have 10 to 30 percent stones.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry with 20 to 50 percent pebbles, 10 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent stones.\nThe B horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay or clay loam or silty clay loam with an average of 35 to 45 percent clay.  It has moderate or weak subangular blocky structure."

They have formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from Clarno age volcanic tuff.  Average annual precipitation is 9 to 11 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F., mean summer temperature is about 64 degrees F., and mean winter temperature is about 34 degrees F.  Average frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."
