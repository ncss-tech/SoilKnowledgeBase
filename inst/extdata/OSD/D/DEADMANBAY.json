These soils formed in glacial drift underlain by dense glaciomarine deposits. Elevations are 0 to 198 m. The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and mild moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 635 to 1016 mm. The mean annual temperature is 9 to 10 degrees C. The frost-free period is about 200 to 240 days."
