  "OVERVIEW": "The Dynal series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in beach sand and eolian sands derived mainly from oolites.  Dynal soils are on slightly elevated beach ridges and stable dunes.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dynal soils are on slightly elevated beach ridges and stable dunes along the edge of the Great Salt Lake.  They formed in beach sand and eolian sands derived mainly from oolites (ooliths).  Oolites are small, rounded, sand-sized accretionary bodies formed of concentric layers of calcium carbonate around a sand-sized nucleus of mineral or organic origin and formed in wave-agitated waters.  Mineral grains derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rocks are also a component of the soil parent material.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent and are both concave and convex.  Elevation ranges from 4,200 to 4,250 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches, the mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 120 to 160 days."

Saltair soils have salic horizons and a seasonal high water table at or near the surface.  All of these soils generally occur on slightly lower topographic positions than Dynal soils."
