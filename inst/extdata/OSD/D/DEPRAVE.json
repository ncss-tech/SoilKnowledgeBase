  "REVDATE": "12/2015",
  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Deprave series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from granitoid and/or gneissic rocks. Deprave soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 75 millimeters (3 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 25 degrees C (77 degrees F).",
