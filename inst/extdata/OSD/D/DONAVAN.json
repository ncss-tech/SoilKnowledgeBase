These soils formed in mixed volcanic ash over glacial till. Elevations are 1,800 to 4,500 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches. Mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 66 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 130 days."

Bernhill soils are fine-loamy and are on glaciated foothills and glaciolacustrine influenced ground moraines. Borgeau, Dehart, Maki, Nevine, Raisio, Rufus, and Scoap soils are loamy-skeletal. Borgeau soils are on backslopes of hills. Dehart soils are on mountains. Maki soils are on south-facing glaciated uplands and mountainsides. Nevine soils are on moraines, foothills and mountains. Raisio and Rufus soils are on footslopes, sideslopes, and ridgetops of mountains. Scoap soils are on uplands and mountains. Molcal soils have 2Bk horizons and are on uplands. Molson soils are ashy over loamy. Republic soils have a mean soil temperature of 44 to 46 degrees F and are on alluvial fans, terraces and footslopes and backslopes of mountains. Vallan soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to a lithic contact and are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of glacially scoured foothills and mountains."
