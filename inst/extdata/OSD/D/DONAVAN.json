  "OVERVIEW": "The Donavan series consists of moderately deep to a densic contact, well drained soils formed in mixed volcanic ash over glacial till. They are on toeslopes, footslopes, and backslopes of foothills and mountains. Slope ranges from 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.",

Borgeau soils are on backslopes of hills. Dehart soils are on mountains. Maki soils are on south-facing glaciated uplands and mountainsides. Nevine soils are on moraines, foothills and mountains. Raisio and Rufus soils are on footslopes, sideslopes, and ridgetops of mountains. Scoap soils are on uplands and mountains. Molcal soils have 2Bk horizons and are on uplands. Molson soils are ashy over loamy. Republic soils have a mean soil temperature of 44 to 46 degrees F and are on alluvial fans, terraces and footslopes and backslopes of mountains. Vallan soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to a lithic contact and are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of glacially scoured foothills and mountains."
