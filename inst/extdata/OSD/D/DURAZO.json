  "REVDATE": "10/2007",
  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Durazo series consists of very deep, excessively drained, soils that formed in sandy stream alluvium.  Durazo soils are on stream terraces, fan terraces, and dunes. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F.",
