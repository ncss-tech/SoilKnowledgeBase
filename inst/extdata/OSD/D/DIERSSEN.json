  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil between the depths of 6 and 20 inches is usually dry in all parts from mid-June through October and is usually moist in all parts from December to late April.   The mean annual soil temperature is about 62 to 65 degrees F and remains above 47 degrees F throughout the year.  Depth to the duripan is 20 to 40 inches.  The argillic horizon averages 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe Ap horizon is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/3, 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR, 2/2, 3/2.  Texture is sandy loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Most pedons have mottles with chroma greater than 3 in the lower part.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  Organic matter content is 1 to 3 percent.\nThe Btk horizon is 10YR 5/2, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 5/4.  Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/4; 7.5YR 4/4.  It is clay loam or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  Some pedons have mottles with chroma greater than 3 in the upper part.  Reaction ranges from mildly alkaline to moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 5 to 10 percent.\nBkq and Bq horizons are 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/3, 7/4.  Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/3, 5/4; 7.5YR 4/4.  Less than half of the upper boundary is coated with opal or opal and sesquioxides, or durinodes are present.  Silica cementation of the matrix is weak to strong.  Lime is always present in the upper part of the duripan and is sometimes present in the lower part."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dierssen soils are on basin rims.  Elevations range from 0 to 25 feet.  Slope is 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium derived dominantly from granitic rocks.  The climate is characterized by hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 15-18 inches.  Average January temperature is about 45 degrees F; average July temperature is about 75 degrees F; the average annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 250 to 275 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing San Joaquin soils and the Egbert, Galt and Tinnin soils.  Egbert soils lack a duripan and are on the high floodplain.  Galt soils have intersecting slickensides and cracks that open to the surface and are on low terraces.  Tinnin soils are sandy, lack a duripan and are on mounds and ridges on the basin rim."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; very slow runoff; slow permeability.  A perched watertable occurs above the subsoil during the winter and early spring months at a depth of 0.5 to 2 feet.  The hazard of flooding is rare if protected by levees, or occasional.  Periods of flooding are brief to long and occur in the months of December through April."

Although the upper profile is saturated with water during the winter months, there is no provision for an Oxyaquic subgroup. Competing series were not checked at that time.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
