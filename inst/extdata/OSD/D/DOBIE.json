  "STATES": "WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Dobie series consists of well drained soils moderately deep to a paralithic contact of sandstone on hills on bedrock controlled uplands.  These soils formed in loess and in residuum from the underlying fine grained glauconitic sandstone. Permeability is moderate in the subsoil and ranges from slow to moderate in the sandstone.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum, thickness of the loess mantle, and depth to the paralithic contact all range from 20 to 40 inches.  Weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 18 to 27 percent and weighted average content of sand coarser than very fine is less than 15 percent. Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the loess mantle and from 0 to 35 percent in the residuum.  Reaction typically ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum and substratum but ranges to neutral in the Ap and E horizons, where the soil is limed.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Uncultivated pedons have A horizons 1 to 4 inches thick with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.\nDobie soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt horizon described above.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, 5GY or 5G; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 6 .  It is loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or the channery analogs.\nThe 2Cr horizon has color like the 2Bt horizon described above."

The moderately well drained Doritty soils are in lower landscape positions than those of Dobie soils on foot slopes where the loess is more than 60 inches thick.  The well drained Hayriver soils are in landscape positions similar to those of Dobie soils where the loess mantle is absent and the solum is formed entirely in residuum.  The well drained Wickware soils are in lower landscape positions on back slopes and foot slopes where the loess is more than 60 inches thick."
