  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the A and C horizon is more than 80 inches of sand or fine sand.  The soil ranges from extremely acid through moderately alkaline.  Some pedons contain few to common fine to medium brownish organic stains and grayish or whitish mottles. Small calcareous shell fragments are present in some pedons.  The soil contains few to common grains of black, red, pink, dark brown, and white minerals.  Some pedons exhibit a slight to strong sulfur odor below the surface horizons.\nThe Oa or Oe horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is less than 8 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 0 to 2.  The Ab horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It contains few to common pieces of undecomposed plant materials.\nThe Cg horizon and C'g horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 0 to 2, and greenish gray (5GY 5/1, 6/1).   Mottles are in shades of red, yellow, brown, or gray in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Canaveral, Carteret, Corolla, Dello, Lang, Mustang, Osier, Pompano, and Rutlege series.  Canaveral and Corolla soils have lower water tables and chroma of more than 2 and value higher than 4 in the upper C horizon, and in addition, Canaveral soils are hyperthermic.  Carteret soils are in salt water marshes that are flooded at least monthly and in places twice daily.  Dello and Lang soils are at higher elevations, in a dry climate with 10 to 20 inches of rainfall.  Mustang and Pompano soils have a mean annual temperature of more than 72 degrees F.  Osier and Rutlege soils are not affected by storm tides.  In addition, Osier soils have more than 5 percent silt plus clay and Rutlege soils have an umbric epipedon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Duckston soils are mainly in shallow depressions between coastal dunes and on nearly level flats between the dunes and marshes generally at elevations less than 5 feet above mean tide level.  Slopes are typically less than 2 percent and surfaces are plane to concave.  The soil formed in sandy sediments reworked by waves and wind.   Average annual precipitation near the type location is about 48 inches and mean annual temperature about 62 degrees F.  The soils are periodically flooded with salt water; salinity is variable according to length of time since last flooding."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  In addition to the competing Carteret and Corolla series these are the Capers, Currituck, Fripp, and Newhan series.  Capers soils are finer textured and are in salt water marshes that are flooded at least once a month or in places twice daily.  Currituck soils are organic and are flooded with fresh water.  Fripp and Newhan soils are not saturated with water and are on the higher parts of the landscape."
