  "STATES": "NE",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Doane series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in calcareous, loamy and sandy eolian material on valley sideslopes and uplands. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches.",

Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8 (4 to 6 moist) and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  Sandy textures are common at depths below 40 inches.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Jayem and Sarben soils are on similar landscape positions and do not have carbonates at depths less than 15 inches.  Jayem soils also have a mollic epipedon.  Sully and Ulysses soils are usually higher on the landscape and have less sand in the series control sections.  Kanorado soils are on similar landscape positions, have more clay in the series control sections, and are deep over shale.  Valent soils have a sandy series control section and are usually higher on the landscape.\nDrainage and Permeability:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Runoff is slow or medium depending on the degree of slope."

    "content": "REMARKS:  The Doane soils were previously mapped with the Colby and Anselmo soils in the 1963 soil survey of Dundy County and with the Otero soils in Cheyenne County, Kansas.  Doane soils are coarser textured than Colby soils and have carbonates higher in the profile than Anselmo soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon:  ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of about 4 inches (the A horizon)."
