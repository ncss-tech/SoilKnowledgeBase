Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8 (4 to 6 moist) and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bigbend, Jayem, Kanorado, Sarben, Sully, Ulysses and Valent soils.  Bigbend soils are coarse-silty and are lower on the landscape.  Jayem and Sarben soils are on similar landscape positions and do not have carbonates at depths less than 15 inches.  Jayem soils also have a mollic epipedon.  Sully and Ulysses soils are usually higher on the landscape and have less sand in the series control sections.  Kanorado soils are on similar landscape positions, have more clay in the series control sections, and are deep over shale.  Valent soils have a sandy series control section and are usually higher on the landscape.\nDrainage and Permeability:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Runoff is slow or medium depending on the degree of slope."
