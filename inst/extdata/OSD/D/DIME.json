Corazones soils do not receive significant precipitation during winter months. Nickel and Railroad soils have Bw horizons, are deeper to a calcic horizon, and allow redder hues in all horizons. Nickel soils also have darker chromas in the A and Bk horizons, have fewer cobbles, and no stones in any horizon. In addition, Nickel soils allow bedrock between 40 and 60 inches; and Railroad soils have finer textures and bedrock within 40 inches. Stagecoach soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section for more than 20 days cumulative betwen July and September."
