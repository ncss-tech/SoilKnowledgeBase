    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Corazones (TX), Nickel (NV), Railroad (T NV), and Stagecoach (AZ) series. Corazones soils do not receive significant precipitation during winter months. Nickel and Railroad soils have Bw horizons, are deeper to a calcic horizon, and allow redder hues in all horizons. Nickel soils also have darker chromas in the A and Bk horizons, have fewer cobbles, and no stones in any horizon. In addition, Nickel soils allow bedrock between 40 and 60 inches; and Railroad soils have finer textures and bedrock within 40 inches. Stagecoach soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section for more than 20 days cumulative betwen July and September."

Elevations are 1,800 to 2,600 feet. The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm winters. Most precipitation comes in the winter but in some areas it is sporadic. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches. The mean annual temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F. Mean July temperature is about 78 degrees F., and mean January temperature is about 42 degrees F. The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."
