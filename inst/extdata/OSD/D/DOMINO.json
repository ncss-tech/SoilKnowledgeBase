  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the indurated lime hardpan ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The soils are usually dry from early May to sometime in December.  They are moist in some parts of the moisture control section (4 to 12 inches depth) all the remaining time.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 59 degrees to 71 degrees F.  The control section is dominantly heavy silt loam, light silty clay loam or heavy loam.  The fine sand and coarser fraction exceeds 15 percent.  The CaCO3 equivalent in the control section is 15 to 40 percent.  The pH ranges from 8.0 to 8.8.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown, light brownish gray or pale brown in 10YR or 2.5Y.  It ranges from fine sandy loam to silt loam and may be saline.\nThe Ccam horizon contains few to many fractures that are commonly filled with carbonates.  A sequence of hard and soft horizons may be repeated.  The hardest layers do no slake in water and dry soil is not penetrated by spade.  Lower C horizons are saline and are strongly alkaline in some pedons."

Bellavista soils have silica-indurated hardpans and have mean annual soil temperature below 59 degrees F.  Bit soils are coarse-loamy, have more than 40 percent CaCO3 and have mean annual soil temperature below 59 degrees F.  Bridge and Sunrise soils lack indurated calcic horizons.  Cave soils lack a moisture regime bordering on Xeric."

Average January temperature is 49 degrees F., the average July temperature is 77 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 230 to 280 days."

Traver soils have argillic horizons with exchangeable sodium percentage greater than 15 percent in some part.  Waukena soils have natric horizons.  Willows soils are of fine texture throughout and crack on drying."
