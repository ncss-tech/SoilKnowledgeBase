    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 41 to 89 cm. Depth to bedrock is more than 150 cm. Rock fragment content in individual horizons of the particle-size control section ranges from 15 to 65 percent, but the weighted average is more than 35 percent by volume. In some pedons rock fragments in the C horizon range up to 80 percent. The rock fragment content of the upper 25 cm of the mineral soil ranges from 5 to 55 percent. Stones and boulders cover up to 15 percent of the surface. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the solum and from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the substratum.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 2 to 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It has weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular structure or it is massive. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Ap or A horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. It is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular structure. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak or moderate very fine or fine granular or thin platy structure. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bhs horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR with a value and chroma of 3 or less. It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It has weak or moderate, very fine or fine, granular or blocky structure. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, with value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 8. It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak or moderate, very fine to medium, granular or blocky structure.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Winnecook series. It is moderately deep to bedrock. The Blandburg, Larrupin, Littlejohn and Pitcher series are closely related series from outside Region R. Blandburg soils have a solum greater than 89 cm thick and formed in material from weathered sandstone. Larrupin and Pitcher soils have a volcanic ash mantle and are less acid. Littlejohn soils are moderately deep to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Danforth soils are on till plains, ground moraines, or on the middle to lower slopes of ridges, hills, and mountains. Slope ranges from 3 to 45 percent. The soils formed in supraglacial melt-out till derived from slate, fine-grained metasandstone, and to a lesser extent granite, gneiss, or schist. The climate is humid and cool temperate. The mean annual temperature ranges from 2 to 9 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 790 to 1640 mm. The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 35 to 735 meters above mean sea level."

Chesuncook, Daigle, Perham, Telos and Monarda soils are on smoother landscapes and they have dense glacial till substratums. Elliottsville and Winnecook soils (both moderately deep to bedrock) and Monson and Thorndike soils (both shallow to bedrock) are in higher positions on the landscape. Masardis soils are somewhat excessively drained and are on adjacent glaciofluvial landforms. Peacham soils are very poorly drained and are in lower depressional positions on the landscape. Shirley soils are moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained and are in lower positions on the landscape."
