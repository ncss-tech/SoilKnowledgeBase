  "STATES": "ME",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Danforth series consists of very deep, well drained soils on till plains and ridges. These soils formed in glacial till derived from slate and fine grained metasandstone and lesser amounts of granite, gneiss or schist. Estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum and high or very high in the substratum. Slope ranges from 3 to 45 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation is about 1175mm.",

The Blandburg, Larrupin, Littlejohn and Pitcher series are closely related series from outside Region R. Blandburg soils have a solum greater than 89 cm thick and formed in material from weathered sandstone. Larrupin and Pitcher soils have a volcanic ash mantle and are less acid. Littlejohn soils are moderately deep to bedrock."

The soils formed in supraglacial melt-out till derived from slate, fine-grained metasandstone, and to a lesser extent granite, gneiss, or schist. The climate is humid and cool temperate. The mean annual temperature ranges from 2 to 9 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 790 to 1640 mm. The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 35 to 735 meters above mean sea level."

Chesuncook, Daigle, Perham, Telos and Monarda soils are on smoother landscapes and they have dense glacial till substratums. Elliottsville and Winnecook soils (both moderately deep to bedrock) and Monson and Thorndike soils (both shallow to bedrock) are in higher positions on the landscape. Masardis soils are somewhat excessively drained and are on adjacent glaciofluvial landforms. Peacham soils are very poorly drained and are in lower depressional positions on the landscape. Shirley soils are moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained and are in lower positions on the landscape."
