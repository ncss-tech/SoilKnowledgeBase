  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dearbush soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on concave-linear upper and mid-elevation mountain backslopes.  These soils formed in colluvium derived from metamorphic rocks, granite or rhyolite.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 2,600 to 3,125 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  Snow load on these soils is thicker and persists longer as a result of windblown snow accumulation from nearby geomorphic surfaces.  The mean annual precipitation is 610 to 710 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days."

Inpendence soils have a base saturation of 10 to 30 percent, reaction of very strongly acid to moderately acid. Hapgood soils have a lithic contact between 100 to 150 cm, clay percent of 18 to 27 percent in the particle size control section, and winter precipitation is regularly removed from this site by winds. Tusel soils have a lithic contact at 100 cm and clay percent of 25 to 35 percent in the particle size control section. Wrenza soils have a base saturation of 10 to 50 percent, a reaction of moderately acid to slightly acid, and receive increased moisture as run on from snow melt."
