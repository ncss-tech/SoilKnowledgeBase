Depth to redox accumulations ranges from 24 to 40 inches. Gravel content ranges from 1 to 10 percent in the loamy upper part and from 10 to 25 percent in the sandy lower part. Cobbles range from 0 to 15 percent, stones from 0 to 10 percent, and boulders from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon. Mean annual soil temperature is about 41 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the cobbly analogues. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or the cobbly analogues. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or the cobbly analogues. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bs1 horizon has hue of 5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4. It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or the cobbly analogues. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bs2 horizon has hue 5YR to 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, or the cobbly analogues. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid. Coarse fragment content averages less than 35 percent in the A, E, Bhs and Bs horizons.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is very stony loamy sand or the gravelly, cobbly, and stony analogues. Reaction is strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is very stony loamy sand or the gravelly, cobbly, stony analogues. Reaction is strongly acid to moderately acid. Coarse fragment content  averages 35 percent or more in some pedons in the 2BC and 2C horizons.\nThe underlying bedrock is igneous or metamorphic. Very thin weathered layers are present on the bedrock surface in some pedons."

The Chabeneau soils lack a lithic contact within 60 inches of the soil surface.  The Chocolay, Carlshend and Reade soils are underlain by sandstone or limestone bedrock and lack the sandy and gravelly layer above the rock."

These soils formed in a silty or loamy eolian deposits over sandy and gravelly till overlying igneous, conglomerate or metamorphic bedrock. Elevation ranges from 1100 to 1800 feet. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 33 to 38 inches and mean annual temperature is about 38 to 40 degrees F."
