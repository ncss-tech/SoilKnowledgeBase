  "OVERVIEW": "The Dishno series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils. They formed in a silty or loamy eolian deposits over sandy and gravelly till underlain by igneous or metamophic bedrock. These soils are on bedrock controlled moraines. Permeability is moderate in the loamy material and moderately rapid in the sandy material. Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent but are typically below 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees.",
