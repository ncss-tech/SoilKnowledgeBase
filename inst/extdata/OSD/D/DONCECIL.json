  "OVERVIEW": "The Doncecil series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in colluvium derived from granitic rocks. Doncecil soils are on mountain slopes in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Slopes range from 20 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 985 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
