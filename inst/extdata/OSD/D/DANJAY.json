  "OVERVIEW": "The Danjay series consists of moderately deep, excessively drained soils that formed in residuum derived from noncalcareous sandstone.  Danjay soils are on shoulders and backslopes of ridges in mountains.  Slopes range from 6 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
