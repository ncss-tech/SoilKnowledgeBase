(Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on October 9, 2008 the soil was slightly moist.\nOe--0 to 3 cm; moderately decomposed pine needles, twigs, and herbaceous litter.  (O horizon is 1 to 4 cm thick)\nA--3 to 9 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loamy fine sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and  fine, few medium and coarse roots; about 15 percent weakly to moderately cemented, subrounded and subangular gravel-sized sandstone parafragments; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 23 cm thick)\nAC--9 to 25 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; about 35 percent sandstone rock fragments, of which 10 percent are strongly and very strongly cemented, subrounded and subangular gravel, and 25 percent are weakly to moderately cemented, subrounded and subangular gravel-sized parafragments; slightly acid; clear irregular boundary.  (0 to 25 cm thick)\nC--25 to 75 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) cobbly fine sand, very pale brown (10YR 8/4) dry; massive parting to single grain; loose, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; about 70 percent sandstone fragments, of which about 10 percent are cobble, 5 percent are subrounded and subangular gravel, 25 percent are cobble-size parafragments, and 25 percent are gravel-sized parafragments; neutral; clear irregular boundary.  (48 to 76 cm thick)\nCr--75 to 122 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) to very pale brown (10YR 8/4), weakly to moderately cemented, noncalcareous sandstone; material is fractured and breaks into angular and subangular cobble and stone size fragments; slightly alkaline. (20 to 50 cm thick)\nR--122 to 200 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 5/4) to light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), very strongly cemented to indurated, noncalcareous sandstone."
