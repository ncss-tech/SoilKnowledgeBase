  "OVERVIEW": "The Dana series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loess or other silty materials and in the underlying loamy  till on till plains. Permeability is moderate. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 10 degrees C (50 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 991 mm (39 inches).",
