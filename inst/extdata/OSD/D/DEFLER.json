  "OVERVIEW": "The Defler series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash. The Defler soils are on inset fans. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
