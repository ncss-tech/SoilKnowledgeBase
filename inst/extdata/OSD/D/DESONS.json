  "OVERVIEW": "The Desons series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from schist or phyllite rock types.  Desons soils occur on broad ridgetops and stable benches of coastal hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 85 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

The soils formed in deep, fine-textured residuum and colluvium derived from schist and phyllite rock types of the Colebrooke Schist Formation.  Elevations are 100 to 1000 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and cool, moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 95 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 200 to 270 days."
