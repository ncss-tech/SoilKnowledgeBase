The soils are usually moist but are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay and has 15 to 30 percent total rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The solum is 40 to 60 inches thick.  Soil reaction is strongly acid to very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It is channery clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 15 to 25 percent channers and 0 to 5 percent flagstones.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and 6 through 8 dry.  It is channery silty clay, channery clay, or channery silty clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay.

Bentilla soils have redoximorphic features of mottles with chroma of 2 or less at depths of 22 to 30 inches and are moderately well drained.  Cunniff soils have an umbric epipedon 10 to 16 inches thick and less than 15 percent angular rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Klooqueh soils have a mean annual soil temperature greater than 54 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Desons soils are on stable broad ridgetops and benches of coastal hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The soils formed in deep, fine-textured residuum and colluvium derived from schist and phyllite rock types of the Colebrooke Schist Formation.  Elevations are 100 to 1000 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and cool, moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 95 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 200 to 270 days."

Calfranch soils are loamy-skeletal.  Watches soils are fine-loamy."
