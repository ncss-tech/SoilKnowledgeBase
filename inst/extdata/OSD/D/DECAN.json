In 2009 the ecological site correlation was changed from a woodland potential to a rangeland potential based on soil properties.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 20 cm (A1, A2 and Bt1 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 8 to 58 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Btk horizons).\nDuripan - The zone from 58 to 88 cm (Bqkm horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 8 to 58 cm (Bt1, Bt2 and Btk horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Previous authors and editors include: DJM-RLB.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
