It has 30 to 50 percent gravel and 5 to 20 percent cobbles.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist to a depth of 20 inches or more, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry; below 20 inches the value is 2 through 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.

The soils formed in medium textured gravelly and cobbly colluvium weathered from tuffaceous sandstone and siltstone.  The climate is a modified maritime climate with an annual precipitation of 70 to 110 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 145 to 240 days."
