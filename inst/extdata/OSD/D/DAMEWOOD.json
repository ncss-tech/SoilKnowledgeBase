  "OVERVIEW": "The Damewood series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from sandstone.  Damewood soils are on uplands and have slopes of 30 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

Umbric epipedon 20 to 40 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is strongly to moderately acid.  It has 30 to 50 percent gravel and 5 to 20 percent cobbles.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist to a depth of 20 inches or more, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry; below 20 inches the value is 2 through 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.
