  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arnett, Cobb, Grandfield, Grandmore, Honeycreek, Hye, Lou, McKnight, Menard, and Rochelle series.  Arnett, Grandfield, Grandmore, Menard, and Rochelle soils do not have bedrock within 80 inches.  In addition, Arnett and Rochelle soils contain more than 5 percent coarse fragments of rounded quartzite.  Cobb and Hye soils are less than 40 inches deep to sandstone.  Honeycreek soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Lou soils are moderately deep to granite grus.  McKnight soils formed in Pleistocene age sediments that are deep to a lithological discontinuity with a Cr horizon of weathered Permian claystone and sandstone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Decobb soils are on nearly level to gently sloping convex ridgecrests and side slopes on uplands of southwestern Oklahoma and northcentral Texas.  These soils formed in loamy sediments weathered from weakly cemented sandstone of the Permian age San Angelo Formation.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 28 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 64 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 200 to 230 and elevation ranges from 1,000 to 2,100 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 32 to 44."

Cobb soils are on adjoining higher landscape positions.  Cosh and Quinlan soils are less than 20 inches deep to sandstone and are on higher convex landscape positions.  Grandfield, Madge, and Miles soils are more than 80 inches deep to bedrock and formed in alluvial terrace sediments on lower landscape positions.  In addition, Madge soils have a mollic epipedon.  Tillman and Westill soils have a mollic epipedon, a fine particle-size control section, and are on lower landscape positions.  Tilvern and Vernon soils have a cambic horizon, a fine particle-size control section, are less than 60 inches deep to bedrock, and are lower in the landscape."

Native grasses consist of a mixture of tall, mid, and short grasses such as little bluestem, grama species, and buffalograss.  Mesquite trees invade if not controlled."
