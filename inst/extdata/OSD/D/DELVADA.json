Elevations range from 1,250 to 1,525 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."

Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  A drained phase has an apparent seasonal high water table between 122 and 150 cm (deep free water occurrence class) between February and July. These soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for very long periods between February and July.  The drained phase is susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods between year-round."
