  "REVDATE": "08/2002",
  "STATES": "ID,WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Dufort series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial till with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately rapid in the underlying material.  These soils are on foothills and mountains and have slopes ranging from 0 to 65 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
