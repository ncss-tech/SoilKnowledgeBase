  "OVERVIEW": "The Dunderberg series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks with additions of volcanic ash.  Dunderberg soils are on moraines.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

They formed in till derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granodiorite, andesite, schist, and gneiss with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 8,000 to 9,500 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches, mean annual temperature is 36 to 40 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days."
