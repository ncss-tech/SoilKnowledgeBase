Langrell, Murken and Raster soils are usually dry for less than 90 days and are not dominated by 2 to 5 mm gravel. Packard soils have a loam or clay particle-size control section with 25 to 35 percent clay. Watterson soils have lack a cambic horizon. Wrenthan soils have a silt loam or silty clay loam particle-size control section."
