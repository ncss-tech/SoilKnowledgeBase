Colma, Facey, Foehlin and Ladd soils are deeper than 40 inches to a lithic or paralithic contact. Dragoon and Glenrose have a loess mantel or contain a large component of loess and have a large amount of silt and very fine sand. Gerig soils have formed on weathered tuffs at depths of 20 to 40 inches and have a large amount of pyroclastic materials but less than 60 percent. Lobitos, Los Gatos and Mehlhorn soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Also, Lobitos and Los Gatos have less than 20 degrees difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures. Taneum and Tieton soils lack a paralithic contact within a depth of 40 inches. Also, Taneum soils are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days, have a large amount of loess with 15 to 30 percent sand and 40 to 55 percent silt. Also, Tieton soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments, have a large amount of loess, with 15 to 30 percent sand and 40 to 55 percent silt, and are dry for 80 to 90 days. Tweedy soils are dry for 140 to 150 days and have less than 15 percent rock fragments."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Duzel soils are on mountainous uplands. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. The soils formed fn colluvium and materials weathered from metamorphosed igneous or sedimentary rocks. Elevations are 2,200 to 5,000 feet. The climate is continental and subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 24 inches. Seasonal snowfall is 18 to 24 inches. Mean January temperature is 28 to 37 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F. Frost-free season is 80 to 150 days."
