Colma, Facey, Foehlin and Ladd soils are deeper than 40 inches to a lithic or paralithic contact. Dragoon and Glenrose have a loess mantel or contain a large component of loess and have a large amount of silt and very fine sand. Gerig soils have formed on weathered tuffs at depths of 20 to 40 inches and have a large amount of pyroclastic materials but less than 60 percent. Lobitos, Los Gatos and Mehlhorn soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Also, Lobitos and Los Gatos have less than 20 degrees difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures. Taneum and Tieton soils lack a paralithic contact within a depth of 40 inches. Also, Taneum soils are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days, have a large amount of loess with 15 to 30 percent sand and 40 to 55 percent silt. Also, Tieton soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments, have a large amount of loess, with 15 to 30 percent sand and 40 to 55 percent silt, and are dry for 80 to 90 days. Tweedy soils are dry for 140 to 150 days and have less than 15 percent rock fragments."
