  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Deloro series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium dominantly from shale, schist, phyllite or sandstone.  Deloro soils are on pediments, hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
