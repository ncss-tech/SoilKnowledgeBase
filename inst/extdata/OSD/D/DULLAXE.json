  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Dullaxe series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from granitic or metamorphic rocks with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  They are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and moderately rapid or rapid in the lower part. Slopes range from 10 to 75 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
