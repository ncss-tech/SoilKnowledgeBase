  "OVERVIEW": "The Duluth series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in a friable mantle of loamy eolian or glaciofluvial deposits and in the underlying firm loamy till on moraines and till plains.  Slopes range from 6 to 45 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C. and mean annual precipitation is about 711 millimeters.",
