  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid throughout, except where the surface has been limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Content of ironstone pebbles range from 0 to 35 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay, or their gravelly analogs.\nThe upper part of the Bo horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 4 or 6. Content of ironstone pebbles range from 15 to 50 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay or their gravelly analogs.\nThe lower part of the Bo horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 3 or 6. Content of ironstone pebbles range from 5 to 45 percent, by volume. Texture is clay or their gravelly analogs."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Delicias soils are on foot slopes and alluvial fans in the Humid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  Slopes range from 5 to 20 percent.  They formed in fine textured colluvium from soils weathered from serpentinite bedrock.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 60 to 70 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 75 to 79 degrees F."

Nipe soils are on higher positions and have lower cation retention capacity. Rosario soils are on higher positions and are moderately deep to serpentinite bedrock."

The classification was updated with the 4/91 draft from Clayey, oxic, isohyperthermic Typic Haplorthox to Fine, ferruginous, isohyperthermic Rhodic Haplustox. The previous OSED was dated 4/87. After much evaluation, further updates to classification includes changing the moisture regime to Udic in 10/02. These soils were formerly included in the Nipe series.\nDelicias soils are in MLRA 270.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization pedon - Cabo Rojo Municipality, Puerto Rico; S04PR-023-021R.
