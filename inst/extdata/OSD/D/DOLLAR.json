The solum ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid.  Depth to the fragipan is 20 to 40 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 14 to 30 inches thick.\nThe A horizon is very dark brown to dark brown.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and moist chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, moist value of 2 through 4, and moist chroma of 2 through 6.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 24 to 42 inches.\nThe Bx horizons have hue of 5YR through 10YR, moist value of 3 or 4, and moist chroma of 3 through 6.  Depth to mottles with moist chroma of 2 or less exceeds 30 inches.  The 10- to 32-inch control section is dominantly loam with more than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand."
