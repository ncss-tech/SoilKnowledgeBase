Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches or more. Depth to calcareous material ranges from 24 to 50 inches. These soils are calcareous in the C horizon, but they do not have a consistent accumulation of secondary calcium carbonate. Rock fragments, mainly stones, range from 0 to 35 percent.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist and chroma of 2 through 4. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4. This horizon is clay loam or clay averaging 35 to 50 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR. It is moderately or strongly alkaline."
