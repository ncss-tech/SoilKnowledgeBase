  "OVERVIEW": "The Dicecreek series consists of shallow, well drained soils on mountain sideslopes.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sedimentary rocks.  Slopes are 30 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 80 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 25 to 35 percent clay and 5 to 35 percent rock fragments.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It is clay loam, gravelly clay loam, or gravelly silty clay loam.  It has 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 5 to 35 percent gravel.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.  Base saturation by ammonium acetate is estimated to be 35 to 60 percent."

The soils formed in residuum and colluvium from siltstone and sandstone of the Tenmile Member of the Lookingglass Formation.  Slopes are 30 to 60 percent. Elevations are 800 to 2200 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches.  The frost free period is 120 to 200 days."

Chimneyrock are deep, loamy-skeletal, and over conglomerate.  Vermisa soils are loamy-skeletal.  Windygap soils are fine textured and are deep.  Atring, Beekman, and Vermisa soils are present on adjacent more steeply sloping positions."
