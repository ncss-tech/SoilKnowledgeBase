Mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.\nThe A and Bt horizons range from 24 to 36 inches thick.  The mollic epipedon is less than 20 inches thick and organic matter decreases regularly or reaches levels less than 0.5 percent within a depth of 50 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  It contains 10 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe BAt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value or 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It contains 20 to 30 percent rock fragments.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR and chroma of 3 through 5.  It contains 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.  It is medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 to 8 dry, 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. Rock fragments range from 15 to 70 percent in the upper part and from 35 to 70 percent in the lower part. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 55 percent."

They formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from sedimentary parent rocks.  The climate is dry subhumid.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F. mean summer temperature is 68 to 70 degrees F. and average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches.  The freeze-free period is 100 to 150 days."
