  "OVERVIEW": "The Dry Creek series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from sedimentary rocks.  Dry Creek soils are on pre-Bonneville fans and lower mountainsides.  Slopes are 3 to 60 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The mollic epipedon is less than 20 inches thick and organic matter decreases regularly or reaches levels less than 0.5 percent within a depth of 50 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  It contains 10 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe BAt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value or 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It contains 20 to 30 percent rock fragments.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR and chroma of 3 through 5.  It contains 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.  It is medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 to 8 dry, 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.
