  "OVERVIEW": "The Demogul series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains.  These soils formed in colluvium weathered  from mica schist.  Slope ranges from 15 to 90 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",

The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from mid March to early December and exceeds 47 degrees F from about April 20 to November 10.  The particle-size control section contains from 27 to 35 percent clay, 15 to 25 percent mica minerals in the very fine sand fraction, and averages 20 to 30 percent rock fragments.  The particle-size control section has a ratio of extractable iron plus gibbsite to clay of 0.2 to 0.3.\nThe A horizon is 5YR 7/3, 6/4, 7.5YR 6/4, or 5/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 5YR 3/4, or 10YR 3/4.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon is 7.5YR 6/6, 7/6, 5/6, 5/4, 6/4, 6/6, 5YR 5/6, 6/6, 5/8, 2.5YR 5/6, or 4/8.  Moist color is 5YR 5/6, 4/6, 4/4, 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, 2.5YR 4/6, 4/8 or 5/6.  Chroma is more than 4 in the lower part.  The Bt horizon is gravelly clay loam or gravelly sandy clay loam but may be very gravelly clay loam, or very gravelly sandy clay loam in the lower part.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.  The base saturation is 50 to 75 percent by sum of cations."
