  "STATUS": "Established Series",

  "REVDATE": "02/2006",
  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Denaud series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, moderately permeable soils with a thin organic layer over sandy and loamy material in depressions on the fringes of the Everglades.  They formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 54 inches.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.",

Some pedons may contain fragmented, discontinuous limestone or cemented carbonates at a depth of 40 inches or more.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2, and chroma of 1.  Mineral content ranges up to 70 percent.  Texture is muck.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  Organic matter content ranges up to 20 percent.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, or their mucky analogues.\nThe AC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5B, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3. Soft masses of calcium carbonate range from none to common.  Texture ranges from loamy fine sand to sandy clay loam.\nThe 2Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5B, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Content of cemented carbonates or ironstone nodules 2 to 10mm in size range up to 20 percent, by volume.  Texture ranges from fine sand to sandy clay loam or gravelly fine sand to gravelly sandy loam with or without sand-size shell fragments and cemented carbonates.\nThe 3Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 5Y to 5B, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1. Texture is sand or fine sand."

With the exception of Gator, these soils lack an organic surface layer 8 or more inches thick.  The very poorly drained or poorly drained Basinger soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and have a weakly expressed Spodic horizon.  Chobee soils are on similar positions, have fine-loamy control sections, and are Mollisols.  Delray soils are on similar positions, have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches thick, and are Mollisols.  Gator soils are on similar positions, and are Histosols, having muck layers greater than 16 inches in thickness.  Gentry soils are on similar positions, have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick, and are Mollisols.  The very poorly or poorly drained Holopaw soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches thick.  The very poorly or poorly drained Pineda soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick.  The poorly drained Riviera soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick.  The poorly drained Winder soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and have fine-loamy control sections."
