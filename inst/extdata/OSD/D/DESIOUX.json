  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were previously included in the Lomax series in Missouri. They differ from the Lomax soils by being coarse-silty in the particle-size control section rather than coarse-loamy. The name is derived from a town near the type location.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 104 centimeters (41 inches) (Ap and A horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from approximately 104 to 170 centimeters (41 inches to 67 inches) (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri; Pedon ID M0718330 is data for the OSD typical pedon; Pedons ID M0718336, M0718342, M0718331, M0718335, M0718333, and M0718340, are additional data used for the series range in characteristics.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
