    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 32 to 60 inches.  The cation exchange capacity ranges from about 15 to 50 percent, saturated with exchangeable aluminum within 30 inches of the soil surface.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.  In severely eroded pedons, the Ap horizon can have colors and textures similar to the Bw horizon or the upper part of the Bt horizon.\nThe Bw horizon or the BA horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Texture is silt loam or loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe Bt horizon has ped surfaces or matrix colors with hue of 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 6.  Ped interiors have colors as given for ped surfaces or they have hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4.  Texture of the Bt horizon is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam. Total sand content in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon ranges from 10 to 35 percent with less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand .  Reaction of the Bt horizon ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam. Reaction  ranges from very strongly acid  to medium acid.  Black stains are evident on peds in most pedons.\nThe 3C horizon is typically fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand but ranges to sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.  In some pedons the 3C horizon is stratified."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Armour, Barnsdall, Dossman, Goodwill, and Hicks series in the same family and the Atwood, Dubbs, Gallion, Lexington, Memphis, Rilla, Silerton, and Vian series.  Armour soils have silty clay loam to clay BC horizons that contain chert fragments. The Barnsdall soils are drier for longer periods of time.  Dossman soils formed in loess and contain less total sand in the textural control section.  The Bt horizon of Goodwill, Dubbs, and Memphis soils have ped surfaces that have hues of 10YR and 7.5YR, and in addition, Memphis soils have less than 5 percent total sand to a depth of 48 inches. Hicks soils have a Bt horizon in colors of 10YR or 7.5YR hue, and the Bt contains coarse fragments.  Atwood, Lexington, and Vian soils have sola greater than 60 inches thick.  Gallion and Rilla soils have base saturation greater than 60 percent at a depth of 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon.  Rilla soils have silty ped coatings in the Bt horizon, and Gallion soils are medium acid to mildly alkaline in the Bt horizon.  Silerton soils have base saturation less than 35 percent at 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon."

They occur mostly on low terraces of the Mississippi River or its tributaries.  The climate is warm and humid.  Average annual rainfall ranges from about 45 to 60 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 60 to 70 degrees F."
