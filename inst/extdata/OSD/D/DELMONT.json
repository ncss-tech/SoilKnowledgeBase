  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to calcium carbonate ranges from 14 to 20 inches, and corresponds to the depth of the underlying sand and gravel, which contains 20 to 45 percent gravel by volume. Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is loam but is very fine sandy loam or silt loam in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is loam but is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nA BC or Bk horizon is in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y; value of 5 to 7, 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is gravelly sand, gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly loamy sand, or very gravelly sand and the sand fraction is medium and coarse.  Some pedons have horizons that do not have coarse fragments. Some pedons have thin layers of loamy material.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  The gravel typically is crusted and coated with calcium carbonate on the undersides, especially in the upper part."

Slope gradients range from 0 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in loamy alluvium overlying sand and gravel. The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation from 17 to 26 inches."

Blendon and Henkin soils do not have sand and gravel within depths of 40 inches and have a coarse-loamy control section.  Dempster and Enet soils have sand and gravel between 20 and 40 inches.  Talmo soils have sand and gravel substrata at depths of less than 14 inches."
