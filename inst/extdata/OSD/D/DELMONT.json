  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. WFJ-WJB",
  "REVDATE": "03/2009",
  "STATES": "SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Delmont series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in loamy alluvium over sand and gravel on outwash plains and terraces.  Permeability is moderately rapid or moderate in the solum and rapid in the underlying sand and gravel.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to calcium carbonate ranges from 14 to 20 inches, and corresponds to the depth of the underlying sand and gravel, which contains 20 to 45 percent gravel by volume. Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is loam but is very fine sandy loam or silt loam in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is loam but is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nA BC or Bk horizon is in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y; value of 5 to 7, 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is gravelly sand, gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly loamy sand, or very gravelly sand and the sand fraction is medium and coarse.  Some pedons have horizons that do not have coarse fragments. Some pedons have thin layers of loamy material.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  The gravel typically is crusted and coated with calcium carbonate on the undersides, especially in the upper part."
