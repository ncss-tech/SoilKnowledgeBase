    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for more than half of the time when the temperature is above 41 degrees F.  TThe mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Dark lithochromatic colors continue below 20 inches, but the organic matter is less than one percent.  The particle-size control section averages 5 to 18 percent clay, 45 to 75 percent sand, and 35 to 70 percent rock fragments.  Lenses of coarser material may occur anywhere in the profile.  Soil reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout the profile.  Depth to secondary carbonate accumulation is 30 to 44 inches.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is coarse sandy loam with 5 to 15 percent clay.  It has 5 to 15 percent stones, 20 to 30 percent cobbles, and 10 to 20 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is coarse sandy loam or loam with 5 to 18 percent clay.  It has 10 to 20 percent stones, 15 to 25 percent cobbles, and 10 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.

Haystack soils are on alluvial fans and average 15 to 25 percent clay in the control section.  Heytou soils are moderately deep to dense glacial till.  Nighthawk soils have greater than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the control section.  Olex soils have 12 to 25 inch thick silt loam mantle over a skeletal discontinuity.  Peshastin soils have carbonates at a depth of 15 to 27 inches.  Redcanyon soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Strat soils have sandy textures in the lower part of the particle size control section expressed as a Bkq horizon."
