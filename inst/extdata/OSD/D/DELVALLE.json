    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Begay, Ignacio, Kitsili, Koshare, Ojito, Parida, Remmit, Sandspring (T), and Turnback series.  All of these soils have a combination of value and chroma that exclude the color from being mollic.  In addition, Begay, Ignacio, Kitsili, Parida, Sandspring, and Turnback soils have Bw horizons.  Ignacio, Ojito, and Turnback soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Koshare soils are over 27 inches to the base of the cambic horizon.  Remmit soils have cambic horizons that have Bt designations. In addition, Remmit and Turnback soils are in the Western Great Plains (LRR-G) and are more moist in May and June."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Delvalle soils are on treads of high stream terraces.  They formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,400 to 7,300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."
