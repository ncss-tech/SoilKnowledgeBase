    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  Elevations range from 4,000 to 5,450 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 11 to 13 inches, mean annual temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 85 to 115 days."
