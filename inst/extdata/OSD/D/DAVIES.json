Gravel content ranges from 15 to 40 percent, cobbles range from 10 to 30 percent and stones range from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon.\nThe Oa horizon is muck or very cobbly muck.\nSome pedons have an A horizon, with hue of 2.5Y, value of 2 and chroma of 1.  Textures are similar to Bg horizon.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5, and chroma of 2. It is very cobbly sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 and chroma of 2. It is very cobbly or very gravelly sand. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral."
