  "OVERVIEW": "The Duguesclin series consists of moderately deep to a  duripan, well drained soils on plains, plateaus and mesas.  Duguesclin soils formed in loess.  Permeability is very slow.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
