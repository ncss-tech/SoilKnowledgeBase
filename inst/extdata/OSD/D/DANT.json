The soil is slightly or moderately affected by salinity which increases with depth.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown (10YR 5/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), brown (10YR 5/3), or dark brown (10YR 3/3, 4/3).  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or clay.\nThe B horizon is grayish brown (10YR 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2; 2.5Y 4/2), or brown (10YR 4/3, 5/3).  It is clay loam or clay; silicate clay content ranges from 28 to 35 percent.  Carbonate clay content is 5 to 15 percent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 35 percent.  The Bz and Bkz horizons are lacking in some pedons.\nThe C horizon is light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), pale brown (10YR 6/3), very pale brown (10YR 7/3, 7/4), light gray (10YR 7/2; 2.5Y 7/2), or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2; 2.5Y 6/2).
