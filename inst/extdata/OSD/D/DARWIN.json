  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the base of the cambic horizon ranges from 40 to 60 inches. The mollic epipedon ranges between 10 and 24 inches in thickness and includes the upper part of the Bg horizon in some pedons. The particle size control section averages between 45 and 60 percent clay. The series control section averages less than 5 percent sand.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or is neutral; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 2. It typically is silty clay, but some pedons are silty clay loam or clay. Clay content ranges from 35 to 60 percent. A silt loam overwash phase is recognized. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 0 to 2. It typically is silty clay, but some pedons contain subhorizons of clay. Also, some pedons have subhorizons in the lower part that are silty clay loam. Clay content averages between 45 and 55 percent and ranges from 38 to 65 percent in subhorizons. Many of the faces of the peds have shiny pressure faces and some pedons have slickensides. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline. Some pedons contain carbonates in the lower part.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 0 to 2. It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. Clay content ranges from 27 to 60 percent. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline and some pedons contain carbonates."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Saddlerock (T), Stillwater, and Waldo series. Saddlerock soils have one or more buried A horizons in the series control section, have a MAP of 10 inches, and formed in alluvium from basalt, andesite and tuff at elevations between 4400 to 5500 above MSL.  Stillwater soils do not have a cambic horizon and are more alkaline than slightly alkaline in the cambic horizon.  Waldo soils are more acid than slightly acid in the cambic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Darwin soils are on nearly level flood plains of large streams. Slope gradients commonly are less than 1 percent but range from 0 to 2 percent. Darwin soils formed in fine-textured alluvium. Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 48 inches, frost free days range from 140 to 200 days, and elevation ranges from 340 to 1250 feet above sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Beaucoup, Cairo, Dupo, Fults, Karnak, Petrolia, Titus, and Wabash soils. The poorly drained Beaucoup and Petrolia and somewhat poorly drained Tice soils contain less clay in the control section and are on similar or slightly higher parts of the flood plain. In addition, Petrolia soils do not have a mollic epipedon. The poorly drained Cairo soils have strongly contrasting particle-size class of clayey over sandy or sandy-skeletal and are in similar positions nearby. The poorly drained Karnak soils lack mollic epipedons and are on similar parts of flood plains. The somewhat poorly drained Dupo soils have strongly contrasting particle-size classes and are on higher parts of the flood plain nearby. Fults and Titus soils are nearby on similar or slightly higher parts of the flood plain. Wabash soils are nearby on similar or slightly lower parts of the flood plain."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained and very poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to very high. Permeability is slow or very slow. Flooding typically occurs occasionally or frequently on Darwin soils. Levees provide protection from frequent flooding in many areas of Darwin soils. The seasonal high water table is within 18 inches of the surface during the spring of normal years. Undrained areas have water at or above the surface for long or very long periods in most years."
