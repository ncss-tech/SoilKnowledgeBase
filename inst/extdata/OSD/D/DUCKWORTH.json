  "OVERVIEW": "The Duckworth series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes. These soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from serpentinite. Slope is 20 to 65 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (51.8 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 58 centimeters (22.8 inches).",
