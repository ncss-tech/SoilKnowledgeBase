  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Dunford series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from andesite and conglomerate.  These soils are on mountain slopes and have slopes of l5 to 60 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches.",
