    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Deza soils are on toeslopes and footslopes of stable landslides and have slopes of 5 to 25 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from Tertiary sandstone.  Elevations range from 8,000 to 9,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 24 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 39 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 110 days."

Narbona soils are loamy-skeletal, have sandy epipedons 20 to 40 inches thick, and occur on adjacent ridges of stable landslides and backslopes of escarpments. Sandark soils have a mollic epipedon and lack an argillic horizon."
