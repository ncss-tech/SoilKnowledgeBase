  "OVERVIEW": "The Deza series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone.  Deza soils are on toeslopes and footslopes of stable landslides and have rapid permeability. Slopes are 5 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
