    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dumont soils are on side slopes, plateaus, and broad ridgetops of mountains.  Elevations are 400 to 4,000 feet. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from metasedimentary or extrusive igneous rocks.   The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and warm, wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 35 to 60 inches but in areas of high winter rainfall of Curry County, Oregon, may range to 100 inches.  Snow falls during the winter. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is 25 to 32 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 200 days."
