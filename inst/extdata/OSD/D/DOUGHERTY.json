  "REVDATE": "04/2018",
  "STATES": "OK,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Dougherty series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sandy and loamy sediments on terraces of Pleistocene age. These soils are on stabilized dunes on reworked stream terraces in the Central Red Rolling Prairies (MLRA 80A) and Northern Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A). Slopes are dominantly 0 to 8 percent, but range to 20 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 860 mm (34 in).",
