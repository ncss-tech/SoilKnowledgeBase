  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of sandy horizons exceeds 80 inches.  The 10 to 40 inch control section contains 10 to 25 percent silt plus clay.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A horizon and upper C horizon and very strongly acid to neutral in the lower C horizon.  The soil is dry in some part of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 cumulative days in most years.  Small rounded pebbles range from none to few.\nThe A horizon has hues of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, values of 3 to 6, and chromas of 2 to 6.  Dark brown mottles range from none to few. Some pedons lack A horizons.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hues of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, values from 4 to 8, and chromas from 3 to 8.  The texture is mostly loamy fine sand, but some pedons have thin strata of fine sand, loamy sand, or sand.  Mottles range from none to few in shades of brown or yellow.  Thin discontinuous lamellae, below a depth of 40 inches, range from none to few.  Pockets or strata of clean sand with chroma of 1 or 2 occur below 40 inches in some pedons."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alaga, Alpin, Arenosa, Bigbee, Cainhoy, Catpoint, Duffern, Foxworth, Glentosh, Lakeland, Tonkawa and Wando series of the same family and Betis soils of a similar family.  Alaga, Alpin, Bigbee, and Lakeland soils are not dry for as long as 75 cumulative days in most years.  In addition, Alpin and Lakeland soils have less than 10 percent silt plus clay in the control section.  Bigbee and Foxworth soils have a seasonal water table.  Arenosa soils are dry in some part of the control section for more than 90 cumulative days in most years.  Cainhoy soils have lower horizons with chroma of 2 or less.   Catpoint and Glentosh soils have cooler mean annual temperatures that are less than 64 degrees F.  Also, Catpoint and Wando soils are on elevations under 50 feet above mean sea level (MSL).  In addition, Wando soils do not have lamellae.  Duffern and Tonkawa soils have 5 to 10 percent by volume silt plus clay in the control section.  Betis soils have argillic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Darden soils are on convex alluvial terraces and uplands.  They formed in sandy, unconsolidated Coastal Plain sediments.  Slopes are mainly 2 to 6 percent but range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual rainfall ranges from 40 to 55 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 68 degrees F., and the Thornthwaite annual P-E indices exceed 64."

Briley soils have sandy epipedons 20 to 40 inches thick.  Darco soils have sandy epipedons 40 to 72 inches thick, an argillic horizon, and occur on similar positions in the landscape.  Lilbert, Rosalie, and Tenaha soils have sandy epipedons 20 to 40 inches thick and argillic horizons.  Lilbert soils contain plinthite and occur in lower positions."
