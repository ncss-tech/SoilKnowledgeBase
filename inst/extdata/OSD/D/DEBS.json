  "OVERVIEW": "The Debs series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments on glacial lake plains, moraines, and glaciolacustrine landforms.\nPermeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 1 to 45 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",
