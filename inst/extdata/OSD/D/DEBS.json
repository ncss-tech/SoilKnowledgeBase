The Davidell soils have horizons with an electrical conductivity of 4-8 mmhos/cm in the lower third of the series control section.  Ivanell soils have sola terminated by a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Vanstel soils are dry in the soil moisture control section 40 to 50 percent of the time (cumulative) for 120 days following the summer solstice.\nVirkula soils do not have free carbonates in the series control section.   Winteridge soils have free carbonates at depths of 12 to 20 inches."
