  "OVERVIEW": "The Drakesflat series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt and tuff.  Drakesflat soils are on lava plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is 6 degrees C.",
