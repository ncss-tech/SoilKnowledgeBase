Killebrew soils have a massive E horizon, with a bulk density of more than 1.8 g/cm3, and a hard dry rupture resistance.  Mitchellbay soils have a densic contact at depths of 50 to 100 centimeters. Quatama soils are moderately well drained soils that formed in stratified glaciolacustrine deposits and the difference between mean summer and winter temperature of greater than 10 degrees C. Stockel soils have an ochric epipedon, redomorphic concentrations above 30 centimeters and a clay layer with 50 to 65 percent clay below 100 centimeters.  Sucia soils are 50 to 100 centimeters to a densic contact."

The soils formed in colluvium derived from mudstone, sandstone, and siltstone. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1780 to 2160 millimeters (70 to 85 inches). Mean January temperature is about 7 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 15 degree C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 15 degree C (50 to 59 degrees F). Frost free season is about 240 to 270 days."
