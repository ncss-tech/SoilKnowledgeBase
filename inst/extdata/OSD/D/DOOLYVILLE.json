  "OVERVIEW": "The Doolyville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in colluvium derived from mudstone, sandstone, and siltstone. Doolyville soils are on mountains and have slopes of 30 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1900 millimeters (75 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
