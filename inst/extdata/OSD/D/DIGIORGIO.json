Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline throughout.  Lime usually is disseminated in the lower part of the profiles, but may occur as filaments and threads in some pedons.  Organic matter is more than 1 percent to depths of more than 7 inches.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown, brown, dark grayish brown, dark brown, or dark yellowish brown (10YR 5/2, 5/3, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4).  It is typically sandy clay loam, but is loam, silt loam or clay loam in some pedons.  This horizon is not moist 3 months or more of the year (cumulative).\nThe C horizon is very pale brown, pale brown, yellowish brown, brown, grayish brown or dark brown (10YR 7/3, 6/3, 6/2, 5/4, 5/3, 5/2, 4/3).  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay loam.  Weak stratification occurs in some pedons."
