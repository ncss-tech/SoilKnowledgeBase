  "OVERVIEW": "The Dubay series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and glaciofluvial deposits.  These soils are on stream terraces and dissected alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
