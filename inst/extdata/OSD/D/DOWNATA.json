  "OVERVIEW": "The Downata series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in silty alluvium derived from mixed sources. Permeability is moderately slow. These soils are on flood plains and low stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Bigstone soils and Bloomington soils are saturated in the moisture control section for more than 20 days following the summer solstice in most years.  Halleck soils lack buried horizons.  Homefield soils have a calcic horizon and a 2C horizon at 40-60 inches.  Inkom soils average 18-27 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Lamoure soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a mollic epipedon with chroma of 1 or less.  Opie soils have a calcic horizon and a 2C horizon with 10-30 percent gravel.   Playmoor soils have salt accumulations (4 to 16 mmhos/cm), including gypsum, in the upper 20 inches.  Rauville soils are saturated in the soil moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice, and have chroma of 1 or less to a depth greater than 40 inches."
