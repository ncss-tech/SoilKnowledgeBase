  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to 80 inches or more.  Depth to limestone bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid except the surface layer is less acid where limed.  Fragments of chert range from 0 to 25 percent in the A horizon and 0 to 15 percent in the B horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Severely eroded areas also have hue of 5YR. Texture is silt loam or loam.  Severely eroded areas are also silty clay loam or silty clay.\nSome pedons have a transitional horizon between the A and the Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Some pedons have dark red (2.5YR 3/6) ped exteriors.  The upper part of the Bt also includes hue of 7.5YR. Mottles in shades of brown and yellow range from none to few in the upper part of the B horizon and from common to many in the lower part.  The texture is clay or silty clay.  The upper part of the Bt also includes silty clay loam or rarely clay loam.  In the particle size control section, clay content averages between 40 and 60 percent, silt content between 40 and 60 percent and sand content is less than 20 percent."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Christiana is the only other series in this same family. Series in similar families are the Collegedale, Dewey, Doniphan, Fredrick, Macedonia, and Waynesboro series.  Christiana soils formed in marine sediments that do not contain any chert and the Bt horizon is centered on 10R hue.  Collegedale, Dewey, and Waynesboro soils are thermic.  Doniphan, Fredrick, and Macedonia soils have mixed mineralogy."

These soils formed residuum of dolomitic limestone.   Mean annual temperature is 56.6 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 44.4 inches near the type location."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Greendale, Landisburg, Lindside, Sequoia, and Shouns series.  Greendale soils, which are along intermittent drainageways, lack argillic horizons.  Landisburg soils, which are on foot slopes, have fragipans.  Lindside soils are on the bottomlands, have gray mottles, and lack argillic horizons.  Sequoia soils have a paralithic contact within 40 inches.  Shouns soils are on foot slopes and benches and are fine-loamy."
