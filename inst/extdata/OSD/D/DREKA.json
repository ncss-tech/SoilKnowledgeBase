This soil floods frequently, typically 2 to 5 times during most years for long or very long durations. A perched water table fluctuates within a depth of about 0.5 to 2.5 feet during the winter and spring months for a cumulative annual duration of 1 to 3 months."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soil are used for woodland and pasture. Native vegetation is mainly hardwood such as water oak, green ash, hackberry, willow oak, sweet gum and cypress. Waxleaf myrtle, bacharis and blackberrys are common in cleared areas. Herbaceous vegetation includes beak panicum, purpletop, long tom, longleaf uniola, Virginia wildrye, low panicums, and palmetto. Pastures are mainly common bermudagrass and/or bahiagrass interspersed with dallisgrass."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were previously included with the Nahatche series.  The Dreka series classification was changed from an Aeric Fluvaquent to a Fluvaquentic Epiaquept in 2002 based on structure described in the Bg horizons and the presence of a clayey discontinuity that acts as an aquitard.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 10 inches. (A horizon)\nCambic horizon - The zone from 10 to 80 inches. (Bg and 2Bgb horizons)\nAquic conditions - saturation, reduction and redoximorphic features, including a depleted matrix in all layers below 10 inches. (Bg and 2Bgb horizon)\nIrregular organic carbon distribution - Irregular distribution of organic matter with depth between 10 and 50 inches. (Bg horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity - at 49 inches (top of the 2Bgb1 horizon)\nEpisaturation - saturation in the layers above 49 inches during periods when the layer below 49 inches is not saturated (Bg horizons)\nSoil Interpretation Record Number: TX1243"
