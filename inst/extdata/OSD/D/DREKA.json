    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the only series in this family. The Belden, Commerce, Mathiston, Nahatche, Pophers, Socagee, and Valdez series are in closely related families. Belden, Commerce, and Valdez soils have mixed mineralogy.  In addition, Valdez soils do not have a cambic horizon. Mathiston and Pophers and Socagee soils have an acid reaction class. Nahatche soils have a fine-loamy control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dreka soils are on nearly level flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. They formed in loamy and clayey alluvium of local streams. Mean annual precipitation ranges' from 44 to 48 inches. Mean annual temperature range from 65 to 67 degrees Fahrenheit. Frost free days ranges from 235 to 250. Elevation ranges from 150 to 390 feet above sea level. The Thornthwaite P.E.\nindex ranges from 72 to 84."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the closely related Mathiston soils and the Estes, Iulus, Laneville, and Owentown soils. All of these soils are on similar nearly level flood plains. Mathiston soils have an acid reaction class. Estes soils are clayey throughout. Iulus and Owentown soils have a coarse-loamy control section and typically are on slightly higher and narrower flood plains in the watershed. Laneville soils are moderately well drained and do not have aquic conditions within a depth of 20 inches."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Dreka soils are somewhat poorly drained. Permeability is moderately slow. Runoff is negligible. This soil floods frequently, typically 2 to 5 times during most years for long or very long durations. A perched water table fluctuates within a depth of about 0.5 to 2.5 feet during the winter and spring months for a cumulative annual duration of 1 to 3 months."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soil are used for woodland and pasture. Native vegetation is mainly hardwood such as water oak, green ash, hackberry, willow oak, sweet gum and cypress. Waxleaf myrtle, bacharis and blackberrys are common in cleared areas. Herbaceous vegetation includes beak panicum, purpletop, long tom, longleaf uniola, Virginia wildrye, low panicums, and palmetto. Pastures are mainly common bermudagrass and/or bahiagrass interspersed with dallisgrass."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were previously included with the Nahatche series.  The Dreka series classification was changed from an Aeric Fluvaquent to a Fluvaquentic Epiaquept in 2002 based on structure described in the Bg horizons and the presence of a clayey discontinuity that acts as an aquitard.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 10 inches. (A horizon)\nCambic horizon - The zone from 10 to 80 inches. (Bg and 2Bgb horizons)\nAquic conditions - saturation, reduction and redoximorphic features, including a depleted matrix in all layers below 10 inches. (Bg and 2Bgb horizon)\nIrregular organic carbon distribution - Irregular distribution of organic matter with depth between 10 and 50 inches. (Bg horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity - at 49 inches (top of the 2Bgb1 horizon)\nEpisaturation - saturation in the layers above 49 inches during periods when the layer below 49 inches is not saturated (Bg horizons)\nSoil Interpretation Record Number: TX1243\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
