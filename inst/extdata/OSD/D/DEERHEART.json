  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Deerheart soils are on glacial lake plains and depressions on outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in silty and loamy glaciolacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 7.2 degrees C (40 to 45 degrees F)."

The somewhat poorly drained Bowers and the moderately well drained or well drained Nunica soils are in the same drainage sequence. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Wakeley and the somewhat poorly drained Allendale soils have sandier upper sola and are on similar or slightly higher landscape positions. The moderately well drained Croswell and Perecheney soils are on higher landscape positions."

The depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between September and June in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. Permeability is slow."
