  "REVDATE": "08/2012",
  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Deerheart series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils that formed in silty and loamy glaciolacustrine deposits on glacial lake plains and depressions on outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",
