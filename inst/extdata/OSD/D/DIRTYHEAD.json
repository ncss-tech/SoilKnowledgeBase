  "REVDATE": "02/2006",
  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Dirtyhead series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived dominantly from calcareous siltstone, shale, and sandstone. They are on terraces, hillsides and mountainsides. Permeability is moderate. Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
