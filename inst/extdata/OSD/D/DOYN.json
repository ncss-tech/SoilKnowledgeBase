  "OVERVIEW": "The Doyn series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from basalt, rhyolite and andesite.  They are on hills and tablelands.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are dry for one-half to three-fourths of the time when the soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 4 to 10 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 10 to 35 percent rock fragments and 18 to 30 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is sandy clay loam, loam or clay loam.  The upper part contains 10 to 50 percent rock fragments and is neutral or slightly alkaline.  The lower part is slightly or moderately alkaline and contains 5 to 35 percent rock fragments."

Areas mapped as Doyn in Lake County are now mapped as Fitzwater soils.  The type location was moved in 1996, no change in classification\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
