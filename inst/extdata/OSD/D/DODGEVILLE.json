  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 40 inches, which corresponds to the depth to the bedrock. The solum, other than the Ap, which is neutral or slightly acid, is slightly acid or medium acid, but horizons that are strongly acid are within the range. In some places the bedrock is solid, but in other places, it has fissures filled with clay that extend downward for several feet. Slopes over 20 percent generally are underlain by fragmental material rather than solid bedrock.\nThe Ap and A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe BA horizon has 10YR hue, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has 10YR hue, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. Clay content averages between 25 and 35 percent.\nThe 2Bt horizon has 7.5YR, 5YR, and 2.5YR hue; value and chroma is 3 through 5. It is silty clay or clay. Clay content averages between 55 and 75 percent. Coarse fragments, mainly chert, range from 2 to 10 percent and up to 5 percent of the fragments are greater than 3 inches in size."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the only series in this family. Other series in closely related families are Ashdale, Dubuque, Edmund, Hitt, Mendota, NewGlarus, Ogle, Plano, Saybrook, and Tama. Ashdale, Dubuque, Hitt, Mendota, Ogle, Plano, Saybrook and Tama soils do not have a strongly contrasting particle-size class within a depth of 40 inches. In addition, Dubuque soils do not have a mollic epipedon and Hitt soils are fine-loamy. Edmund soils are clayey and lithic. New Glarus soils are fine-silty over clayey but do not have a mollic epipedon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dodgeville soils are on ridgetops and on side slopes in undulating to rolling landscapes underlain by dolomite or limestone. Slope gradients range from 0 to 30 percent. The soils formed in 15 to 30 inches of loess and in the underlying clay residuum (paleosol) weathered from dolomite or limestone. The residuum ranges from 10 to 20 inches in thickness. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 35 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 53 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the well drained Ashdale, Dubuque, Edmund, Hitt, NewGlarus, Rockton, Sogn, and Whalan soils. Ashdale soils are on ridgetops where the bedrock is deeper. Dubuque soils are in areas where the clay residuum is less than 6 inches thick. Edmund and Sogn soil are nearby in areas where the limestone is at a depth of less than 20 inches. In addition, Sogn soils are in dry sites and do not have argillic horizons. Hitt and Rockton soils are both fine-loamy and similar. In addition, Hitt soils have from 10 to 25 inches of loess overlying the drift and residuum. NewGlarus and Dodgeville soils form a biosequence. NewGlarus soils formed under forest vegetation. Whalan soils are in nearby glaciated area that is dominated by forest vegetation."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 13 inches (Ap and A horizons); argillic horizon - zone from 16 to 35 inches (Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons).\nAs the Dodgeville series is defined in this description, thickness of loess is permitted to range from 15 to 30 inches and the residuum from 10 to 20 inches in any combination. Thus in some pedons, the B horizon is formed mostly in loess, in others, mostly in residuum. This permits a wide range in properties in the control section. Fine-silty over clayey and clayey particle-size classes can be recognized in the setting of these soils but fine-silty over clayey will be the concept. Additional study is needed to determine if more narrowly defining the thickness of loess and residuum would be appropriate and thus separate two series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
