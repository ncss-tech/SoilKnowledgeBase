Depth to calcareous material and depth to sandy-skeletal material ranges from 0 to 10 inches.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 75 percent and are dominantly pebbles but includes cobble. In the particle size control section, clay is less than 10 percent, silt ranges from 0 to 20 percent with sand from 70 to 95 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue from 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bk or C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 1 through 4.  Reaction ranges from mildly to moderately alkaline.  Texture is very gravelly sand or very gravelly or gravelly loamy coarse sand, or extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand."

Saguache soils are noncalcareous, but very strongly alkaline with exchangeable sodium percentage in excess of 15 percent in the upper part of the control section.  Kadletz soils have silica pendants on rock fragments at 12 inches and deeper."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dunul soils are on alluvial fans, hills, ridgetops or relict streambeds and terrace margins. Slopes range from 0 to about 30 percent.  The soil formed in thick calcareous very gravelly coarse textured alluvial fan sediments capped by moderately coarse-textured alluvium to a depth of 4 to 11 inches.  The average annual precipitation is 6 to 11 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F, and mean summer temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from 6,200 to 7,900 feet.  The frost-free period is 75 to 105 days."

Quamon soils have a water table that moistens the lower part of the moisture control section for more than one-half of the time that the soil is 41 degrees F. or above. Monte soils have a fine-loamy control section."
