  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Daggerhill series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in deep sandy eolian sediments on barrier islands.  These gently to strongly sloping soils are on undulating to strongly rolling foredunes and stabilized back-island dune fields.    Slope ranges from 2 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in) mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).",
