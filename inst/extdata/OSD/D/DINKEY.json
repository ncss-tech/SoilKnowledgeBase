  "OVERVIEW": "The Dinkey series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in stratified sandy alluvium and organic materials on high stream terraces.  Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The characteristic red color of the surface muck is due to past fires and oxidation.  Ash in the surface layer also accounts for the effervescence and higher pH.\nThe organic horizons have hue of 10R to 5YR, or are neutral, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 6. Reaction of the organic horizons is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  They are sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand with thin strata of muck or mucky analogues of textures listed above. Reaction of the C horizons is neutral or slightly alkaline."
