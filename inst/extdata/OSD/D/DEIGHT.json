  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches thick.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 11 to 20 inches.  Depth to continuous accumulations of calcium carbonate ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  The moisture control section is dry more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. It is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days during the 90 day period following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3. Textures are very fine sandy loam or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe Bk  horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 10 to 20 percent.  Some pedons have a Btk horizon with basic properties similar to the Bk horizon.\nThe C horizon, when present, has value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4."

They formed in alluvium derived dominantly from fine-grained effervescent sandstone.   Slopes are 0 to 6 percent. Elevations are 4300 to 5700 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 15 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 130 days."
