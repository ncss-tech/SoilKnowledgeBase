  "OVERVIEW": "The Devnot series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from basalt, sandstone or conglomerate with a component of loess.  Devnot soils are on foothills.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
