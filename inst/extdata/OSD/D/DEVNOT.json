The soils formed in residuum from basalt with some sandstone and conglomerate a component of loess.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 to 50 degrees F.  The climate has cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The frost-free season is about 80 to 140 days."
