  "OVERVIEW": "The Dinsdale series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in 50 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) of loess and the underlying glacial till. Dinsdale soils are on interfluves, ridges and side slopes on dissected till plains. Slopes range from 0 to 14 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 910 millimeters (36 inches).",
