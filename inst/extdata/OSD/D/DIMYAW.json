  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 degrees to 47 degrees F.  The soils have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, dry value of 5 or 7, moist value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  All horizons range from clay loam to silty clay with clay content ranging from 36 to 50 percent.  Estimated cation exchange capacity ranges from 50 to 60 millequivalents per 100 grams of clay.  Soft sedimentary beds underlie the C1ca horizon in some pedons but these beds do not restrict root distribution."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Epsie, Kuro, Lambert, Lisam, Midway, and Wayden series.  Epsie and Lisam soils have 50 to 60 percent clay and are usually dry.  Kuro soils have paralithic contact with red shale at depths of about 15 inches and have hues ranging from 5YR through 10R.  Lambert soils have less than 35 percent clay and have from 5 to 10 Percent fine and coarser sands.  Midway soils are usually dry and have a mesic temperature regime.  Wayden soils have paralithic contact at a depth of less than 20 inches."

Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 40 degrees to 45 degrees F., mean January temperature is 10 degrees to 25 degrees F., and mean July temperature is 66 degrees to 72 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 135 days."
