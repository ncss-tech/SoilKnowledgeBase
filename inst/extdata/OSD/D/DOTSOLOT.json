  "OVERVIEW": "The Dotsolot series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Dotsolot soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
