  "OVERVIEW": "The Duff series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Duff soils are on concave mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

Pavohroo soils have a cambic horizon and limestone rock fragments.  Rhone soils have a C horizon that is dominantly very channery sandy clay loam within a depth of 50 to 100 cm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Duff soils are on concave, north aspects of mountain side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from intrusive and extrusive volcanic rock.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,830 to 2,810 meters.  The climate is cold semiarid with cold, moist winters and short, warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 360 to 460 mm, mainly as snow; precipitation on high peaks and ridges may be considerably higher, but is less effective due to high wind and runoff; mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 60 to 80 days."
