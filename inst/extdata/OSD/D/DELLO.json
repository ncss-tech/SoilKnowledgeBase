  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 60 to 70 degrees F.  The soil between the depth of 10 to 50 inches is saturated for at least a few days.  Some pedons are saline-sodic throughout.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, or 6/4; 2.5Y 6/2, 5/2, 4/2; 5Y 5/2, and moist color of 10YR 4/4, 4/3, 4/2; 2.5Y 4/2; 5Y 4/2.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  The texture is sand, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, sandy loam or fine sand.  Most pedons have distinct or prominent mottles or a clay loam overwash texture.\nThe Cg horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6, 7/2, 7/3, 8/2 or 8/3; 5Y 6/1; 2.5Y 8/2, 7/2, 6/2 and moist color of 10YR 5/2, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4 or 7/2; 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2, 7/2.  Mottles are faint, distinct or prominent.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  The textural control section between the depth of 10 to 40 inches is sand, loamy sand, fine sand or loamy fine sand.  Fine stratification is present, but individual strata are evidenced primarily by minor color differences.  In some pedons the lower C horizon (below 40 inches) have stratified silty clay to clay loam lenses."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dello soils are on nearly level flood plains, slough remnants and small depressions in the San Joaquin valley and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The soil formed in material weathered from granitic rock sources.  Elevations are from 10 feet below sea level to about 500 feet.  The climate is subhumid with dry summers and cool moist winters.  Dense ground fog often occurs in the winter months.  Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 15 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 45 degrees F.; the mean July temperature ranges from 75 to 81 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 250 to 270 days."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {

In some areas a water table is more than 6 feet from the surface because of flood control structures and/or installed drains.  The frequency of flooding is rare or occasional."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The original series description range in characteristics include pedons that would be classified as Typic Fluvaquents, sandy, mixed, thermic.  Previous updating excluded those pedons with silty lenses within the textural control section and restricted them to a depth below 40 inches.  The Dello mapped in western Riverside soil survey is somewhat poorly drained and has warmer winter temperatures.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon- the zone from 0 to 6 inches (Ag)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
