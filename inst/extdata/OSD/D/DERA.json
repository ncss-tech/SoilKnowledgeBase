  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dera soils occur on long alluvial fans, fan terraces, fan skirts, colluvial slopes and lake terraces with gradients of 0 to 15 percent.  They formed in alluvium, colluvium and lake sediments primarily from igneous and sedimentary rock, including limestone, dolomite and small amounts of quartzite.  These soils occur at elevations of 4,000 to 6,500 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 5 to 10 inches.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 55 degrees F, with mean summer temperatures ranging from 69 to 72 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 100 to 125 days in Utah and to 180 days in Arizona."

(Bk horizon)\nIn Utah this series is correlated with Desert range sites.\nClassification changed from Typic Calciorthids to Typic Haplocalcids in 8/94, due to an amendment to Soil Taxonomy.\nLab data is available for the similar soils in these pedon numbers: 66UT027005, 66UT027008, 68UT027005. Further investigation is needed on the sodium content of this series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
