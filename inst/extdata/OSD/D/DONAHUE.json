  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock and thickness of solum range from 20 to 40 inches. Thickness of the upper solum with more than 20 percent sand ranges from 12 to 24 inches. Sandstone gravel, cobbles and channers range from 0 to 30 percent in the upper solum and limestone channers and flagstone range from 0 to 15 percent of the lower solum. Reaction ranges from strongly to very strongly acid in the upper solum and from strongly acid to mildly alkaline in the lower horizons.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is sandy loam or loam.\nThe BE or E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam. The 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8. Lithochromic mottles in shades of yellow, brown, or red are common. Texture is silty clay or clay.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 6. Lithochromic mottles in shades of gray, brown, yellow or red are common. Texture is silty clay or clay. A thin Cr horizon overlying limestone bedrock is present in some horizons\nThe R horizon is unweathered limestone interbedded with thin bands of calcareous shale."

Beasley, Bledsoe, Bonnell, Brashear, Bucklick, Estate, Heitt, Kewaunee, Lowell, Markland and Vandalia soils are greater than 40 inches to lithic or paralithic contact. Caneyville, Eden, Faywood, Fredonia and Solway soils have less than 20 percent sand in the upper part of the solum and do not have a lithologic discontinuity within a depth of 12 to 24 inches. Cosperville, Heverlo and Milton soils formed in glacial till or poorly sorted outwash. Enott soils formed in residuum weathered from intermediate mafic metamorphic or igneous rock. Haggatt soils are capped with up to 20 inches of loess."

These soils formed in 12 to 24 inches of colluvium weathered mostly from sandstone over residuum from limestone interbedded with calcareous shales. Mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 52 inches."
