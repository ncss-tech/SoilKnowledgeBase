  "OVERVIEW": "The Delvar series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium mainly from granitic and meta-sedimentary rocks. Delvar soils are on stream terraces. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.",

This soil was naturally slightly saline-sodic and has been modified by the addition of farm soil amendments, large amounts of irrigation water, and large amounts of organic matter.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon -- the zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 28 inches. (Ap1, Ap2, Bt and Btk1 horizons)\nArgillic horizon -- the zone from 12 to 42 inches (Bt, Btk1, Btk2, Btk3 horizons)\nSoft powdery carbonates --  the zone from 19 to 28 inches (Btk1)\nWhen dry, the Bt horizon has cracks 2-7 mm wide."
