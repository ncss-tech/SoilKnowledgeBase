    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Delvar soils are on stream terraces with slopes of 2 to 30 percent. They formed in mixed alluvium derived mainly from granitic and meta-sedimentary rocks.  Elevations range from 400 to 2000 feet. The climate is semi-arid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 12 inches. The mean annual temperature is 62 to 65 degrees F. The frost-free season is 250 to 300 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Some areas have been acidified by the use of sulfur sulfuric acid and other soil amendments. This soil was naturally slightly saline-sodic and has been modified by the addition of farm soil amendments, large amounts of irrigation water, and large amounts of organic matter.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon -- the zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 28 inches. (Ap1, Ap2, Bt and Btk1 horizons)\nArgillic horizon -- the zone from 12 to 42 inches (Bt, Btk1, Btk2, Btk3 horizons)\nSoft powdery carbonates --  the zone from 19 to 28 inches (Btk1)\nWhen dry, the Bt horizon has cracks 2-7 mm wide.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
