  "OVERVIEW": "The Devilfence series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum derived from hard brown shale or argillite bedrock.  These soils are on escarpments, ridges and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
