    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Total thickness of the A and E horizons range from 40 to 74 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline throughout, generally becoming less acid with depth.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  Texture is sand or fine sand, but includes loamy sand, mucky loamy fine sand, or mucky fine sand.  Organic matter content ranges from about 2 to 18 percent.  In depressional areas, a thin Oa surface layer of muck may be present.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 7.  Texture is sand or fine sand.  Very dark gray or black vertical streaks less than 1 inch wide range from none to common.\nThe Btg horizon has hue from 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, gray, or yellow range from none to common.\nThe BCg horizon, where present, has colors similar to the Btg horizon.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has colors similar to the Btg horizon.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, fine sand, or sand.  Layers of shells, shell fragments, or limestone are range from none to common."

Anclote, Pompano, and Valkaria soils are sandy throughout. In addition, Valkaria soils are poorly drained. Chobee and Manatee soils have surface and subsurface layers less than 20 inches in thickness. The poorly drained Felda and Riviera soils are arenic and do not have a mollic epipedon. Floridana and Hicoria are arenic.  In addition, Hicoria soils do not have a mollic epipedon.  Holopaw and Popash soils do not have a mollic epipedon."
