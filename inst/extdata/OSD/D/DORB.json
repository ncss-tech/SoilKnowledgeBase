  "OVERVIEW": "The Dorb series consists of deep, well drained soils on plateaus, terrace escarpments and canyonsides.  They formed in volcanic ash overlying basalt bedrock.  Slope ranges from 5 to 65 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 30 inches.",
