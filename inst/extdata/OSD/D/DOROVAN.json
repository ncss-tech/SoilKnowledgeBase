  "OVERVIEW": "The Dorovan series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, moderately permeable soils on densely forested flood plains, hardwood swamps, and depressions in the Atlantic Coast Flatwoods (153A), Eastern Gulf Coast Flatwoods (152A), and Southern Coastal Plain Major (133A) Land Resource Areas.  They formed in highly decomposed acid-organic materials.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 67 degrees F., and the annual precipitation is about 57 inches.  Slopes are less than 1 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The organic material ranges from 51 to more than 80 inches thick.  Reaction is extremely acid to very strongly acid in the organic layers and very strongly acid or strongly acid in the mineral layers.\nThe Oi layer, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  It contains more than 40 percent fiber rubbed.\nThe Oe layer, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  It contains 20 to 40 percent fiber rubbed.\nThe Oa layers have hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 3; or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3. They contain 10 to 40 percent fiber unrubbed, less than 1/6 of the volume when rubbed.  Fibers remaining after rubbing are dominantly woody.  A few logs and large fragments of wood are typically in the lower part of the organic layers.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 0 to 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 5.  Texture is sand, coarse sand, fine sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, clay or their mucky analogues."
