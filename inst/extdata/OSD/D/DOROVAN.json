  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The organic material ranges from 51 to more than 80 inches thick.  Reaction is extremely acid to very strongly acid in the organic layers and very strongly acid or strongly acid in the mineral layers.\nThe Oi layer, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  It contains more than 40 percent fiber rubbed.\nThe Oe layer, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  It contains 20 to 40 percent fiber rubbed.\nThe Oa layers have hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 3; or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3. They contain 10 to 40 percent fiber unrubbed, less than 1/6 of the volume when rubbed.  Fibers remaining after rubbing are dominantly woody.  A few logs and large fragments of wood are typically in the lower part of the organic layers.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 0 to 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 5.  Texture is sand, coarse sand, fine sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, clay or their mucky analogues."

Ebro soils have more than 75 percent silt plus clay in the mineral fraction.  Pungo soils have parts of the control section that are less decomposed than Dorovan soils."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dorovan soils are on the flood plains, hardwood swamps, and depressions.  They formed in highly decomposed acid-organic materials.  The climate is humid subtropical.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 67 degrees F., and the annual precipitation is about 57 inches."

The poorly drained Atmore, somewhat poorly drained Basin and Lenoir and the moderately well drained Harleston soils are on adjacent higher positions and are mineral throughout. Croatan, Pamlico and Ponzer soils have mineral layers at a depth of less than 51 inches. Johnston soils are in similar positions but are mineral throughout."
