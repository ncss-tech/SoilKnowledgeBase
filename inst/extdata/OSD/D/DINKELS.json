  "OVERVIEW": "The Dinkels series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium from granitic rock mixed with loess, volcanic ash and pumice. Dinkels soils are on side slopes of plateaus and mountain side slopes. Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 105 consecutive days following summer solstice. The mollic epipedon is 14 to 20 inches thick. Base saturation by sum of base is 75 to 100 percent throughout. The particle-size control section averages 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments, and contains 30 to 60 percent glass and glass aggregate. Field estimated clay content is 4 to 10 percent. Acid oxalate extractable aluminum plue one-half the iron is 0.15 to 0.40 percent. The 15 bar water retention on air dried samples is 5 to 10 percent. Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Soil reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. It is ashy loam, ashy sandy loam, or ashy fine sandy loam in the upper part and ashy coarse sandy loam, ashy sandy loam, or ashy fine sandy loam in the lower part.\nThe C horizon, when present, has value of 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is gravelly coarse sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly coarse sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam, or very cobbly coarse sandy loam."
