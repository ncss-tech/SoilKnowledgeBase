  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil between the depths of 8 and 15 inches is moist in all parts from late November until March.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 59 to 64 degrees F.  Organic matter is less than 1 percent.  Some pedons are saline, with conductivity of the saturation extract ranging up to 16mmhos/cm.\nThe A horizon is fine sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam or light sandy clay loam.  It is brown pale brown, or light yellowish brown (10YR 5/3, 6/3, 6/4).  Disseminated carbonates occur throughout the A horizon in some pedons or start in the lower part in other pedons.  Coarse fragments in the form of nodules are scattered over the surface in some pedons and make up 0 to 5 percent of the horizon by volume.\nThe Bk and C horizons are light yellowish brown, pale brown, or very pale brown (10YR 6/4, 6/3 7/3, 7/4), or light brownish gray, light gray, or white (2.5Y 6/2, 7/2, 8/2).  It is clay loam or sandy clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay in the 10- to 40-inch section.  This horizon is heavy sandy loam in the lower part in some pedons.  Coarse fragments in the form of extremely hard nodules make up 35 to 80 percent by volume of the 10- to 40-inch control section.  The sum of the carbonates is more than 65 percent and calcium carbonate is more than 40 percent by weight.  Nodules are to about 0 to 10 percent below depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Some pedons have an unrelated faintly mottled stratified horizon at depths greater than 60 inches."

The climate is aridic with hot, dry summers and mild, somewhat moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 3 to 8  inches, some as snow.  Average January temperature is 44 to 45 degrees F.; average July temperature is 80 to 88 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 200 to 300 days.  The Thornthwaite PE index is less than 12."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Series reclassified on September, 1994.  Competing series not reviewed at that time.  Partially revised, 6/96.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL pedon S74CA-029-006.\nThis series includes the central concept of the inactivated Sunrise series which had the same type location, characterization pedon and OSD.  The concept of DeStazo is that the durinodes are non-slaking fragments > 2mm and should be considered to act as rock fragments. The Sunrise series did not consider the durinodes as RF and consequently the soil was classified as fine-loamy instead of loamy-skeletal.\nRunoff classes based on Ksat and slope as described in \"Terminology Used in Soil Survey Data Entry or Manuscript Editing of:\" 9-23-94 MAV.  Runoff changed from slow to medium to negligible to medium.\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 11 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 11 to 52 inches (Bk1, Bk2 and Bk3 horizons)\nParticle size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (Bk1, Bk2 and part of the Bk3 horizons)\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015. The last revision to the series was 2/1997. ET\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
