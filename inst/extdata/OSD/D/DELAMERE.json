    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in glaciolacustrine or glaciofluvial composed mostly of fine and very fine sands. The climate is cool subhumid.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 44 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 15 to 22 inches."

Embden, Gardena, Hecla and Mantador soils are on higher landscape positions.  These soils do not have redoximorphic features in the lower part of the mollic epipedon.  In addition, Gardena soils are coarse-silty, Hecla soils are sandy, and Mantador soils have carbonates at depths of less than 16 inches.  Garborg soils occupy similar positions on the landscape as Delamere soils. They are sandy.  Glyndon and Wyndmere soils are on slightly higher positions on the landscape than the Delamere soils.  They have calcic horizons within depths of 16 inches."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 18 inches (Ap and Bw horizons); calcic horizon - the zone from 18 to 27 inches; aquic suborder criteria - chroma of 1 in the lower part of the mollic epipedon and distinct redoximorphic concentrations (Bw horizon).\nSoils previously correlated as a somewhat poorly drained phase of the Tiffany series are included in the Delamere series.  This pedon meets hydric indicator TF7, but these soils are considered nonhydric.  The wet soil moisture status is typically too deep (greater than 1.5 feet).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
