The soils usually are moist Bt are dry at depths between 4 and 12 inches about 90 to 120 consecutive days in the four-month period following the summer solstice. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 35 inches thick. Rock fragments in the A horizon range from 15 to 50 percent with 5 to 15 percent being cobbles and stones. Rock fragments in the 10- to 40-inch control section range from 35 to 75 percent with 0 to 25 percent being cobbles and stones. Rock fragments in the 10- to 40-inch control section range from 35 to 75 percent with 0 to 25 percent being cobbles and stones. The control section is loam or clay loam and averages 18 to 30 percent clay. The soils are neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 moist and 1 or 2 dry.\nThe B horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry."

Mean January temperature is 27 degrees to 29 degrees F., the mean July temperature is 64 degrees to 69 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 46 degrees to 49 degrees F.
