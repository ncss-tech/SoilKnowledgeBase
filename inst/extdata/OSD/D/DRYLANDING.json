Clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 6 to 18 percent as a weighted average. Fine sand or coarser is greater than 15 percent.  Volume of rock fragments in the particle-size control section range from 35 to 85 percent as a weighted average.  Volume of channers ranges from 25 to 65 percent and volume of flagstones ranges from 10 to 20 percent throughout.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have O horizons with hue of 2.5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. The material consists mostly of slightly to moderately decomposed leaves and twigs.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is channery or very channery loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture is the channery, very channery or extremely channery analogs of silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe 2R horizon is mudstone bedrock."
