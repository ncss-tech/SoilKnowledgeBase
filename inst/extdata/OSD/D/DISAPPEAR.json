Total coarse fragments in the solum ranges from 0 to 20 percent, 0 to 12 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles. Total coarse fragments in the upper part of the substratum ranges from 0 to 15 percent gravel. Total coarse fragments in the lower part of the substratum ranges from 15 to 80 percent, 10 to 75 percent gravel and 5 to 25 percent cobbles. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the solum and moderately acid or slightly acid in the substratum. Depth to highest water table is about 1 to 1/2 feet from mid April to mid June. Depth to water table is about 1 to 6 feet throughout rest the year.\nThe O horizons have textures of peat, mucky peat, or muck.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. The texture is gravelly sandy loam, silt loam, or loam.\nThe 2BC horizon (where present) has chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, and chroma of 1 to 3. The texture is sandy loam, silt loam, or loamy fine sand.\nThe stratified 3C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, and chroma of 1 to 3."
