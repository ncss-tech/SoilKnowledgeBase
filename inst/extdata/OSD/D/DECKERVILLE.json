  "OVERVIEW": "The Deckerville series consists of deep poorly drained soils formed in recent alluvium and glacial outwash in swales, slight depressions, and along waterways on glacial terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 70 to 100 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Coarse fragments average from 5 to 35 percent in the upper part of the particle size control section and from 35 to 70 percent in the lower part.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  it is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe AC horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Texture is gravelly loam, loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or gravelly clay loam.  It is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 1 to 4 moist and dry and is mottled.  Texture is very gravelly loamy coarse sand, extremely gravelly coarse sand or very gravelly coarse sand.  it is slightly acid or moderately acid."

Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from sea level to 1,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and cool, relatively dry summers. The average annual precipitation is 70 to 100 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 38 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 165 to 195 days."

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an umbric epipedon from the surface to 26 inches and an abrupt change to sandy-skeletal material at 26 inches.  The profile is assumed to have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth.  This draft reflects an update in format only of a 1955 description.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
