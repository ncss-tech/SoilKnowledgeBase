  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to a petrocalcic horizon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The texture is loam or clay loam.  Coarse fragments consist of a few to 20 percent by volume of angular fragments of calcium carbonate and chert gravel.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 10 to 40 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7 and chroma 2 or 3.  When the color values are less than 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist the A horizon is 4 to 6 inches thick.\nThe Bkm horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe upper part of the Ck horizon is laminar or massive. The Ck horizon ranges from weakly consolidated to strongly cemented calcium carbonate.  It is gravelly in some pedons."

Blakeney, Conger, Delnorte, and Upton soils have mean annual soil temperature less than 72 degrees F. Cuevitas soils are fine sandy loam or loam throughout.  Delnorte, Jimenez, and Olmos soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in their control sections. Mavco soils lack petrocalcic horizons.  Valco soils, as well as Olmos soils, have mollic epipedons.  Zapata soils are less that 10 inches deep."

The mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 22 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 70 to 74 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 260 to 290 days and elevation ranges from 550 to 1,000 feet.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 20 to 28."
