  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Decorock series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed igneous and shale alluvium over residuum derived from Mancos Shale.  Decorock soils are on paleoterraces.  Slopes range from 20 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",

(Bty horizon)\nParalithic contact:  The contact with soft Mancos Shale at 58 inches.  (2Cr horizon)\nThis soil does not have a calcic horizon because no horizon has 5 percent or more visible carbonates, and no horizon has a calcium carbonate equivalent that is 5 percent or more higher than that of an underlying horizon."
