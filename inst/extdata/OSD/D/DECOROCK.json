(Bty horizon)\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 7 inches.  (A and BA horizons)\nArgillic horizon:  The zone from 26 to 58 inches.  (Bty horizon)\nGypsic horizon:  The zone from 15 to 30 inches.  (Bty horizon)\nParalithic contact:  The contact with soft Mancos Shale at 58 inches.  (2Cr horizon)\nThis soil does not have a calcic horizon because no horizon has 5 percent or more visible carbonates, and no horizon has a calcium carbonate equivalent that is 5 percent or more higher than that of an underlying horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  A HACH kit was used to determine gypsum concentrations. A portable EC meter was used for electrical conductivity. Calcium carbonate equivalence was determined using a field volume calcimeter.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
