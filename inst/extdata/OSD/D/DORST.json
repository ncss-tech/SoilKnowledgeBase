  "OVERVIEW": "The Dorst series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in colluvium, slope alluvium, and residuum derived from granitic rocks. Dorst soils are on structural benches and mountain slopes in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 980 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
