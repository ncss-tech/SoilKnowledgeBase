    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to accumulations of salts ranges from 5 to 15 inches and the SAR ranges from 13 to 25.  The soils can contain up to 5 percent by volume of pebbles and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nSome pedons have an A horizon 2 inches thick or less.\nThe E horizon has value of 3 or 4, and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is silt loam, but is loam in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 3, and 3 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have moist value of 4 in the lower part.  It is clay, clay loam, or silty clay averaging between 35 and 60 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline in the upper part and slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline in the lower part.  Some pedons have Btnz or Btnkz horizons.\nThe Bzg and Bkzg horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 to 5 and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  They are silty clay, clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay.  They have few or common accumulations of salts and are slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is clay, silty clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam, but is stratified with coarser material below 40 inches in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  Buried horizons are common below depths of 40 inches.  Most pedons have few to many, faint to prominent redox features in the Bzg, Bkzg, and Cg horizons.  Some pedons have textures of sand to fine sandy loam below depths of 40 inches and some pedons contain up to 50 percent by volume of pebbles."

Surfaces are plane or concave.  These soils formed in clayey alluvium.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 26 inches."

Bon soils do not have a natric horizon and are on higher positions in the landscape.  Egas soils do not have a natric horizon and are on slightly higher positions in the micro-relief.  Farmsworth soils have thicker surface horizons and are leached of salts to greater depths and are on slightly higher positions in the micro-relief."
