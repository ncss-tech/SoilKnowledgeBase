  "OVERVIEW": "The Des Moines series consists of deep and very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived predominantly from basalt.  Des Moines soils are on mountain sideslopes.  Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
