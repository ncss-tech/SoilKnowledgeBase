  "OVERVIEW": "The Duck series consist of very deep, moderately well drained soils. They formed in a thin, loamy surface layer containing red, hydrous oxide clays over sandy alluvial deposits on stream terraces.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the loamy surface and high or very high in the rest of the soil.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters, and mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
