  "OVERVIEW": "The Detrital series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on fan terraces.  These soils formed in mixed igneous and metamorphic alluvium.  Slopes range from 1 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",
