  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 25 through 58 centimeters. Depth to the dense till ranges from 25 to 51 centimeters from the top of the mineral soil surface. Depth to bedrock is greater than 152 centimeters. Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent by volume. The rock fragments are commonly dominated by channers and gravel followed in order of prevalence by flagstones, cobbles, and stones. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid in the solum and very strongly acid through slightly alkaline in the substratum. Clay content ranges from 18 through 27 percent in the particle size control section.\nThe O horizon, where present has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4. It is fibric, sapric and/or hemic material.\nThe Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Bh or Bhs horizons, where present, have hue of 5YR through 10YR, with value and chroma of 3 or less. The Bs horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 8. It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe Cd layer has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silty clay loam, silt loam, loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. Arrangement of soil particles into aggregates is considered to be inherited from the parent material(geogenic). Consistence is firm or very firm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.\nThe Conant and Perham are soils in related families. Conant soils lack the dense lodgement till substratum. Perham soils are moderately deep to dense till and are moderately well drained."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Daigle soils are on till plains and ridges. The soils formed in dense till derived mainly from slate, shale, metasediments, and some phyllite. Slope is dominantly 2 through 8 percent but ranges from 0 through 25 percent. The climate is humid and cool temperate. The mean annual average precipitation ranges from 905 through 1002 millimeters, and mean average annual temperature is 3.1 Celsius. The frost-free season ranges from 80 through 105 days. Elevation ranges from 37 through 579 meters above mean sea level."

Elliottsville, Ragmuff, and Monson soils are shallower to bedrock and occupy the highest positions in the landscape. Perham soils are better drained and occupy higher positions in the landscape."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly forest. Common tree species include red spruce, white spruce, balsam fir, northern white cedar and to a lesser extent sugar maple, red maple, paper birch, yellow birch, and quaking aspen. Cleared areas are mostly in hay and pasture. Some areas are used for potatoes and oats where they occur adjacent to better drained soils."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This revision reflects reclassification from Loamy, isotic, frigid, shallow Aquic Haplorthods to Loamy, mixed, active, frigid, shallow Aquic Haplorthods to conform with Keys to Soil Taxonomy 11th Edition. See below for reference pedon information.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 15 centimeters (Oa and E horizons).\nb. Albic horizon - the zone from 8 to 15 centimeters (E horizon).\nc. Spodic horizon - the zone from 15 to 30 centimeters (Bs1 and Bs2 horizons).\nd. Aquic feature - redoximorphic features within 76 centimeters of the mineral soil surface.\ne. Densic contact - at 55 centimeters (47 centimeters from the mineral soil surface).\nf. Densic materials - 55 to 165 centimeters (Cd horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: This pedon was sampled in 2007, USDA - NRCS National Soil Survey Laboratory pedon number 09NO161. Other source of data used in establishing taxonomic class and range in characteristics are Maine Agricultural Experiment Station Technical Bulletin Number 75; NRCS characterization data; and composite data from the Field Appraisal of Resource Management Systems compiled by Dr. Paul R. Hepler, Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, University of Maine at Orono, Orono, Maine.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
