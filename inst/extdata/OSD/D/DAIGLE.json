  "STATES": "ME",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Daigle series consists of somewhat poorly drained soils on till plains and ridges. They are shallow to dense lodgement till and very deep to bedrock. These soils formed in till. Estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the mineral solum and low or moderately low in the substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual average temperature is about 3.1 Celsius, and mean annual average precipitation is about 905 millimeters at the type location.",

Depth to the dense till ranges from 25 to 51 centimeters from the top of the mineral soil surface. Depth to bedrock is greater than 152 centimeters. Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent by volume. The rock fragments are commonly dominated by channers and gravel followed in order of prevalence by flagstones, cobbles, and stones.

Clay content ranges from 18 through 27 percent in the particle size control section.\nThe O horizon, where present has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4. It is fibric, sapric and/or hemic material.\nThe Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Daigle soils are on till plains and ridges. The soils formed in dense till derived mainly from slate, shale, metasediments, and some phyllite. Slope is dominantly 2 through 8 percent but ranges from 0 through 25 percent. The climate is humid and cool temperate. The mean annual average precipitation ranges from 905 through 1002 millimeters, and mean average annual temperature is 3.1 Celsius. The frost-free season ranges from 80 through 105 days. Elevation ranges from 37 through 579 meters above mean sea level."

See below for reference pedon information.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 15 centimeters (Oa and E horizons).\nb. Albic horizon - the zone from 8 to 15 centimeters (E horizon).\nc. Spodic horizon - the zone from 15 to 30 centimeters (Bs1 and Bs2 horizons).\nd. Aquic feature - redoximorphic features within 76 centimeters of the mineral soil surface.\ne. Densic contact - at 55 centimeters (47 centimeters from the mineral soil surface).\nf. Densic materials - 55 to 165 centimeters (Cd horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: This pedon was sampled in 2007, USDA - NRCS National Soil Survey Laboratory pedon number 09NO161. Other source of data used in establishing taxonomic class and range in characteristics are Maine Agricultural Experiment Station Technical Bulletin Number 75; NRCS characterization data; and composite data from the Field Appraisal of Resource Management Systems compiled by Dr. Paul R. Hepler, Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, University of Maine at Orono, Orono, Maine.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
