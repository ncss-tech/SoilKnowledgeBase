It is silt loam or loam and is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam, silt loam or clay loam but has strata of silty clay loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam in some pedons.   It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 5 moist and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam or clay loam but is stratified with layers of silty clay loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in some pedons.   Some pedons have redox features below a depth of 40 inches.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  It has few to many accumulations of carbonate.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It typically is loam, but some pedons are stratified with layers of sandy loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Some pedons have mottles below 40 inches.

Slope gradients typically are less than 4 percent, but range from 0 to 15 percent.  Davis soils formed in local loamy alluvium or colluvium.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 26 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F."

Betts, Clarno, and Ethan soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick and are on landscapes above the Davis soils.  Blendon soils are on similar landscapes and have a coarse-loamy control section.  Bon soils are on flood plains and have carbonates above depths of 20 inches.  Clamo and Tetonka soils are in the fine family and are more poorly drained.  Clamo soils are on lower positions in the landscape.  Tetonka soils are in upland depressions.    Lamo soils have a fine-silty control section and are in lower parts of the landscape on bottom lands."
