  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 80 inches.   Drexel soils are loam or silt loam with from 5 to 10 percent clay, 65 to 75 percent silt plus very fine sand and angular shale fragments ranging from 10 to 20 percent in upper A horizons and from 35 to 75 percent below depths ranging from 6 to 20 inches, increasing in volume with increasing depth.  Shale fragments have an estimated density of 2 and a hardness of 1 or 2.  The annual soil temperature ranges from 44 degrees to 47 degrees F. and the average summer soil temperature ranges from 59 degrees to 64 degrees F. without an 0 horizon in cleared areas.  The soils range from moderately acid to neutral and have base saturation of 65 to 80 percent in the upper foot of the profile and 85 to 95 percent in the lower horizons.  The cation exchange capacity-clay ratio ranges from 1.2 to 1.9 below the 0 horizon.  Hue ranges from 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  The A1 horizon has value of 5 or 6.  The A2 horizon has value of 7 or 8 and chroma of 2 or 3.  The lamellae have value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 or 4."
