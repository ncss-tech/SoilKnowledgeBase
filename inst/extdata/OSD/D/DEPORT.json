  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to about\n65 inches.  Clay content throughout ranges from 45 to 60 percent.  Few to common intersecting slickensides 2 to 8 inches wide begin\nat depths ranging from about 12 to 20 inches below the surface.  Cycles of microdepressions and microknolls are repeated each 4 to\n10 feet.  In virgin areas these are expressed as gilgai relief.  Depth to moist values greater then 3.5 range from 0 to 5 inches in the microknolls and 6 to 11 inches in the microdepression.  Depth\nto the C horizon ranges from about 40 to 50 inches in the\nmicroknolls to about 50 to 65 inches in the microdepressions.  Calcareous material, where present, follows the wavy upper\nboundary of the C horizon but extends in the AC3 in some\nmicroknolls.\nThe A horizon is dark gray (10YR 4/1) or gray (10YR 5/1) and some pedons contain a few fine mottles of grayish brown or yellowish brown.  It is medium acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe AC1 horizon is gray (10YR 5/1; 2.5Y N 5/0; 5Y 5/1).  Moist\nvalues are 4 in more than 50 percent of the pedon.  Mottles range from few to many and are faint to distinct in shades of gray,\nbrown, olive, and yellow.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to\nmildly alkaline.  The AC2g and AC3g horizons are gray (10YR 5/1, 6/1), grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2), light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4),\nlight brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2), or light gray (10YR 7/1; 2.5Y 7/2;\n5Y 7/2).  Mottles are few to many faint to distinct shades of\ngray, brown, olive, or yellow.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid\nto moderately alkaline and a few pedons are calcareous below about\n30 inches.\nThe C horizon is light brownish gray, light gray, light olive\ngray, light yellowish brown, or brownish yellow with many mottles\nof these same colors and olive yellow and reddish yellow.  It is noncalcareous or calcareous shale, shaly clay, or clay that is moderately alkaline and contains a few soft calcium carbonate\nbodies."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same\nfamily.  Other soils are the Beaumont, Burleson, Clarita, Eutaw, Ferris, Garner, Hollywood, Houston Black, Lake Charles, Randall,\nand San Saba series.  Beaumont, Garner, Hollywood, and Lake\nCharles soils are dry for shorter periods of time.  In addition, Beaumont soils are strongly acid in the A and AC horizons.\nBurleson, Clarita, Hollywood, Houston Black, Lake Charles,\nRandall, and San Saba soils have moist values of less than 3.5 to depths greater than 12 inches.  Eutaw soils are extremely acid in\nthe A and B horizons and are of a very-fine family.  Ferris soils have chromas greater than 1.5 in the upper 12 inches and are calcareous."

The soils formed in alkaline cretaceous shale and marl.  Average annual precipitation at the type location is about 45\ninches, average annual temperature is about 64 degrees F., and Thornthwaite P-E index is 76.\nGeographicallly Associated Soils:  These include the competing Burleson and Houston Black series and the Bryarly, Panola, and\nWilson series.  Bryarly, Panola, and Wilson soils have argillic horizons.  They are all on similar positions."
