  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Dolman series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in silty alluvium from loess and weathered volcanic ash over loamy or sandy alluvium from igneous materials.  The Dolman soils are on old dissected terraces and plains.  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Chuska and Yahoo soils are shallow to a duripan.  Purdam soils have fine-silty argillic horizons. All the above soils are on the same landform as Dolman.  Tulch soils do not have duripans, have fine-silty control sections and are on lower terraces and along large drainageways."

These will be further investigation from an MLRA project level as to the accepted terms for use.\nThe term silty alluvium used in this series concept infers a localized influence on the mixed loess and weathered volcanic ash soil mantle by overland flow of running water."
