  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dolman soils are on old dissected terraces and on plug domes (buttes), lava flow lobes, pressure ridges and tumuli on shield volcanoes.  These soils formed in silty alluvium from loess and weathered volcanic ash over loamy or sandy alluvium from igneous materials.  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 3,000 to 4,350 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches.  The average annual temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 120 to 150 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Sluka soils and the Blacknest, Chuska, Purdam, Sluka, Tulch, and Yahoo soils.  Blacknest soils do not have duripans.  Chuska and Yahoo soils are shallow to a duripan.  Purdam soils have fine-silty argillic horizons. All the above soils are on the same landform as Dolman.  Tulch soils do not have duripans, have fine-silty control sections and are on lower terraces and along large drainageways."

These will be further investigation from an MLRA project level as to the accepted terms for use.\nThe term silty alluvium used in this series concept infers a localized influence on the mixed loess and weathered volcanic ash soil mantle by overland flow of running water.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
