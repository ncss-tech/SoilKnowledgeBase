  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Ponding is frequent and very long duration during February to July.  Redox concentrations are generally absent or faint in all horizons.  Hue is typically 5Y, or 2.5Y, but ranges to 10YR.  There is an irregular decrease in organic matter with depth.  The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to the substratum (3C) is 25 to 40 inches.  The solum has an SAR of 13 to 25 and is strongly or very strongly alkaline.  The particle size control section averages 18 to 25 percent clay.\nThe A horizon is silt loam or fine sandy loam with 10 to 20 percent clay.  It has 5 to 10 percent calcium carbonate.\nThe 2Bkn horizon has a value dry of 7 or 8, and moist of 5 or 6.  The chroma is 1, 2, or 3.  It is clay loam or sandy clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay.\nThe 3C horizon has value dry of 6 through 8, and moist of 4 through 6.  Chromas are 1 through 3.  It is sandy loam, loamy fine sand and loamy sand with 5 to 18 percent clay.  SAR is 2 to 15."

The climate is characterized by cold moist winters, and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period is 50 to 80 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nmollic epipedon - from 0 to 18 inches (Akn horizons)\naquic conditions - the soil is assumed to meet aquic conditions within the upper 20 inch zone.  Based on laboratory data the amount of iron in these soils is extremely low and thus the formation of iron concentrations is limited.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
