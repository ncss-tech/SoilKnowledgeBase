Redox concentrations are generally absent or faint in all horizons.  Hue is typically 5Y, or 2.5Y, but ranges to 10YR.  There is an irregular decrease in organic matter with depth.  The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to the substratum (3C) is 25 to 40 inches.  The solum has an SAR of 13 to 25 and is strongly or very strongly alkaline.  The particle size control section averages 18 to 25 percent clay.\nThe A horizon is silt loam or fine sandy loam with 10 to 20 percent clay.  It has 5 to 10 percent calcium carbonate.\nThe 2Bkn horizon has a value dry of 7 or 8, and moist of 5 or 6.  The chroma is 1, 2, or 3.  It is clay loam or sandy clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay.\nThe 3C horizon has value dry of 6 through 8, and moist of 4 through 6.  Chromas are 1 through 3.  It is sandy loam, loamy fine sand and loamy sand with 5 to 18 percent clay.  SAR is 2 to 15."

Based on laboratory data the amount of iron in these soils is extremely low and thus the formation of iron concentrations is limited."
