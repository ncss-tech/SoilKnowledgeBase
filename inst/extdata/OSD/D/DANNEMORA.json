  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 45 to 150 centimeters. Depth to bedrock is greater than 152 centimeters. Depth to the top of the fragipan ranges from 30 to 55 centimeters. Rock fragment content ranges from 1 to 40 percent, by volume, in the mineral solum above the fragipan and from 20 to 70 percent in the fragipan and substratum. Rock fragments are dominantly gravel and channers, but also include some cobbles and stones.\nO horizons, where present, are composed of fibric, hemic, or sapric material. Reaction ranges from ultra acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 2 through 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. In uncultivated areas, A horizons may be present and have colors similar to the Ap horizon, except chroma ranges from 0 through 2. Texture ranges from silt loam through sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through slightly acid.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silt loam through sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is subangular blocky or platy, or the material is massive. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through slightly acid. In some pedons, the E horizon is replaced by a B or BE horizon in part or in total.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is similar to the E horizon. Structure is subangular blocky, or the horizon is massive. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 or more. Texture ranges from silt loam through sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through neutral. Some pedons have a 2Bx horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture ranges from loam to loamy fine sand in the fine-earth fraction. It is massive and may have plate-like divisions. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through neutral. Some pedons have a 2C horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.\nSimilar soils in related families are the Erie, Camroden, Dalton, Marcy, Morris, Norchip, Ontusia, Rexford, Scriba, Shohola, Trussel, Volusia, Wallington, and Wiscoy series. The Camroden, Dalton, Erie, Marcy, Norchip, Ontusia, Shohola, Trussel, Volusia, Wallington, and Wiscoy soils have a different textural class. Dalton, Erie, Morris, Rexford, Scriba, Shohola, Volusia, Wallington, and Wiscoy soils are mesic. Marcy soils do not allow a chroma of greater than 2 between 15 and 75 cm of the mineral surface. Trussel soils are semiactive."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 through 1727 mm, mean annual temperature ranges from 1 through 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season ranges from 90 through 140 days. Elevation ranges from 45 through 610 meters above sea level."

Adams, Croghan, Fishcreek (T), and Naumburg soils developed in nearby sandy deltaic deposits. Colton, Duane, and Swancott (T) soils developed in gravelly glacial outwash. Well drained Worth, moderately well drained Empeyville, somewhat poorly drained Westbury, and very poorly drained Tughill soils are drainage associates of Dannemora soils. Highmarket (T) soils are well drained and do not have a fragipan. Tughill soils do not have a fragipan."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: 1. This series was previously classified as Typic Fragiaquepts, but field data (colors and redoximorphic features) suggest it is Aeric.\n2. Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\nOchric Epipedon - the zone from the surface through 18 cm (Oa, Eg, and part of Bg1 horizon).\nCambic horizon - the zone from 11 through 47 cm (part of Bg1 and Bg2 horizon).\nFragipan - the zone from a depth of 47 through 76 cm (Bx horizon).\nAquepts - as evidenced low chroma matrix colors and redoximorphic features within a depth of 50 cm from the mineral surface (Eg and Bg horizons).\nAeric subgroup - as evidenced by the matrix color at 47 cm (Bx horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA: OSD Pedon, ID #10NY049022\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
