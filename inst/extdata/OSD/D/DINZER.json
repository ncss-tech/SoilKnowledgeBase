    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is less than 47 degrees F. with an 0 horizon.  The soils have an udic moisture regime but have a short dry period of less than 45 consecutive days during the late summer.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The 10 to 40 inch control section is fine sandy loam or sandy loam and averages less than 10 percent clay and 35 to 70 percent rock fragments, dominantly cobblestones.  The thickness of the solum ranges from 12 to 24 inches.\nThe A2 horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 through 7 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry and is intermittent in occurrence.\nThe B2ir horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 through 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is friable or very friable.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  Rock fragments commonly increase with increasing depth."

Also, Evaro soils have A2 horizons 5 to 15 inches thick and have slightly acid to mildly alkaline C horizons and Homestead soils have a thin loess mantle.  Lastance soils have continuous A2 horizons up to 3 inches thick, upper Bir horizons with hue of 5YR or 2.5YR and firm consistence.  Mt. Hood soils have continuous A2 horizons up to 4 inches thick and highly variegated Bir horizons with hue of 10YR through 5YR."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dinzer soils are on ridges and hillsides in glaciated valleys of the Cascade Mountains at elevations of 3,000 to 5,000 feet.  Slope gradients range from 5 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in glacial till weathered mostly from andesitic and basaltic rocks of Pleistocene and Pliocene age.  The climate is humid and cool.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 55 to 90 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F., the average January temperature is 29 degrees F., and the average July temperature is 57 degrees F.  The frost-free season is less than 50 days. GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Lastance soils and the Oneonta soils.  Oneonta soils have umbric epipedons and lack spodic horizons."
