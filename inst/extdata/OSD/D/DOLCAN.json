Menefee soils have less than 15 percent coarse fragments below the A horizon and hues yellower than 7.5YR. Mittenbutte soils have less than 18 percent clay. Sipapu soils receive about half their precipitation from July to September and have pararock fragments. Spearfish soils have accumulations of gypsum in the C and Cr horizons."
