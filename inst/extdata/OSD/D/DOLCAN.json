  "OVERVIEW": "The Dolcan series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  Dolcan soils are in canyons and on hills.  Slopes range from 6 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
