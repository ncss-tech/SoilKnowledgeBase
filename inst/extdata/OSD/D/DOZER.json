  "OVERVIEW": "The Dozer series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained,  soils with moderately slow permeability above very slowly permeable limestone bedrock.  They formed in colluvium from limestone bedrock.  These soils are on nearly level to very steep hills. Slope ranges from 5 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",

The Birdspring and St. Thomas and Umberci soils are intermittently moist in the upper part of the moisture control section for less than 20 days during the summer months. These soils also receive winter precipitation and support vegetation typical of the Mojave Desert (MLRA 30) environment.  Mariscal soils have mean annual soil temperatures greater than 67 degrees and are derived from chalky and marly material.  Saguaro soils have 5 to 20 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Umberci soils have 8 to 14 percent clay in the particle-size control section."
