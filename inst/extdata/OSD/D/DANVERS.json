  "OVERVIEW": "The Danvers series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium, or loess from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
