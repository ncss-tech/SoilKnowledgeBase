  "OVERVIEW": "The Dubach series consists of very deep, well drained soils.  They are moderately permeable in the upper part of the solum and moderately slowly permeable in the lower part.  They formed in loamy sediments on stream terraces on Coastal Plain uplands.  Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent.",
