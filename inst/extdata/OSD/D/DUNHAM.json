  "OVERVIEW": "The Dunham series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on nearly level or depressional areas of outwash plains and stream terraces. They formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy outwash and are deep or moderately deep to gravelly deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 860 mm (34 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F).",

The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) in the solum and very high (> 141.11 micrometers/s) in the underlying material.

It was determined that Dunham soils range from 15 to 70 percent gravel in the lower part of series control section. Drummer series will be restricted to 0 to 15 percent gravel in the lower part.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 30 cm (12 inches) (Ap and A horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from approximately 30 to 99 cm (12 to 39 inches) (BAg, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, and 2Btg4 horizons); aquic conditions - redoximorphic features present in the zone from approximately 30 to 152 cm (12 to 60 inches) (BAg, Btg1, Btg2, 2Btg3, 2Btg4, 3Cg, and 3C horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
