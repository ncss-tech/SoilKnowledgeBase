Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 12 degrees C (44 to 53 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 740 to 1020 mm (29 to 40 inches), frost-free period ranges from 140 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 155 to 320 meters (510 to 1050 feet) above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Grundelein and well drained Waupecan soils form a drainage sequence with Dunham soils. The well drained Bowes and Rush soils and the somewhat poorly drained Millstream soils do not have mollic epipedons."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. In drained conditions an apparent high water table is at 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface in most years and, in undrained conditions, it is 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 foot) below the surface. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) in the solum and very high (> 141.11 micrometers/s) in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the solum and very rapid in the underlying material."

    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was formerly mapped Drummer in McHenry County. It is named for the McHenry County township in which the type location resides. It was determined that Dunham soils range from 15 to 70 percent gravel in the lower part of series control section. Drummer series will be restricted to 0 to 15 percent gravel in the lower part.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 30 cm (12 inches) (Ap and A horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from approximately 30 to 99 cm (12 to 39 inches) (BAg, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, and 2Btg4 horizons); aquic conditions - redoximorphic features present in the zone from approximately 30 to 152 cm (12 to 60 inches) (BAg, Btg1, Btg2, 2Btg3, 2Btg4, 3Cg, and 3C horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
