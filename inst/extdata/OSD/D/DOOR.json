    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the base of soil development ranges from 40 to 80 inches or more.   The amount of shale and gravel in the A horizon ranges from 1 to 15 percent and in the B horizon ranges from about 5 to 30 percent.  The umbric epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches in thickness and includes the upper part of the argillic horizon in some pedons.  The solum commonly is strongly acid or very strongly acid except for the umbric epipedon which ranges from moderately acid to neutral.  In some pedons the lower part of the solum is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is loam, sandy loam or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 5.  In some pedons the chroma ranges from 2 to 6 in the lower part.   It is commonly a loam or sandy clay loam and subhorizon include sandy loam and clay loam or channery or gravelly analogues of any of these textures.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It commonly is gravelly analogues of sand, gravelly sand or channery sand.  The 2C horizon is moderately acid to neutral directly below the control section and the horizon is moderately alkaline (calcaureous) at depths ranging from 6 to 8 feet or more."

Dumfries soils solum thickness ranges from 18 to 40 inches. The Ebbing soils do not contain shale fragments.  Grayford soils have a lithic contact that ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Kell soils have a paralithic contact that ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Lamotte soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder\nin the lower part of the series control section.

The Coupee is similar to Door soils except it has a contrasting layer above 40 inches.  Lydick soils are well drained soils occurring on similar slopes but have a thinner dark surface layer.  They often occur in the landscape between Door and Tracy soils.  Tracy soils have light colored surfaces, are well drained, and occur on nearly level to moderately steep slopes.  Troxel soils occur in the depressions and have thick dark surface."
