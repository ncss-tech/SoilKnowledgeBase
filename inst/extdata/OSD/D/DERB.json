  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 40 inches. Depth to shale bedrock ranges from 40 inches to 10 feet or more. Coarse fragment range from 0 to 10 percent in the solum and from 5 to 20 percent in the C horizons. Coarse fragment content in both the solum and substratum include up to 5 percent larger than 3 inches. The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid. In some pedons, the soil becomes less acid below depths of 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 and 4 and\nchroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It has\nweak or moderate, fine and medium granular structure and very friable or friable consistence.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. Faces of peds dominantly have chroma of 2 or less. High chroma mottles make up 50 percent or more in some subhorizons if the matrix chroma is 2 or less. The Bw horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam. It has weak or moderate structure, ranging from medium or coarse subangular blocky structure to medium, or coarse prismatic parting to fine to coarse blocky. It has friable or firm consistence.\nThe BC horizon has color and texture ranges similar to the Bw horizons; however, hue is commonly 2.5Y and 5Y. They have a moderate, medium, or coarse prismatic structure parting to weak or moderate, thin or medium platy.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4. It is silt loam or light silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. It is massive or has weak or moderate medium or thick platy structure."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Derb series is the only known soil in this family. Burdett, Darien, Fremont, Hornell, Kanona, Orpark and Patchin are similar soils in related families.  Burdett, Darien, Fremont, Orpark and Patchin have a fine loamy particle size control section. In addition, Burdett and Darien soils have argillic horizons. Hornell and Kanona soils have more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Derb soils are nearly level to sloping soils on plains and glaciated dissected plateaus where shale bedrock is commonly within depths of 10 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. The soils developed in glacial till derived from soft shale and siltstone. The climate is humid and cool temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches; mean annual temperature from 46 degrees to 56 degrees F.; and mean growing season from 120 to 180 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Fremont, Hornell, and Orpark series and the Churchville and Manlius soils. Churchville soils formed in clayey lacustrine sediments that overlie glacial till and are on lower lying landscapes. Manlius soils are well drained, have loamy skeletal particle size control sections and shale bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches and are on typical bedrock controlled landforms."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained. Runoff is slow to medium. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow in the solum and slow in the substratum. The soils have a perched seasonal high water table at depths of 6 to 18 inches from November through May."
