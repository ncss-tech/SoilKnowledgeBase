  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are dry in the soil moisture control section for 30 to 45 days during the summer. The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F. The upper 7 to 14 inches has acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, volcanic glass content of 10 to 20 percent and moist bulk density of 0.85 to 1.00 g/cc. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches. Depth to bedrock is typically greater than 60 inches but ranges to 40 inches. The particle size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is ashy loam with 15 to 25 percent clay and 10 to 20 percent cobbles and 5 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe BA horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is ashy loam or ashy clay loam with 18 to 27 percent clay and 10 to 20 percent cobbles and 5 to 20 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is loam or clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay. The upper portion of this horizon has 10 to 25 percent cobbles and 25 to 35 percent gravel. The lower portion has 0 to 15 percent stones, 25 to 40 percent cobbles, and 15 to 30 percent gravel."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Downards soils are on canyon back slopes of deeply dissected plateaus, and on hills and mountains. These soils are deep on south-facing slopes and very deep on north-facing slopes. Elevation is 2,000 to 3,000 feet on north-facing side slopes and 3,000 to 4,000 feet on south-facing side slopes. Slopes are 15 to 90 percent. These soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium derived from basalt. The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and warm, moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 35 inches. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost free period is 70 to 120 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Emily, Gwin, Kettenbach, Klicker, and Wolot soils. These soils are mesic. Emily soils are xeric and are situated on foot slopes of canyons. Gwin and Kettenbach soils are found on south slopes and have argillic horizons. Gwin soils are shallow to bedrock and Kettenbach and Klicker soils are moderately deep. Klicker soils are on south-facing side slopes above 3,000 feet. Wolot soils lack rock fragments, have an ochric epipedon, and are positioned on terraces."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - 1 to 21 inches (A, BA, and 2Bw1 horizons). The 2Bw2 horizon has mollic colors but lacks the required organic carbon.\nCambic horizon - 21 to 62 inches (2Bw2 horizon).\nParticle size control section - from 11 to 41 inches (lower part of BA, 2Bw1, and upper part of 2Bw2 horizons)\nAndic features - 1 to 13 inches (A and BA horizons)\nUSFS plant association - ABGR/AGCL\nClassification revised 02/01 from Haploborolls to Hapludolls based on Soil Taxonomy 8th edition.\nThis series concept of frigid is below the elevation range convention of 2,800 feet for Wallowa County, Oregon although the plant community has been consistently correlated to udic and frigid soil moisture and temperature regimes in other parts of the Blue Mountains (Oregon and Idaho). The rainfall distribution in combination with ash influence are the primary factors reflective in the udic/frigid consideration.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
