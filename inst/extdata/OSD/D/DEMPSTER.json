    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to stratified sand and gravel ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is silt loam, but some pedons are silty clay loam.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam averaging between 24 and 30 percent clay.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Masses of carbonates are common or many.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y.  It is gravelly sand, gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly sand and very gravelly loamy sand and contains 15 to 50 percent pebbles.  Pebbles and stones are coated on the undersides by carbonates, especially in the upper part of the horizon.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline."

They do not have sand and gravel above depths of 60 inches. The Graceville soils typically are on slightly lower positions or are on similar landscapes and have sand and gravel at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  The Talmo soils are typically on crests and knolls and have sand and gravel within a depth of 14 inches."
