  "STATES": "IA,MN,SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Dempster series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in silty sediments overlying outwash sand and gravel.  Permeability is moderate in the silty material and moderately rapid or rapid in the underlying sand and gravel.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Thickness of mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is silt loam, but some pedons are silty clay loam.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam averaging between 24 and 30 percent clay.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Masses of carbonates are common or many.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y.  It is gravelly sand, gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly sand and very gravelly loamy sand and contains 15 to 50 percent pebbles.  Pebbles and stones are coated on the undersides by carbonates, especially in the upper part of the horizon.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline."
