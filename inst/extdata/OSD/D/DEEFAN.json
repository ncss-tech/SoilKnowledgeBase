  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Deefan series consists of well drained soils that are very shallow to a strongly cemented hardpan.  They formed in alluvium from mixed rocks.  Deefan soils are on alluvial fan piedmonts and ballenas. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C and the mean annual precipitation is about 130 mm.",
