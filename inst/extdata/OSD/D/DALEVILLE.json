  "OVERVIEW": "The Daleville series consists of poorly drained soils that formed in loamy marine or fluvial sediment.  Permeability is slow.  These nearly level soils are on uplands and terraces of the Southern Coastal Plain.  They are saturated late in winter and early in spring.  Water runs off the surface very slowly.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid, except the surface layers in areas that have been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, sandy loam, or silt loam.\nThe E horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma 1 or 2.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, sandy loam, or silt loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles are few to many in shades of brown, red, or yellow.  In some pedons the lower part of the Bt horizon is mottled in shades of gray, red, or brown.  The upper 20 inches of the B horizon has 20 to 35 percent clay and more than 30 percent silt.  Black and brown concretions, if present, are few to many. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam."

Bethera, Coxville, and Leaf soils have a clayey control section.  Grantham and Trebloc soils have a fine-silty control section.  Myatt soils have a solum less than 60 inches thick.

Myatt, Leaf, Smithton, and Trebloc soils are on similar landscapes.  Kinston soils do not have an argillic horizon and are on flood plains.  Mashulaville soils are on similar landscapes but have a fragipan.  Quitman, Savannah, and Stough soils, which are on slightly higher ridges, are better drained; also, Savannah soils have a fragipan."

The water table fluctuates between the surface and a depth of 1.0 foot late in winter and early in spring.  Most areas of this soil are flooded for brief periods, unless protected."
