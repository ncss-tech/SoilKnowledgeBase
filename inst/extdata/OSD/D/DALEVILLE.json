  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid, except the surface layers in areas that have been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, sandy loam, or silt loam.\nThe E horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma 1 or 2.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, sandy loam, or silt loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles are few to many in shades of brown, red, or yellow.  In some pedons the lower part of the Bt horizon is mottled in shades of gray, red, or brown.  The upper 20 inches of the B horizon has 20 to 35 percent clay and more than 30 percent silt.  Black and brown concretions, if present, are few to many. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Rains in the same family and the Bethera, Coxville, Grantham, Leaf, Myatt, Smithton, Trebloc, and Woodington series.  Bethera, Coxville, and Leaf soils have a clayey control section.  Grantham and Trebloc soils have a fine-silty control section.  Myatt soils have a solum less than 60 inches thick.  Rains soils have less than 30 percent silt in the control section.  Smithton and Woodington soils have a coarse-loamy control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Daleville soils are on uplands and terraces of the Southern Coastal Plain.  These are nearly level soils that formed in loamy sediment.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The climate is warm and humid.  Mean annual precipitation is about 52 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Leaf, Myatt, Smithton, and Trebloc series, and the Kinston, Mashulaville, Quitman, Savannah, and Stough series.  Myatt, Leaf, Smithton, and Trebloc soils are on similar landscapes.  Kinston soils do not have an argillic horizon and are on flood plains.  Mashulaville soils are on similar landscapes but have a fragipan.  Quitman, Savannah, and Stough soils, which are on slightly higher ridges, are better drained; also, Savannah soils have a fragipan."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Daleville soils are poorly drained.  Runoff is very slow, and permeability is slow.  The water table fluctuates between the surface and a depth of 1.0 foot late in winter and early in spring.  Most areas of this soil are flooded for brief periods, unless protected."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils mainly are in forests of water oak, willow oak, maple, sweetgum, ash, cypress, and loblolly pine.  Some areas are cleared and used for growing soybeans, pasture, and hay."
