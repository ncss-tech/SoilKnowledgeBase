  "OVERVIEW": "The Division series consists of shallow to a duripan, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources influenced by volcanic ash.  Division soils are on stream terraces and lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 130 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C.",
