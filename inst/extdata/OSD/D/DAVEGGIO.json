  "OVERVIEW": "The Daveggio series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountain ridges.  They formed in material weathered from micaceous schist with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderate.  Slope ranges from 15 to 35 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 48 inches.",
