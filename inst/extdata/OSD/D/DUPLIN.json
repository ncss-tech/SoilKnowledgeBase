The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid, except where limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y or it is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 3. Where these horizons are less than 10 inches thick color values can range to 2 or 3. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or loamy sand.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture range is the same as A or Ap horizon.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. It is loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. The lower Bt horizon is mottled or are gray with high mottles. Gray mottles with chroma of 2 or less are within 30 inches of the soil surface. It is sandy clay, clay, clay loam, or sandy clay loam. Weighted clay average is 35 to 55 percent in control section. Silt content is less than 30 percent.\nThe BC horizon, where present, is similar in color to the lower Bt horizon. Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 6. It is sandy clay loam, sandy loam, sandy clay, or clay. In some pedons the lower Bt horizon has a few strong brown to red nodules of plinthite."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Persanti series is the only series in the same family. Persanti soils have strongly developed structure in some parts of the Bt horizon and contains significant amounts of vermiculite. Ackwater, Angie, Craven, Dogue, Dunbar, Exum, Foreston, Goldston, Lenoir, Marlboro, Nahunta, Wahee, and Wrightsboro series are similar soils in other families. Ackwater, Angie, Craven, Dogue, Lenoir, and Wahee, soils have mixed mineralogy. Also the Dunbar, Lenoir, Nahunta, and Wahee soils have mottles with chroma of 2 or less in the upper Bt horizon and have lower Bt horizons dominated by chroma of 2 or less. Marlboro soils lack chroma 2 or less mottles within 30 inches of the soil surface. Exum soils have fine-silty particle size class. Foreston is coarse-loamy and Goldsboro, Wrightsboro soils are fine-loamy. Wrightsboro soils also have a clayey Bt horizon."

The soil formed in unconsolidated clayey sediments. Near the type location, mean annual air temperature is 63 degrees F. Mean annual rainfall is about 46 inches."

Aycock, Dothan, Norfolk, and Orangeburg soils have B2t horizons with less than 35 percent clay. Bayboro, Coxville, Grady, Lynchburg, McColl, and Rains soils are wetter and have dominant chroma of 2 or less in the Bt horizons. Faceville soils have Bt horizons in hues of 5 YR or redder.
