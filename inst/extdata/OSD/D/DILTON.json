Angular fragments of limestone and chert range from 0 and 15 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 2, and chroma of 1,2, or neutral.  Mottles or redox concentrations in shades of gray, yellow, and brown range from none to common.  Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or less.  Some pedons have hue of neutral and value of 4 or 5.  Mottles and redox concentrations in shades of brown, yellow, and gray range from few to common.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay."

In addition, Dekoven and Lanton soils have mollic epipedons greater than 24 inches thick and have less than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Egam and Godwin soils also have mollic epipedons greater than 24 inches thick.  Godwin soils have value of 3 or more immediately below the mollic epipedon."

The soils formed in fine-textured alluvium.  Outcrops of limestone bedrock are common in the landscape.  Near the type location, mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 45 inches."

The Gladeville and Barfield series have chroma of 3 or more immediately below the mollic epipedon and are on uplands.  Talbott series do not have a mollic epipedon and are greater than 20 inches to bedrock.
