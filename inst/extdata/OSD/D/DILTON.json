Angular fragments of limestone and chert range from 0 and 15 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 2, and chroma of 1,2, or neutral.  Mottles or redox concentrations in shades of gray, yellow, and brown range from none to common.  Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or less.  Some pedons have hue of neutral and value of 4 or 5.  Mottles and redox concentrations in shades of brown, yellow, and gray range from few to common.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay."

In addition, Dekoven and Lanton soils have mollic epipedons greater than 24 inches thick and have less than 35 percent clay in the control section.
