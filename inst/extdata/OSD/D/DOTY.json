  "OVERVIEW": "The Doty series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in silty and gravelly alluvium weathered from basic igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Doty soils are on old stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Doty soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for more than 60 consecutive days within the 3 months following the summer solstice.  Mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F.  The control section is dominantly silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay and 15 percent or more fine sand or coarser.  These soils are slightly or moderately acid.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through ?\nThe B horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist or dry."

They formed in silty alluvium and gravel and weathered from basic igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Doty soils occur in a marine type climate with 50 to 70 inches annual precipitation occurring mostly as rain during the winter.  Mean January temperature is 38 degrees F., mean July temperature is 65 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 52 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 150 to 200 days."
