  "OVERVIEW": "The Delameter series consists of very deep somewhat excessively drained soils formed in avalanche debris flow material.  Delameter soils are on highly irregular, dissected valley floors.  Slopes are mostly 0 to 20 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 100 inches and average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The particle-size control section averages 15 to 30 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregates  in the fine earth fraction and is 5 to 25 percent pumice and 35 to 70 percent rock fragments.  The upper 7 to 14 inches of this soil is assumed to be 30 to 60 percent volcanic ash and pumice.  The soil is moderately acid or slightly acid throughout.  Some profiles contain woody organic debris, composed of logs, branches, and bark.\nThe C1 horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 moist, 4 to 8 dry and chroma of 1 to 4 moist and dry.  Some areas have a stony or bouldery surface.  Some areas have a surface layer dominated by cinders.\nThe C2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loamy sand, extremely gravelly loamy sand or extremely cobbly sand."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Delameter soils are on highly irregular, dissected valley floors and formed in avalanche debris flow from the May 18 eruption of Mt. St.  Helens  These soils are in the Toutle River Valley at elevations of 1,200 to 2,700 feet.  Slopes are mostly 0 to 20 percent, but some short slopes range to 100 percent.  The avalanche debris deposits are 20 to 200 feet in depth.  The climate is characterized by warm, moist summers and cold, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 90 to 110 inches including snowfall.  Average January temperature is 28 degrees F., average July temperature is 6l degrees F.; and the average annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The growing season is 125 to 175 days."
