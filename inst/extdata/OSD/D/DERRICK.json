(0 to 4 inches thick).\n2Ck--17 to 60 inches; very gravelly sand. Some visible carbonate occurring as coatings on rock fragments; 40 percent pebbles, 20 percent cobble; most of the rock fragments and a high proportion of the sand are dark fragments of basalt, and this horizon has a dark gray cast on exposure."

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  mean annual soil temperature ranges 42 degrees to 45 degrees F. Mean summer soil temperature ranges 60 degrees\nto 64 degrees F. Depth to uniformly calcareous material normally ranges from 6 to 20 inches and extends less than 2 inches into the Bt horizon.  Depth to the sandy-skeletal 2C horizon and depth to base of the argillic horizon range from 11 to 20 inches. Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate ranges from 8 to 30 inches, but these horizons are not strong enough to qualify as calcic or gypsic horizons. Mottling within the control section not due to segregation of lime ranges from no mottling to a few faint mottles with chroma of more than 2. Rock fragments are mainly 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter. The solum and C horizons when present, above the 2C horizon are uniform with only minor stratification.\nThe A horizon has hue from 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma from 1 through 4. It is neutral or mildly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6. It is typically loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 55 percent silt, and 20 to 55 percent sand with less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand. This horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR. It is gravelly to extremely gravelly sand or loamy sand. This horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye) and contains 3 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth fraction."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Derrick soils are on alluvial fans and valley side slopes. Slopes typically range from 0 to about 10 percent. These soils formed in moderately thin, calcareous, gravelly, medium to moderately fine textured alluvium overlying beds of gravelly or very gravelly coarse-textured alluvium. The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months. Mean annual temperature is 40 degrees to 43 degrees F, and mean summer temperature is 59 degrees to 63 degrees F."
