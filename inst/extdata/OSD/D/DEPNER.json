Since most of the control section is dominated by medial-skeletal material and no contrasting particle size is available for use; will call medial-skeletal.\nAndic properties data definitions:\nP-ret: phosphate retention of the less than 2mm fraction.\nB.D.: bulk density of the less than 2mm fraction on an oven dry basis.\npH NaF: pH of soil mixed with saturated sodium floride solution.\nGlass: percent volcanic glass.\nAlo: acid-oxalate-extractable aluminum of the less than 2mm fraction.\nFeo: acid-oxalate-extractable iron of the less than 2mm fraction.\n15 bar H20: dried 1500 kPa water retention as a percent.\nData elements with a * are estimated.\nNC: not calculated.\nND: not done.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This pedon was sampled by UCD Soil Morphology Laboratory in 1986.
