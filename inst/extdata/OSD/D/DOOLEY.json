  "OVERVIEW": "The Dooley series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or eolian material 20 to 40 inches deep over glacial till or lacustrine deposits.  These soils are on uplands and lacustrine areas.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
