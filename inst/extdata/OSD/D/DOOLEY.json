These soils formed in alluvium or eolian material 20 to 40 inches deep over glacial till or lacustrine deposits.  The climate is cool with long cold winters, moist springs, and warm dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, most of which falls during spring and early in summer.  Mean annual temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 100 to 135 days."
