  "OVERVIEW": "The Drum series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from lacustrine deposits.  Drum soils are on lake plains, basin floors, remnant stream terraces, and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The climate is arid, the mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F., the mean summer temperature ranges from 70 to 73 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 110 to 140 days.  Average annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches."

    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: The zone from soil surface to 6 inches. (A horizon)\nCalcic horizon: The zone from 6 to 20 inches. (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)\nThe active cation exchange activity class was added to the taxonomic classification in December 2002 based on soil property data.\nIn Utah this series is correlated with Desert range sites.\nThe taxonomic classification was changed from Typic Calciorthids to Aquic Haplocalcids in September 1994.  The Aquic Haplocalcids subgroup placement is based on mottling at 29 inches, the plant list, and being moderately well drained.  The drainage class and saturation need to be verified.  This placement should be considered tentative. This reclassification was rescinded on 10/31/2007 after review of the data populated in map units of the Drum series throughout its extent."
