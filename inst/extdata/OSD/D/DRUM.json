Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Parent materials are alluvium derived dominantly from lacustrine deposits.  The climate is arid, the mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F., the mean summer temperature ranges from 70 to 73 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 110 to 140 days.  Average annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches."

(A horizon)\nCalcic horizon: The zone from 6 to 20 inches. (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)\nThe active cation exchange activity class was added to the taxonomic classification in December 2002 based on soil property data.\nIn Utah this series is correlated with Desert range sites.\nThe taxonomic classification was changed from Typic Calciorthids to Aquic Haplocalcids in September 1994.  The Aquic Haplocalcids subgroup placement is based on mottling at 29 inches, the plant list, and being moderately well drained.  The drainage class and saturation need to be verified.  This placement should be considered tentative. This reclassification was rescinded on 10/31/2007 after review of the data populated in map units of the Drum series throughout its extent.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
