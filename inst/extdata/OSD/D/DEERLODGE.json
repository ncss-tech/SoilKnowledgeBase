    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arbidge, Dacker, Ditchcamp, Drysel, Exel, Hager, Idow, Lojet, Rakane, Snowmore, Wako, Wellsed, and Wendell series.\nArbidge soils have hue of 10YR and do not have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon.  Dacker soils have significant content of volcanic glass in the A horizons and have texture of silt loam or silty clay loam in the argillic horizon.  Ditchcamp soils are slightly acid or neutral and have thin duripans over lithic contacts at depths of 64 to 100 cm.  Drysel soils have texture of silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam in the upper part of the argillic horizon and have identifiable secondary carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Exel soils are slightly acid or neutral and do not have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates below the argillic horizon.  Hager soils have lithic contacts at depths of 100 to 152 cm.  Idow soils have hue of 10YR and average less than 5 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Lojet soils have calcic horizons in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Rakane soils have hue of 10YR in the argillic horizon and do not have Bkq horizons between the argillic horizon and the duripan.  Snowmore soils have hue of 10YR in the argillic horizon, have significant volcanic glass in the A horizons, and have lithic contacts at depths of 53 to 100 cm.  Wako soils have E horizons, have hue of 10YR in the argillic horizon, and have lithic contacts at depths of 100 to 152 cm.  Wellsed soils have the base of the argillic horizon at depths of 25 to 48 cm.  Wendell soils average 18 to 26 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have lithic contacts at depths of 66 to 97 cm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Deerlodge soils are on fan remnants and high stream terraces.  They formed in alluvium derived primarily from igneous rocks and limestone with surficial eolian deposits containing some volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,555 to 2,042 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."

Garbo soils are very deep and have calcic horizons and durinodes.  Monox soils are very deep, fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, have calcic horizons, and have brittle horizons with accumulations of opaline silica."
