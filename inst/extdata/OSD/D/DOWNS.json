  "OVERVIEW": "The Downs series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess. These soils are on interfluves and side slopes on uplands and on treads and risers on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 800 millimeters.",
