  "OVERVIEW": "The Danielvil series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, and outwash plains. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
