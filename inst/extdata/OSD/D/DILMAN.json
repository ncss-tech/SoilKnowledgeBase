  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dilman soils are on flood plains and narrow swales.  These soils formed in stratified alluvium derived mainly from tuff, diatomite, and pumiceous volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Elevations range from 4,100 to 4,400 feet.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 59 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."

Yonna soils are loamy over ashy or ashy-pumiceous but are also aniso wit loamy material below the ash but above 40 inches.  Ontko soils are fine-loamy."
