  "OVERVIEW": "The Dilman series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in stratified alluvium derived mainly from tuff, diatomite, and volcanic ash.  Dilman soils are on flood plains and narrow swales.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
