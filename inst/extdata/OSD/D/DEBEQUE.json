    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 62 to 67 degrees F.  Debeque soils are usually dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 15 consecutive days during the month of June.  The particle-size control section has 40 to 70 percent rock fragments and is very channery sandy loam or very channery loam.  Clay content ranges from 10 to 25 percent.  Lime is at a depth of 0 to 4 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick.  Bk horizons are present in some pedons.  Hue is 10YR or 2.5Y.\nThe A and AC horizons have value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Rock fragments range from 40 to 50 percent by volume.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Rock fragments range from 40 to 70 percent by volume."

The Kutler soils have a paralithic contact of grus at 20 to 40 inches.  The Baahish soils have a calcic horizon.  In addition, the Baahish soils have a Bw horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Debeque soils are on toe slopes, alluvial fans, low stream terraces and in narrow valleys.  Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived dominantly from the Green River shale formation.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 46 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 85 to 110 days.  Elevation is 5,800 to 7,500 feet.  Peak precipitation occurs once during March and April and again in September and October with June being the driest period of time."
