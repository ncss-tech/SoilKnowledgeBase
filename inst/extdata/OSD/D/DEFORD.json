  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to carbonates ranges from 25 to greater than 60 inches. Mean annual soil temperature is 39 to 47 degrees F. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout.  Texture within the particle-size control section includes fine sand, loamy fine sand, sand or loamy sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry; and chroma of 0 to 2, moist or dry. Texture is fine sand, sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or the mucky analogs of these textures. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a surface layer of muck that is as much as 8 inches thick.\nSome pedons have an Eg horizon.\nSome pedons have a Bg, Bw, or BCg horizon with weak structure above the C horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or loamy sand. Some pedons have black organic stains or streaks in the C horizon. Content of very coarse and coarse sand is 0 to 15 percent. Content of fine sand is 15 to 90 percent. Some pedons have thin layers of silt or very fine sand below 40 inches. Cobbles range from 0 to 3 percent. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bantry, Betsy Bay, Gunbarrel, Minnewaukan, and Spidercreek series. Bantry soils are in areas receiving from 16 to 20 inches of mean annual precipitation, and have colder temperatures. Betsy Bay soils have a lithic contact between 40 and 60 inches. Gunbarrel soils are moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline in the upper part of the control section. Minnewaukan soils have free carbonates above 25 inches. Spidercreek soils have greater than 15 percent very coarse and coarse sand and less than 15 percent fine sand in the C horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Deford soils are on flats or in depressions of outwash plains, lake plains, stream terraces and deltas. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits. Elevations are 600 to 1,000 feet. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F. The frost free period is 100 to 140 days."

The somewhat poorly drained Au Gres and Wainola soils and the well drained Rousseau soils are in a drainage sequence with Deford soils. Burleigh, Roscommon and Wakeley soils are associated on some lake plains."

The representative depth to wet soil moisture status is at the surface to one foot below the surface at times during the period from September to June. The representative depth of ponding is from 0.2 to 0.5 foot at some time during the period from October to June. Surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. Flooded and drained phases are recognized."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in forest, permanent pasture, or are idle. Only a small part is cultivated. The principal crops are small grain and hay. Some corn is also grown. The native vegetation was alder, quaking aspen, balsam fir, northern whitecedar, and red maple."
