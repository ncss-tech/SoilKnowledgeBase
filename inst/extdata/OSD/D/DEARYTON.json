  "OVERVIEW": "The Dearyton series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on foothills and uplands.  They formed in material weathered from saprolitic gneiss, quartzite, sedimentary lithologies of the Latah formation, and glacial till, mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The Stevens County modal pedon describes Douglas-fir, western larch, lodgepole pine and grand fir in the potential native vegetation which indicates a frigid soil temperature regime.\nDearyton soils should be further investigated to determine typical mineralogy (isotic vs. mixed).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
