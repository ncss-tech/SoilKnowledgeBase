    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dearyton soils are on foothills and uplands at elevations of 1900 to 3000 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. These soils formed in material weathered from saprolitic gneiss, quartzite, and Latah formation and glacial till, mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part.  The climate is characterized by warm, relatively dry summers and cool, moist winters. The average annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches.  The average annual air temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F.  The frost free season is 100 to 135 days."

Freeman soils are on loess uplands and are fine-silty.  Glenrose soils are on loess uplands and foothills, are fine-loamy, and have mollic epipedons.  Skalan soils are on foothills, are loamy skeletal, and are moderately deep to a lithic contact."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 12 inches (Oi, A, and BE horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 12 to 60 inches (2Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, and 2Bt5)\nVitrandic feature - the zone from 1 to 12 inches (A and BE horizons)\nUltic feature - the zone from 12 to 32 inches having base saturation by sum of cations of less than 75 percent in one or more horizon\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 12 to 32 inches (2Bt1, 2Bt2 and part of the 2Bt3 horizons)\nThe discontinuity in the 2Bt1 horizon represents the where the influence of the saprolitic gneiss, quartzite, Latah formation, and glacial till influence the soil morphology.\nDearyton soils are also mapped in Stevens County, WA, and will need to be further investigated for soil temperature regime as reflected by the local vegetation.  The Stevens County modal pedon describes Douglas-fir, western larch, lodgepole pine and grand fir in the potential native vegetation which indicates a frigid soil temperature regime.\nDearyton soils should be further investigated to determine typical mineralogy (isotic vs. mixed).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
