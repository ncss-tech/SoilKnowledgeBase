Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in till derived mainly from a mixture of quartzite, sandstone and shale.  Mean annual temperature is 35 to 40 F, mean summer temperature is 50 to 58 degrees F, and the freeze-free period is 20 to 60 days.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 35 inches and falls mostly as snow in late autumn, winter and early spring."
