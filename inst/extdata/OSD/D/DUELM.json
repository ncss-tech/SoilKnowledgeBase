  "OVERVIEW": "The Duelm series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy glacial outwash on outwash plains, stream terraces, and valley trains. These soils have slopes of 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 750 mm.",

The series control section averages less than 10 percent rock fragments, but some pedons have strata with as much as 15 percent rock fragments. The series control section has less than 40 percent fine sand and 25 to 75 percent medium sand or coarser. The mollic epipedon thickness ranges from 25 to 50 cm.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or coarse sand. It is neutral to moderately acid.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Textures and reaction are similar to the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. A Bg horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. The B horizons typically have faint to prominent Fe depletions in some parts. They are coarse sand, sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand. They range from neutral to strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is coarse sand or sand.  It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline."

Hecla soils do not have a B horizon, are dominated by fine sand, and have more than 75 percent passing the No. 40 sieve in the series control section. Osakis soils have carbonates above a depth of 64 cm and have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower third of the series control section.  Radium soils average more than 10 percent rock fragments in the series control section. Walum soils have formed in materials containing more than 50 percent shale fragments of sand size."
