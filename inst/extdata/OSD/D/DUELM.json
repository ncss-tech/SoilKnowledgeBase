  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to free carbonates ranges from 102 to over 203 cm. The series control section averages less than 10 percent rock fragments, but some pedons have strata with as much as 15 percent rock fragments. The series control section has less than 40 percent fine sand and 25 to 75 percent medium sand or coarser. The mollic epipedon thickness ranges from 25 to 50 cm.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or coarse sand. It is neutral to moderately acid.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Textures and reaction are similar to the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. A Bg horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. The B horizons typically have faint to prominent Fe depletions in some parts. They are coarse sand, sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand. They range from neutral to strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is coarse sand or sand.  It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline."

Flaming soils have more than 40 percent fine sand and more than 75 percent passing the No. 40 sieve in the series control section. Hecla soils do not have a B horizon, are dominated by fine sand, and have more than 75 percent passing the No. 40 sieve in the series control section. Osakis soils have carbonates above a depth of 64 cm and have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower third of the series control section.  Radium soils average more than 10 percent rock fragments in the series control section. Walum soils have formed in materials containing more than 50 percent shale fragments of sand size."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slope gradients are 0 to 3 percent. The soil formed in Des Moines lobe sandy outwash sediments of Late Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 3 to 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 635 to 865 mm. Frost-free days range from 120 to 180. Elevation above sea level ranges from 245 to 455 meters."

The Hubbard soils are excessively drained and occupy higher landscape positions. The somewhat poorly drained Glendorado soils and the poorly and very poorly drained Isan soils are on lower landscape positions than the Duelm soils."
