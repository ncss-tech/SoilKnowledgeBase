  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The soils are principally on steep and very steep northerly mountain slopes at elevations of 4,000 to 8,000 feet. Most slopes are between about 30 and 50 percent, but the slopes range from 10 to 80 percent. The soils formed in material weathered from basalt and other closely related volcanic rocks. The climate is cool subhumid and has an average annual precipitation of 18 to 25 inches, including 8 to 12 feet of snowfall. Average annual temperature is 35 to 41 degrees F. Frost-free season is about 60 to 80 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Elkcreek, Gaib and Klicker soils. Elkcreek soils are moderately deep and occur on shoulders and south-facing slopes. Gaib soils have basalt bedrock at depths of less than 20 inches and are on ridges. Klicker soils are skeletal and have a cryic soil temperature regime and are on landscape positions similar to Demast soils."
