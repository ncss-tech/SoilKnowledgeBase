  "OVERVIEW": "The Demast series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes. They formed in material weathered mainly from basalt and other closely related volcanic rocks. Permeability is moderately slow. Slopes are 10 to 80 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

Most slopes are between about 30 and 50 percent, but the slopes range from 10 to 80 percent. The soils formed in material weathered from basalt and other closely related volcanic rocks. The climate is cool subhumid and has an average annual precipitation of 18 to 25 inches, including 8 to 12 feet of snowfall. Average annual temperature is 35 to 41 degrees F. Frost-free season is about 60 to 80 days."
