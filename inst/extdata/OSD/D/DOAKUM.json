  "OVERVIEW": "The Doakum series consists of deep and very deep, well drained moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium, fan alluvium, stream alluvium and eolian materials derived dominantly from shale and sandstone. Doakum soils are on mesas, plateaus, cuestas, fan remnants, fan terraces, hills and ridges. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

A later revision to Soil Taxonomy combined these into one Ustic subgroup resulting in duplication of series differentia and inconsistent field mapping.  Surface organic matter content has been better defined as differentia but the Doakum series may need to be inactivated if concept confusion persists after 7/2007"
