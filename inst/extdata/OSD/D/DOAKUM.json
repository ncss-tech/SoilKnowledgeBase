Balon soils are noneffervescent throughout.  Blancot and Yenlo soils have hue of 10YR and 2.5Y.  Bowbac, Cambria, Cushman, Delconey, Forkwood, Hiland, Pokeman, Potts, Pugsley, Spangler and Teckla soils are moist in May and June.  Buckle, Oelop and Palacid soils contain less than 40 percent sand.  Penistaja soils average more than 1 percent organic matter in the surface 16 inches.  Quagwa soils contain less than 25 percent sand.  Cerropelon, Cumacho, Gaddes, Gapmesa and Hagerman soils have bedrock at moderate depths.  Chilerojo, Fort, Olney, Sundance and Tamarindo soils attempt to reflect the effects of soil forming agents unique to the Great Plains.  Redpen soils have 2.5YR hue.  Mentmore soils have 2.5Y hue.  Chilojo and Hagerwest soils are Inactive."

The soils formed in alluvium, fan alluvium, stream alluvium and eolian material derived dominantly from shale and sandstone. Elevations range from 6,000 to 7,200 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 14 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 53 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."

A later revision to Soil Taxonomy combined these into one Ustic subgroup resulting in duplication of series differentia and inconsistent field mapping.  Surface organic matter content has been better defined as differentia but the Doakum series may need to be inactivated if concept confusion persists after 7/2007\nADDITIONAL DATA: Reference data for one pedon from San Juan Co. NM is available as S86NM-045-17.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
