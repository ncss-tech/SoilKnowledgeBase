  "OVERVIEW": "The Drage series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed igneous and metamorphic rock.  Drage soils are on alluvial fans and hills and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

The soil formed in alluvium from mixed igneous and sedimentary rocks with an influence of loess in some areas.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches, most of which falls as snow or early spring rain.  The average annual temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 60 to 90 days."

Little Wood soils have a base saturation of 50 to 75 percent in some part above 75 cm.  Molyneux soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Vitale soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches and are on south- and west-facing mountainsides.  Molyneux soils are on similar landscapes as are Drage soils.  Little Wood soils occur on stream terraces."
