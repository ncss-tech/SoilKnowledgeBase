These soils are formed in colluvium and residuum from shale, argillite, quartzite and other similar sedimentary rocks. The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 305 to 405 mm. The mean annual air temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 90 to 130 days."
