Introductory paragraph: revised. Typical pedon: revised to better match SSL data. RICs: revised, Bk and Cg horizons: Textures: added clay loam and sandy clay loam. Geographic Setting through Distribution and Extent: revised. Geographically Associated Soils: Deleted Dunday and Ipage, added Cullison, Nenzel, and Ord. Additional Data: revised.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data is available from the National Soil Survey Center, Soil Survey Laboratory for Pedon ID 86NE031096. Pedon ID 86NE031096 represents the Typical Pedon and it also has data from the Nebraska Department of Roads.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
