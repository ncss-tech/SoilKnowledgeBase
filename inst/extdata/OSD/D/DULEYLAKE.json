    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 49 to 51 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 15 to 20 inches thick.  The particle-size control section is 25 to 30 percent clay and less than 10 percent coarse fragments.  Depth to the seasonal high water table in spring is 2.0 to 3.0 feet.  These soils are saturated at 2 to 3 feet for 90 to 120 days in most years.  Depth to mottles with chroma of 2 or less is 25 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is loam or sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry or moist.  It is loam or clay loam.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  Mottles range from common fine distinct to many medium prominent.  It is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Elevations range from 2,200 to 2,700 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers, and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 71 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 110 to 150 days."
