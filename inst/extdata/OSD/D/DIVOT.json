    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for cropland and rangeland.  Cropland is used mainly for crops such as grain sorghum, small grain, and introduced grasses under both dryland and irrigated operations. Some corn, cotton, and truck crops are also grown under irrigation.  The native vegetation consists of about 15 percent trees and other woody plants such as elm, hackberry, pecan, liveoak and a few large mesquite trees with an understory of predominantly mid grasses.  With retrogression, woody shrubs and short grasses increase or invade.  Typical increasers and invaders are curlymesquite, Hall's panicum, threeawn, whitebrush, Texas persimmon, condalias, spiny hackberry, and annual forbs."
