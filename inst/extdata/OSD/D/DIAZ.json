  "OVERVIEW": "The Diaz series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt, tuff, or andesite.  Diaz soils are on lava plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
