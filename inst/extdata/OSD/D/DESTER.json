The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 when dry.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand with 0 to 20 percent gravel and 5 to 15 percent clay.  Phosphate retention is 15 to 25 percent.  Glass and glass-coated aggregate is 40 to 60 percent.  Acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate extractable iron is 0.3 to 0.6 percent.\nThe 2Bt horizon has chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  It is gravelly clay loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  It has 27 to 35 percent average clay and 0 to 25 percent gravel."

The soils formed in ash over sediment weathered from lava rocks.  The climate is characterized by cold moist winters and warm dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The classification was changed from fine-loamy, mixed, frigid Xerollic Durargids to fine-loamy, mixed, frigid Vitritorrandic Argixerolls in 1992, to reflect the presence of andic soil characteristics in the upper part and the lack of the consistent presence of a duripan.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - from 0 to 17 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - from 17 to 34 inches (2Bt1, 2Bt2 horizons)\nVitritorrandic subgroup - the upper 17 inches of the profile (A horizon) fails andic soil properties because phosphate retention is less than 25 percent.  Data is based on analysis from the geographically associated Borobey, Stookmoor, Milican, and Gardone Soils.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
