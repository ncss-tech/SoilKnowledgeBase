The particle-size control section averages 15 to 27 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 35 to 60 percent coarse fragments by volume.  Organic matter is estimated to range from 0.5 to 1 percent.  Solum thickness and depth to a lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe BA horizon is very gravelly loam or very cobbly loam.\nThe Bt horizons have chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  They are very gravelly loam or very gravelly loam.  They are neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizons have a value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4, dry or moist.  They are extremely cobbly loam, very gravelly loam, or extremely gravelly loam. They are slightly or moderately alkaline."

Hefed soils have sandy loam or loamy sand textures with 40 to 60 percent rock fragments below the Bt horizon.  Hunewill soils have extremely gravelly or cobbly sand below the Bt horizon.  Jungo soils are very deep and have secondary carbonates 4 to 8 inches below the surface. Lithgow soils have a Bt horizon with 27 to 35 percent clay."

These soils occur in an arid climate with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 9 inches.  The average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The average January temperature is about 29 degrees F.; the average July temperature is about 71 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 135 to 195 days."
