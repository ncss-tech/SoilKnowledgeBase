Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Horizons with color value less than 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist extend to depths of 20 to 50 inches, but the organic carbon content at depths greater than 20 inches is less than .60 percent. These soils typically lack free carbonates throughout but some pedons have carbonates between depths of 40 and 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is a loamy fine sand or loamy sand but locally is fine sand where winnowing has occurred.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or fine sand.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or fine sand.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline."

Dunday, Forestburg, and Vetal soils are on landscapes similar to those of the Doger soils.  Forestburg soils have loamy sediments between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  Vetal soils are coarse-loamy and have a mollic epipedon thicker than 20 inches.  Duda and Valentine soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are on higher portions of the landscape.  In addition, Duda soils have sandstone bedrock between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  Elsmere soils have mottles in the control section, have a water table, and are on lower parts of the landscape.  Gannett and Loup soils are in drainageways and have a high water table.  Shue soils have glacial till between depths of 20 to 40 inches, are wetter, and are in swales.  Tassel soils have sandstone bedrock above depths of 20 inches and are on steeper and higher parts of the landscape."
