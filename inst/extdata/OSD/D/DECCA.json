  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Decca series consists of very deep, well drained moderately permeable soils.  These soils formed in stratified mixed alluvium derived mainly from igneous rocks and quartzite on fan remnants, stream terraces and rolling hills.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
