  "OVERVIEW": "The Dacore series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from andesite, dacite, basalt, and tuff. Dacore soils occur on coalescent alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 275 mm (11 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",

(Bt and Btk horizons)\nMollic epipedon: The zone from the surface of the soil to 15 inches (38 cm.) (A, Bt, Btk horizons)\nArgillic horizon: The zone from 4 to 15 inches (10 to 38 cm.) (Bt, Btk horizons)\nCalcic horizon: The zone from 15 to 38 inches (38 to 97 cm.) (Bk horizons)\nThe concept for this series has been narrowed to the Utah semidesert zone at about 8 to 12 inches (200 to 300 mm) of precipitation.  Previously, the Utah upland zone at greater than 12 inches (300 mm) of precipitation was included. The moisture regime is aridic bordering ustic consistent with the native vegetation and conceptual break, but is influenced by considerable winter moisture as well.\nThe cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data from similar soils in the soil survey area.\nTaxonomic version:  Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
