Atmore soils are on similar positions and have coarse-loamy control sections.  Bibb soils are on slightly lower flood plain positions, contain less than 5 percent, by volume, plinthite in the control section and are less developed. Daleville soils are on similar positions and have less than 5 percent, by volume, plinthite in the subsoil. The moderately well or well drained Malbis soils are on higher adjacent positions.  The somewhat poorly drained Robertsdale soils are on slightly higher positions. The moderately well drained Savannah soils are on adjacent higher positions and have brittle subsoils."
