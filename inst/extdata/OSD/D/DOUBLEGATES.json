  "OVERVIEW": "The Doublegates series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils along drainageways and in depressions.  They formed in thick loamy marine and alluvial sediments of the Southern Coastal Plain.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.",
