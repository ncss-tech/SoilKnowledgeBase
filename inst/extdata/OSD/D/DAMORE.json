Depth to the 2Bk horizon and\nsecondary carbonates is 20 to 40 inches.  The soil is dry\nfor 60 to 90 consecutive days in the four months following\nthe summer solstice.  The lower part of the subsoil is\nslightly to violently effervescent.  The particle-size\ncontrol section is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay and\naverages 35 to 60 percent clay.\nThe A1 horizon is high in organic matter and has a moist\nbulk density of 1.00 to 1.30 in the surface horizon.  It has\nvalue of 2 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2.\nStructure is moderate granular or subangular blocky.\nThe A2 horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and\nchroma of 2 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam, averaging\n30 to 35 percent clay.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and\nchroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or\nsilty clay, with 35 to 45 percent clay.  It has few to\ncommon faint or distinct mottles.\nThe 2Bk horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and\nchroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay or clay,\nwith 40 to 50 percent clay.  It has common to many distinct\nor prominent mottles and may be gleyed.  Soil reaction\nranges from mildly to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR.  It has value of 4\nor 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.\nIt is silty clay, clay or gravelly clay, with 40 to 60\npercent clay.  Coarse fragments range from 10 to 20 percent\ngravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  The upper part of this\nhorizon may be strongly to violently effervescent, with the\nlime disseminated throughout."

The mean\nannual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free\nperiod is 50 to 90 days.  This soil occurs on the Winkle\ngeomorphic surface."
