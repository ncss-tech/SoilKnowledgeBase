    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Lynndyl (UT), Sandbench (UT), and Tohatin (AZ) series. Lynndyl soils have mean annual soil temperature less than 54 degrees F. In addition, Lynndyl soils are in the Great Basin Desert (MLRA 28A) and have precipitation more evenly distributed throughout the year. Sandbench soils are moderately deep to hard bedrock. Tohatin soils have hues of 5YR and depth to calcic horizon 2 to 6 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Denazar soils are on eolian-mantled summits of plateaus and structural benches, and treads of high stream terraces. Denazar soils formed in eolian material, alluvium, and residuum derived from sandstone. The lower part of some profiles formed in weathered sandstone over a base of interbedded soft and hard sandstone. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 5,900 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 10 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high intensity thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 140 to 180 days."

Nageezi soils are coarse-loamy and occur on adjacent treads of high stream terraces which have thinner eolian mantles."
