  "OVERVIEW": "The Denazar series consists of deep and very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian material, alluvium, and residuum derived from sandstone. Permeability is rapid or moderately rapid. Denazar soils are on eolian-mantled summits of plateaus and structural benches, and on treads of high stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
