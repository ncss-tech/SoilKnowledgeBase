  "OVERVIEW": "The Delphos series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils. These soils formed in loamy calcareous eolian sediments in the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. Delphos soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains in broad, shallow basins or draws. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in), and mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C. (61 degrees F).",
