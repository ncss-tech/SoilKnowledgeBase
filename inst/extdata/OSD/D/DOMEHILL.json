    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Badrock, Farepeak, Hardnut, Hardteph, and Schoolmarm series.\nBadrock and Hardnut soils have lithic contacts within 36 to 50 cm of the soil surface.  Farepeak and Schoolmarm soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July through September due to convection storms. Hardteph have 60 to 85 percent rock fragments. Mattier soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 5.5 to 7 degrees C."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Domehill soils are on mountains and plateaus.  They typically occur on summit, backslope or shoulder positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite and  tuff-breccia with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1.955 to 3,115 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 500 mm, the mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 70 days."
