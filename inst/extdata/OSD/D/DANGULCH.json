  "OVERVIEW": "The Dangulch series consists of deep, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in colluvium from lacustrine deposits. Slopes range from 25 to 50 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
