    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid. Rock fragments are mostly channers and range from 5 through 30 percent in the A horizon, 5 through 40 percent in the Bw horizon, and 10 through 50 in the C horizon, but average less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 3. Dry value is 6 or more in horizons that are more than 7 inches thick. It is loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon.\nSome pedons have a thin Bs horizon or a thin BC horizon.\nThe upper part of the Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6. The lower part of the Bw horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. The Bw horizon is loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 4. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bice, Elka, Flatiron, Haights, Lombard, Millsite, and Mongaup series. Bice soils have rock fragments that are primarily granite and gneiss. Elka soils have redder hue and have rock fragments that are primarily sandstone, siltstone, and conglomerate. Haights soils formed in alluvium or outwash material. Lombard soils are moderately deep to saprolite. Millsite soils are moderately deep to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dummerston soils are on glaciated uplands. They are on hill tops, ridge tops, shoulders, and back slopes. Slope ranges from 3 to 70 percent. The soils formed in loamy till of Wisconsin age that is derived mainly from phyllite, slate, schist, shale, or interbedded phyllite and limestone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to more than 50 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F. The frost free season ranges from 90 to 135 days."

The moderately deep Macomber, the shallow Taconic, and the very shallow Hubbardton soils are in slightly higher positions on the landscape than the Dummerston soils. The well drained Lanesboro soils are in the same landscape position as Dummerston soils and are moderately deep to a densic contact. The moderately well drained Buckland and Fullam soils are on back slopes and foot slopes. The poorly drained Brayton soils are on toeslopes and depressions."
