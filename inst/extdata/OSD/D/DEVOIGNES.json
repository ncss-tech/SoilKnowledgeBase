  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  DeVoignes soils are in depressions and swales of flood plains, drainageways and valley floors.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in mixed alluvium that is stratified with organic layers in the upper part.  Elevations range from 1,750 to 2,800 feet.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches.  The average frost-free period is 90 to 140 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bellslake, Farnhamton, Pywell, Ritz, and Schnoorson soils. Bellslake soils are on floodplains and do not have a histic epipedon (organic materials are below 35 inches).  Farnhamton soils are on natural levees on flood plains, are coarse-silty and are moderately well drained.  Pywell soils are in depressions on floodplains and have organic material to a depth of 40 inches or more. Ritz soils are on low stream terraces and flood plains and are coarse-silty.  Schnoorson soils are on depressions and swales on flood plains and do not have organic horizons."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; very slow runoff; saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.  Most of these soils have been artificially drained.  These soils are subject to frequent flooding for very long periods from December to June unless protected by levees.  Protected areas are subject to rare or occasional flooding."

Some areas are used for wetlands, wildlife habitat and recreation. Natural vegetation is mainly Pacific willow, cattails, sedges, rushes, thinleaf alder, pyramid spirea, and Douglas hawthorne."
