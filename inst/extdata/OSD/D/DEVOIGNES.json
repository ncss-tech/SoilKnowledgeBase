  "OVERVIEW": "The DeVoignes series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils in depressions and swales on flood plains, drainageways and valley floors.  They formed in mixed alluvium that is stratified with organic layers in the upper part.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 22 inches.",

Bellslake soils are on floodplains and do not have a histic epipedon (organic materials are below 35 inches).  Farnhamton soils are on natural levees on flood plains, are coarse-silty and are moderately well drained.  Pywell soils are in depressions on floodplains and have organic material to a depth of 40 inches or more. Ritz soils are on low stream terraces and flood plains and are coarse-silty.  Schnoorson soils are on depressions and swales on flood plains and do not have organic horizons."

Devoignes soils in Benewah County are formed from noncalcareous parent material.\nThe 10/2013 revision reflects a change in drainage class from poorly drained to very poorly drained based on the type location description."
