  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the control section is 51 inches and depth to loamy material ranges from 18 to 50 inches.  Sodium content of the mineral horizon ranges from 8 to 25 percent or more.\nThe O horizons have color with hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, or neutral, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 2.  The organic materials are dominantly sapric material that are derived mainly from herbaceous fiber.  Most pedons have layers, particularly surface layers, that are hemic or fibric materials but their accumulative thickness is less than one half the total thickness of the organic material.  Though the upper 32 inches is dominantly organic materials, some pedons have loamy or clayey mineral layers in this section with an accumulative thickness of up to 15 inches.  The organic materials are moderately acid to slightly alkaline but become extremely acid (pH 4.0) or very strongly acid if drained.\nThe A horizon has color with hue 10YR to 5Y, or neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1.  Texture is mucky silt loam, mucky silty clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline but becomes very strongly acid if drained.\nThe C or B horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have subhorizons with up to 10 percent calcium carbonate nodules."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Allemands, Belhaven, Carlin, Kenner, Lafitte, Mattamuskeet, Maurepas, Pamlico, Ponzer, and Tomoka series.  Allemands soils have clayey textures.  Belhaven, Ponzer, and Tomoka soils are more acid throughout.  Carlin, Kenner, Lafitte, and Maurepas soils have more than 50 inches of organic materials.  Mattamuskeet and Pamlico soils have sandy textures."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Delcomb soils are on low level brackish marshlands at elevations slightly above sea level.  The water level is at or above the surface most of the time.  These soils are subject to tidal action and are frequently flooded with slightly saline water.  Slope gradients are less than 1 percent.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual temperature near the type location is about 68 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 60 inches."
