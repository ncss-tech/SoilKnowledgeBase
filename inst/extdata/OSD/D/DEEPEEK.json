  "OVERVIEW": "The Deepeek series consists of shallow over duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Deepeek soils are on fan piedmont remnants, hills and plateaus.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
