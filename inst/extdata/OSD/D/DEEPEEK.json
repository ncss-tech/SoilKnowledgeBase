  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Deepeek soils are on hills, plateaus and fan piedmont remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with some influence from loess and colluvium.  Slopes are from 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,465 to 1,740 meters.  Climate is cool and semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winter.  Mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
