  "OVERVIEW": "The Denhawken series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in clayey material weathered from shale. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on hillslopes on inland dissected coastal plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 885 mm (35 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).",
