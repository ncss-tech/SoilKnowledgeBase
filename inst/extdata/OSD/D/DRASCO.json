  "OVERVIEW": "The Drasco series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess and material weathered from basalt. Drasco soils are on benches, canyon side slopes, and plateaus and have slopes of 3 to 35 percent. Permeability is slow. Average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
