  "OVERVIEW": "The Darr series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, soils formed in loamy alluvium over sand and gravel on flood plains.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately rapid above the alluvium and rapid or very rapid in the sand and gravel.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 600 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
