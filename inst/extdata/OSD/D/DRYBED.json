Benwy soils have a duripan at a depth of 40 to 60 inches and secondary carbonates at a depth of 24 to 38 inches.  Bidwell soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 48 to 50 degrees F. and secondary carbonates at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Brogan soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 49 to 51 degrees F. and lacustrine sediments at a depth of 25 to 40 inches.  Caliralls soils have 15 to 25 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and a depth of 25 to 43 inches to secondary carbonates.  Doyce soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 49 degrees F., a Bk horizon with 5 to 35 percent rock fragments, and 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent throughout.  Haw soils are 22 to 38 inches to secondary carbonates.

The soil formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources with an influence of loess in the surface.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,200 to 3,800 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool and moist winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 160 days."
