  "OVERVIEW": "The Drybed series consists of very deep, well drained soils on stream terraces.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources with an influence of loess in the surface.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
