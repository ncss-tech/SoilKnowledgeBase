  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to free carbonates ranges from 18 to 80 inches or more. Coarse fragments of mixed lithology comprise 0 to 5 percent by volume in the A and B horizons to 0 to 15 percent in the C horizon. The content of clay decreases erratically with depth. Some pedons have an O\nhorizon as thick as 6 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 24 inches in thickness.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 2. Redox features are not present in some pedons. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam or their mucky analogs. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. Redox features are present in most subhorizons. It has distinct textural stratification. It has strata that are mostly fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, and loamy fine sand, but it has coarser or finer textured strata or both in some pedons. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Cg horizon typically has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, chroma of 1 or 2. Hues of 5GY, 5G, 5BG, and 5B are also within the range. It is coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, or loamy sand, but thin discontinuous finer textured or gravelly strata are in some pedons. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are in depressions and sluggish drainageways on glacial outwash plains, stream terraces, valley trains, and deltas. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. They formed in stratified sandy and loamy outwash sediments of Late Wisconsin Age. Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 30 inches. Frost free days range from 125 to 165. Elevations above sea level range from 600 to 1600 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lasa, Litchfield, Darfur, and Fieldon soils which are members of a hydrosequence with the Dassel soils. The Lasa soils are somewhat excessively drained and are on higher lying or more sloping terrain. The moderately well drained Litchfield soils are on nearby slightly higher lying terrain. The poorly drained Darfur and Fieldon soils are on nearby level areas. The Fieldon soils have free carbonates throughout."
