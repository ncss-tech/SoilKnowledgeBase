  "OVERVIEW": "The Dangvar series consists of shallow, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments derived from mixed volcanic rock sources with additions of volcanic ash.  Dangvar soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
