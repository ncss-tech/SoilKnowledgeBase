Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Elevations range from 4,400 to 4,600 feet. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches, mean annual temperature is 44 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."

Cumulative annual duration class is Common. The drainage in some areas has been altered due to the presence of gullies. These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods year-round; high surface runoff; very slow permeability."
