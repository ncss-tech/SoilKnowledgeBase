Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 5,290 to 5,350 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches including 10 to 20 inches of snow.  The mean January soil temperature is 36 to 39 degrees F. and the mean July soil temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 44 to 46 degrees F., the mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 80 days."
