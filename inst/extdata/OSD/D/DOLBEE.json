Some pedons have an AB horizon instead of a BA horizon.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The faces of peds in the B horizon in some pedons have values of 2 or 3.  Mottles in the B horizon most commonly have hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR. The Bg horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam that averages between 25 and 34 percent clay.\nThe BCg and C horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2 and are silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam."

Chalmers, Drummer, Maxcreek, and Maxfield soils formed in loess or silty sediments and the underlying glacial drift.  Drummer soils have C horizons that are stratified.  Maxcreek soils have carbonates in the C horizon.  Elvira soils have concentrations of iron and manganese oxides in the A and B horizons and are higher in free iron.  Garwin and Sable soils formed in loess and have a more systematic increase or decrease in silt and clay-size particles with depth.  Hartsburg, Madelia, and Pella soils have free carbonates within 40 inches of the surface.  Leshara soils have free carbonates within depths of 20 inches.  Marcus soils formed in loess and contain 36 to 42 percent clay in the upper part of the solum.  Ossian soils contain 6 to 7 percent organic matter in the A horizon, have a solum thinner than 50 inches, and typically contains little or no sand coarser than very fine sand.  The Patton series has a thinner solum and is stratified within the control section.  Rushmore formed in loess or lacustrine sediments and glacial till.  The solum and depth to carbonates are less than 36 inches, and the lower part of the control section contains coarse sand and gravel.  Wacousta soils have a solum thinner than 24 inches and free carbonates within depths of 20 inches.  Blackoar soils are stratified.  Clyde, Tripoli, and Webster soils are fine-loamy.  Sandy substratum phases are within the range of the series."
