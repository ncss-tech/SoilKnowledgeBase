  "OVERVIEW": "The Dastrup series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, silt stone and conglomerate.  Dastrup soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
