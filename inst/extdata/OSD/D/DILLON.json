  "OVERVIEW": "The Dillon series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains, flood-plain steps and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
