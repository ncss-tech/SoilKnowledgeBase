  "OVERVIEW": "The Dahlquist series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous, cobbly, and gravelly alluvium. Dahlquist soils are on fan piedmonts, fan aprons, and footslopes. Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to base of the argillic horizon is 15 to 30 inches. Depth to continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation is 10 to 24 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is about 40 to 47 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature is about 59 to 66 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It has 10 to 25 percent cobbles and 10 to 20 percent gravel. This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. The fine earth fraction is clay loam or sandy clay loam and averages 20 to 35 percent clay and more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser. Rock fragments are greater than 35 percent and are 10 to 25 percent cobbles, 10 to 35 percent gravel, and 0 to 25 percent stones. It is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. The fine earth fraction is loam or sandy loam and averages 5 to 18 percent clay. Rock fragments are greater than 35 percent and are 10 to 50 percent cobbles, 10 to 45 percent gravel, and 0 to 25 percent stones.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6. Accumulated calcium carbonate ranges from 5 to 14 percent. The upper part of this horizon is very cobbly sandy loam or loam, but it grades to extremely cobbly loamy sand or cobble and sand in the lower part. This horizon is 5 to 18 percent clay in the upper part and 0 to 5 percent in the lower part. It has 10 to 60 percent cobbles, 25 to 45 percent pebbles, and 0 to 15 percent stones. It is moderately or strongly alkaline. C horizons are common in many pedons in the lower part of the 30 to 60 inches of the profile."
