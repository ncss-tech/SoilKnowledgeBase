  "OVERVIEW": "The Dorrance series consists of excessively drained, very rapidly permeable soils formed in loamy material overlying old alluvial sandy and gravelly sediments at a depth of 10 to 24 inches.  These soils are on uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Loose loamy sand or coarser material is at depths of 10 to 24 inches.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 0 to 10 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 19 inches in thickness.  Gravel in the solum consists mainly of quartz and feldspar material with lesser amounts of limestone fragments and ranges from 5 to 35 percent by volume.  Cobbles in the solum consist only of limestone fragments and range from 0 to 5 percent by volume.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, loam, or gravelly loam.  It commonly is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline, but a few pedons are neutral in the upper part.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, loamy sand, or gravelly loamy sand.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is gravelly loamy sand, sand, gravelly sand, and coarse sand.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Gravel ranges from 2 to 50 percent by volume but averages less than 35 percent.  Limestone material makes up less than 1 percent of the coarse fragments."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Doger, Dunday, Heber, Meadin, and Pivot series in the same family and the Alwilda, Oneill, Orton, and Simeon series.  Doger, Dunday, Meadin, Oneill, Pivot, and Simeon soils lack free carbonates to a depth of 40 inches.  Heber soils are at elevations of 6,000 feet or more.  They support different kinds of native vegetation, have a frost-free season of less than 140 days, and have less than 16 percent coarse fragments.  Alwilda soils have a cambic horizon and are noncalcareous to a depth of at least 20 inches.  Orton and Oneill soils are moderately deep over sandy sediments."

The mean annual temperature ranges from 55 to 59 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 23 to 28 inches.  Thornthwaite Annual P-E Index ranges from 36 to 46."
