  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDurham soils were formerly placed in the Red-Yellow Podzolic great soil group. They ranged in texture in the B horizon from moderately-fine to fine, and in drainage from well drained to moderately well drained. This revision restricts the texture of the argillic horizon to fine-loamy and the drainage class to well drained. The 2017 version moved the type location from Wake County, North Carolina to Lee County, North Carolina. With the update to the Wake County Soil Survey, Durham soils are no longer mapped in Wake County.  The November 2025 revision corrected some of the formatting. No data was changed.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 38 centimeters (0 to 15 inches) (A and E  horizons).\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 38 to 124 centimeters (15 to 49 inches) (Bt horizons)."
