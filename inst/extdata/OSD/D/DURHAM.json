Coarse fragments range from 0 to 5 percent throughout.  The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid except where the surface has been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizons have hues of 7.5YR, 10YR, and 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It has few to common reddish, brownish, or yellowish mottles.  Mottles in chroma of 2 or less are below the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Some pedons have lower Bt horizon of sandy clay, but the textural control section averages less than 35 percent clay.\nThe BC horizon is similar in color to the Bt horizon except where the mottles are more contrasting.  It is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  The BC horizon contains weatherable minerals such as mica and feldspar.\nThe C horizon is mottled saprolite of acid crystalline rock.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Durham soils were formerly placed in the Red-Yellow Podzolic great soil group.  They ranged in texture of the B horizon from moderately-fine to fine, and in drainage from well drained to moderately well drained.  This revision restricts the texture of the argillic horizon to fine-loamy and the drainage class to well drained.  The 2017 version moved the type location from Wake County, North Carolina to Lee County, North Carolina.  With the update to the Wake County Soil Survey, Durham soils are no longer mapped in Wake County.\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nNC0070 DURHAM      0- 10   58- 65  185-240  40- 60   350- 600\nNC0123 DURHAM      0- 10   58- 65  185-240  40- 60   350- 600\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nNC0070 NONE          6.0-6.0              -     60-60\nNC0123 NONE          4.0-6.0  PERCHED  DEC-MAR  60-60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nNC0070  0-15  LCOS LS                 0-  3  90-100  2-10   1-  3\nNC0070  0-15  SL FSL                  0-  3  90-100  5-20   1-  4\nNC0070 15-33  SCL CL                  0-  3  90-100 18-35   2-  4\nNC0070 33-49  CL SC SCL               0-  3  90-100 25-45   3-  5\nNC0070 49-56  SCL SL                  0-  3  90-100  8-30   1-  4\nNC0070 56-70  LS SL SCL               0-  3  85-100  5-20   1-  3\nNC0123  0-15  LCOS LS                 0-  3  90-100  2-10   1-  3\nNC0123  0-15  SL FSL                  0-  3  90-100  5-20   1-  4\nNC0123 15-33 SCL CL                  0-  3  90-100 18-35   2-  4\nNC0123 33-49  CL SC                   0-  3  90-100 25-45   3-  5\nNC0123 49-56  SCL SL                  0-  3  90-100  8-30   1-  4\nNC0123 56-70  LS SL SCL               0-  3  85-100  5-20   1-  3\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
