  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Decker series consists of very deep somewhat poorly drained soils on nearly terraces.  They formed in alluvium from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
