  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum is 24 to 45 inches.  Depth to free carbonates (in the fine-earth fraction) is 16 to 45 inches.  Thickness of the upper mantle is 10 to 24 inches.  Coarse fragments typically are lacking in the upper part of the solum, but has as much as 10 percent in some pedons.  Coarse fragments of limestone or dolostone pebble, flagstone or cobblestone size comprise 35 to 80 percent of the 2B and 2C horizons.  Bedrock commonly begins at depths ranging from 45 to 70 inches.  These soils are near or at wilting point for as much as 1 month during July and August in some years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is strongly acid to neutral.  The A horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is strongly acid to neutral.  The E horizons are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It has a fine-earth fraction of loam or clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay.  It has common or many faint through prominent clay films on faces of peds.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It has a fine-earth fraction of sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Conotton, Hawksbill, Leoni, Lutzke and Oakhill series in the same family and the Frontenac and Nordness series.  Conotton soils formed in glacial outwash and are acid to depths of 50 inches or more.  The Hawksbill and Leoni soils lack an upper mantle that is free of coarse fragments and lack limestone bedrock within depths of 70 inches.  Frontenac soils have a fine-loamy B horizon with less than 35 percent coarse fragments and have a mollic epipedon.  Nordness soils have limestone bedrock beginning with depths of 20 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Dorerton soils have plane or convex slopes with gradient of 12 to 65 percent on sideslopes, upper backslopes and shoulders in dissected uplands.  Slopes are 50 to 600 feet in length.  Slope aspect is northwest to northeast in most broad valleys and includes southwest to southeast aspects in narrow ravines.  Relative relief is 100 to 400 feet.  These soils formed in a loamy mantle of loess and erosional sediments and in loamy-skeletal material from fragmented limestone.  This overlies sandy-skeletal material from fragmented dolostone or limestone.  Dolostone or limestone bedrock underlies this material at depths of 45 to 70 inches or more.  Mean annual precipitation is 27 to 35 inches, and mean annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F."

Brodale soils are downslope on steep and very steep south to west-facing back slopes.  They have a mollic epipedon and lack an argillic horizon.  Dubuque soils are upslope on nose and summit positions, lack coarse fragments, and have a lithic contact beginning between depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Frontenac soils are formed in a thicker loamy mantle and are downslope on foot slopes.  Marlean soils have a mollic epipedon, lack an argillic horizon, and are principally on north to east-facing back slopes.  Seaton soils are typically on summits and formed in loess."
