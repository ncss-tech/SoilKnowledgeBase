  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 30 inches.  Depth to cemented sandy concretions ranges from 12 to 16 inches, and depth to cemented sandy layers ranges from 30 to 46 inches.  The reaction ranges from neutral in the surface layer to strongly alkaline in the lower C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture ranges from sandy loam in the upper part to loamy fine sand in the lower part.  The C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 3 to 6.  Common to many strata of darker and lighter materials occur.  The percent of cemented sandy concretions in the upper C horizon range from 15 to 35 percent.  The cementation may be due to combinations of calcium carbonate, OM, and iron.  It is sand or gravelly sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Durados soils occur along the coast at elevations close to sea level, near the mouths of rivers flowing into the sea.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 2 percent.  The soil formed in coarse textured soil materials which consist of sand size shell fragments, and miscellaneous volcanic subrounded fragments.  Some unknown mechanism causes the cementation of the sand into concretions and cemented layers.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation is 70 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 76 to 80 degrees F."

The Coloso and Toa soils occur in river flood plains farther inland from the coast.  The land type Coastal beaches are on narrow sandy strips closer to the sea."
