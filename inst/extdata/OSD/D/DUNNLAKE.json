  "OVERVIEW": "The Dunnlake series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in eolian material and residuum weathered from basalt or andesite.  Dunnlake soils are on lava plateaus and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bidrim, Brezniak, Cullius, Devada, and Wylo series.\nBidrim soils have A horizons with 3 to 8 percent organic matter and have subhorizons of the argillic horizon with slickensides and 55 to 65 percent clay.  Brezniak soils are 7 to 12 inches to the lithic contact.  Cullius soils are influenced by pumiceous volcanic ash in the surface horizons.  Devada soils have an abrupt clay increase of 20 percent between the A and B horizons.  Wylo soils have mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 59 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dunnlake series are on lava plateaus and mountains.  They occur on all slope positions, but on backslope positions they are mainly on south-facing aspects.  These soils formed in eolian material and residuum weathered from basalt or andesite.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 4,100 to 4,800 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  The mean January temperature is 26 to 32 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 44 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 80 days."

Lequieu soils are loamy-skeletal, very shallow to lithic contacts, and do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons.  Rangee soils are very-fine, moderately deep to thin duripans over lithic contacts, and have an abrupt increase in clay in the argillic horizon.  Searles soils are loamy-skeletal and are moderately deep to lithic contacts."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision of February 2003 moves the type location from Lassen County to Siskiyou County, California, to a soil survey area where the series is correlated.  Although the Dunnlake series was proposed in the Susanville Area soil survey in 1985, it was eventually correlated to the competing Devada series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 10 inches (A, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 4 to 16 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 16 inches to hard, unweathered bedrock (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 4 to 16 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nClassification was updated to 11th edition on 07/2011 changed from Lithic Argixerolls to Aridic Lithic Argixerolls\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
