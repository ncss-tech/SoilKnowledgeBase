  "OVERVIEW": "The Daphnedale series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in lake deposits of basic igneous rocks, diatomite, tuff and pyroclastic materials.  Daphnedale soils are on terraces.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

These soils formed in Plio- Pleistocene lake deposits, mainly of the Alturas formation, composed of basic igneous rocks, diatomite, tuff and pyroclastic material.  Elevations are 4200 to 4800 feet.  The climate is cool semiarid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cold snowy moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 16 inches.  Average January temperature is 27 to 30 degrees F.; average July temperature is 67 to 70 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 120 days."

Ager soils are clayey and have cracks that open and close once each year and have slickensides.  Bieber soils have a duripan at a depth of 8 to 20 inches.  Casuse soils have ochric epipedons, have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches and are high in ash or pumice.  Delma soils have an aridic moisture regime and have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches.  Longcreek soils are underlain by hard bedrock at depths of 10 to 20 inches and have over 35 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon."
