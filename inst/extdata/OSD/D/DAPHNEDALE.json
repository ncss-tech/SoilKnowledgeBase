The soil between depths of 4 and 12 inches is dry in all parts from mid July to mid October and is moist in some part all the rest of the year.  It is moist in all parts from mid December to mid April.  The mollic epipedon is 11 to 17 inches thick.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The textural control section averages from 35 to 45 percent clay.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3 or 5/2, 5/3 or 5/4 and 10YR 2/2, 2/3, 3/2, or 3/3 moist.  Textures are stony sandy loam, stony loam, stony clay loam, sandy loam and loam.  This horizon is soft or slightly hard and is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 5/2 or 4/3; 7.5YR 4/2 and 10YR or 7.5YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3, or 3/4 moist.  It is clay loam, cobbly clay loam, or clay.  This horizon has subangular or angular blocky structure.   It is hard or very hard and is neutral or mildly alkaline.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Daphnedale soils are on terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in Plio- Pleistocene lake deposits, mainly of the Alturas formation, composed of basic igneous rocks, diatomite, tuff and pyroclastic material.  Elevations are 4200 to 4800 feet.  The climate is cool semiarid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cold snowy moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 16 inches.  Average January temperature is 27 to 30 degrees F.; average July temperature is 67 to 70 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 120 days."

Ager soils are clayey and have cracks that open and close once each year and have slickensides.  Bieber soils have a duripan at a depth of 8 to 20 inches.  Casuse soils have ochric epipedons, have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches and are high in ash or pumice.  Delma soils have an aridic moisture regime and have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches.  Longcreek soils are underlain by hard bedrock at depths of 10 to 20 inches and have over 35 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon."
