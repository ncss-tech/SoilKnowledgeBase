Reaction is moderately acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sandy loam, loam, or silt.\nSome pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.

Alonzville, Botetourt, Caverns, Coursey, Ingledove, Newmarc, and Shottower soils contain fewer rock fragments in the subsoil and are on stream terraces. Berks, Lehew, and Weikert soils are shallower to bedrock and are on uplands. Broadway, Gladehill, Gullion, Irongate, Nomberville, and Wolfgap soils contain fewer rock fragments in the subsoil and are on similar landscapes. Frederick and Groseclose soils contain fewer rock fragments in the subsoil, and are on uplands. Moomaw soils have a fragipan and are on stream terraces."
