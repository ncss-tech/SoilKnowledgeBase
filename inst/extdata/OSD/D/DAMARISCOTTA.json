  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is moderately acid to moderately alkaline in its natural condition and has an oxidized pH of ultra-acid to neutral. The electrical conductivity ranges from 0.6 to 4.5 dS/m in a 1:5 soil to water mixture by volume. Salt content ranges from about 5,000 to 35,000 ppm. Some pedons may contain sea shells. Total salt content is generally more than 15.6 dS/m.\nThe O horizon, where present, has a thickness from 1 to 20 cm and is neutral or has a hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is peat, muck, or mucky peat.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is very fine sandy loam or coarser and their mucky modifiers.\nSome pedons have an AC, or CA horizon. It is 5 to 15 cm thick. It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is very fine sandy loam through sand and their mucky modifiers.\nThe C horizon is neutral or has a hue of 2.5Y to 10B, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 3. Texture is dominantly loamy sand or sand. Some pedons have thin horizons of finer textures, but the weighted average textural class is sandy. Organic matter content ranges from less than 5 percent to 20 percent. The C horizon has 0 to 25 percent gravel. Shell fragments and herbaceous fibers are common.\nSome pedons have a sequence of buried O horizons that are 5 to 35 cm thick and separated by A and/or C horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Damariscotta soils are level and occur in tidal marshes along the coast of Maine. They are often associated with small berms adjacent to tidal inlets, rivers, channels and creeks. They can also be found on nearly level to gently sloping back-barrier flats and back-barrier beaches near tidal marshes. They are subject to tidal flooding twice daily, except in areas protected by dikes and tide gates. These soils developed in thick sand deposits and have slowly accumulated thin caps of organic materials at the surface. The mean annual temperature ranges from 5 to 9 degrees C and mean annual precipitation ranges from 1600 to 2200 mm."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fort Knox, Gouldsboro, Todds Point, Petit Manan, Phippsburg, and Pemaquid soils in nearby tidal marsh areas. Fort Knox soils have organic materials 40 to 130 cm thick and are underlain by loamy mineral materials. Gouldsboro soils are fine-silty mineral soils with a thin to absent organic cap less than 20 cm thick. Todds Point soils have organic materials greater than 130 cm thick and seldom have any mineral soil within 165 cm. Petit Manan soils have organic materials 40 to 130 cm thick and are underlain by fine-silty mineral materials. Phippsburg soils have an organic cap 20 to 40 cm thick and are underlain by sandy mineral materials. Pemaquid soils have organic materials 40 to 130 cm thick and are underlain by sandy mineral materials."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of these soils are used for wildlife habitat and recreation. Small scattered areas are used for saltgrass hay. The most common grasses are salt meadow grass, salt water grass, cord grass and spike grass. Other vegetation includes phragmites, blackgrass, sea lavender, saltwort, seaside goldenrod, aster, and purple gerardi. In areas where the 1:5 soil to water EC by volume is below 1.5 dS/m, the vegetation consists principally of tall reeds and sedges."
