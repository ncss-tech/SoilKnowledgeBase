  "OVERVIEW": "The Duffson series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and slope alluvium from sandstone and shale.  Duffson soils are on hills, ridges, escarpments and mountainsides.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 430mm (17 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C (41 F).",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 18 to 38 cm; depth to calcareous material ranges from 20 to 60 cm.  Depth to the lithic bedrock ranges from 50 to 100 cm.  Organic matter in the mollic epipedon ranges from 1 to 3 percent and decreases uniformly with increasing depth.  The soil is 90 to 100 percent base saturated.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume throughout, and are mainly pebbles and cobbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Usually the horizon has granular or crumb structure, but it has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  Texture is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, or fine sandy loam. It is moderately or strongly alkaline, and has 6 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. Some pedons have BCk horizons.  The Bk horizon does not meet the requirements for a calcic horizon, either by thickness or carbonate content."

Elevation ranges from 2,200-2,900 meters (7,200-9,500 ft.). The soils formed in parent material weathered from sandstone and interbedded shale.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is about 430mm (17 inches), but it ranges from 350-460mm (14-18 inches), with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and summer.  The mean annual air temperature (MAAT) ranges from 4.0 to 6.0 degrees C (39-43F).  The mean annual soil temperature (MAST) ranges from 6.0 to 8.0 degrees C (43-47F).  The average summer soil temperature is 17 degrees C (62F).  The frost-free season typically ranges from 60 to 90 days, but may extend slightly lower or higher by 10 days in some areas."
