These soils formed in alluvium, loess, and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,220 to 2,110 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
