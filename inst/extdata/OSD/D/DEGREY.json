  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonate ranges from 10 to 24 inches and typically is about 14 to 16 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  The natric horizon has an SAR and ESP of 10 to 20.  The thickness of the silty material ranges from 20 to more than 40 inches over glacial till.  This silty material contains less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon has value of 5 to 7 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  In cultivated areas the A and E horizons are mixed producing a gray cast in plowed fields.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Bt horizon commonly is silty clay, and less commonly silty clay loam, averaging between 35 and 50 percent clay.   It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, values of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  It has few to many, fine or medium accumulations of carbonate.  When present the 2Bk horizon has colors and textures of the 2C horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  It is loam or clay loam.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  It contains 1 to 10 percent coarse fragments. Visible salts typically are in the 2C horizon, but are in horizons with accumulations of carbonates in some pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cavo, Dudley, Dwight, Farmsworth, Mosher, and Wood River series.  Cavo, Dudley, Mosher, and Wood River soils contain more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the series control section.  In addition, Dudley soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick.  Dwight soils have a wetter soil moisture control section, warmer soil temperatures and have mean annual temperatures of more than 50 degrees F, and do not have 2C horizons.  Farmsworth soils have low chroma mottles in underlying material due to wetness."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  DeGrey soils are on silty mantled glacial till plains with plane to concave surfaces.  Slopes commonly are less than 2 percent but range from 0 to 6 percent.  The soils formed in 20 to 40 inches or more of silty materials over glacial till.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 21 inches.  Growing season is about 130 to 155 days; growing season precipitation ranges from 13 to 17 inches; and growing degree days is about 2800 to 3200."

The Agar, Eakin, and Highmore soils do not have natric horizons, are fine-silty in higher landscapes.  Hoven soils are wetter and in depressions. Onita soils have thicker mollic epipedons, do not have natric horizons, and are in swales.  Walke soils do not have columnar structure in the argillic horizon and have tonguing of an albic horizon into the argillic horizon.  Walke soils are intermingled with the DeGrey soils in similar landscapes."
