The natric horizon has an SAR and ESP of 10 to 20.  The thickness of the silty material ranges from 20 to more than 40 inches over glacial till.  This silty material contains less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon has value of 5 to 7 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  In cultivated areas the A and E horizons are mixed producing a gray cast in plowed fields.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Bt horizon commonly is silty clay, and less commonly silty clay loam, averaging between 35 and 50 percent clay.   It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, values of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  It has few to many, fine or medium accumulations of carbonate.  When present the 2Bk horizon has colors and textures of the 2C horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  It is loam or clay loam.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  It contains 1 to 10 percent coarse fragments. Visible salts typically are in the 2C horizon, but are in horizons with accumulations of carbonates in some pedons."

Cavo, Dudley, Mosher, and Wood River soils contain more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the series control section.  In addition, Dudley soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick.  Dwight soils have a wetter soil moisture control section, warmer soil temperatures and have mean annual temperatures of more than 50 degrees F, and do not have 2C horizons.  Farmsworth soils have low chroma mottles in underlying material due to wetness."

Onita soils have thicker mollic epipedons, do not have natric horizons, and are in swales.  Walke soils do not have columnar structure in the argillic horizon and have tonguing of an albic horizon into the argillic horizon.  Walke soils are intermingled with the DeGrey soils in similar landscapes."
