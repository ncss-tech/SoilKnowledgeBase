  "OVERVIEW": "The Dredge series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in  material weathered from mixed alluvium dominantly of quartzite,  rhyolite, sedimentary rocks and loess.  Dredge soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 1 to 5 percent.  The mean annual  precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
