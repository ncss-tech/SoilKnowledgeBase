  "OVERVIEW": "The Darlington series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Darlington soils are on fan terraces and stream terraces.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.   Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
