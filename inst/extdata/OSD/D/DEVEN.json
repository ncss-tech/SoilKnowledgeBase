  "OVERVIEW": "The Deven series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt, andesite and tuff.  The Deven soils are on plateaus and have slopes of 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",

Increase with depth and make up to 25 percent of the volume and are most common in the lower part.  These fragments consist of basalt gravel, cobblestones and stones.\nA horizon\nHue: 10YR or 7.5YR.\nValue: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.\nHue 2 or 3.\nStructure:  Weak or moderate very fine to medium platy subangular blocky or granular structure.\nBt horizon\nHue 10YR or 7.5YR.\nValue: 3 through 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nChroma: 2 through 4.\nTexture: Clay loam or clay with and has at least 8 percent more clay than the A horizon.\nStructure: Angular blocky or prismatic structure.\nOther features: Some pedons have a Bt2 horizon, a transitional Bt3 horizon or a C horizon.  These are similar to the Bt horizon but commonly have subangular blocky structure or are massive. The soil fills the space between the fractures in the bedrock and is in pockets.  Some pedons have a very thin discontinuous coating of carbonate and silica capping the bedrock."

The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt, andesite and hard tuff.  Elevations are 1,070 to 1,985 meters.  Deven soils are commonly in association or complex with rock outcrop.  The climate is cool semiarid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 250 to 460 mm.  Seasonal snowfall is 60 to 120 cm.  Mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 70 to 130 days."
