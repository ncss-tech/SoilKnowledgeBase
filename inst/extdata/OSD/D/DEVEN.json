    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture: Usually dry in all parts from June 1 until October 30 and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year; xeric soil moisture regime bordering on aridic.\nMean annual soil temperature: 8 to 13 degrees C.\nDepth to a lithic contact of hard fractured basalt: 25 to 50 cm.\nReaction: Slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: 35 to 50 percent.\nRock fragments: Average less than 15 percent. Increase with depth and make up to 25 percent of the volume and are most common in the lower part.  These fragments consist of basalt gravel, cobblestones and stones.\nA horizon\nHue: 10YR or 7.5YR.\nValue: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.\nHue 2 or 3.\nStructure:  Weak or moderate very fine to medium platy subangular blocky or granular structure.\nBt horizon\nHue 10YR or 7.5YR.\nValue: 3 through 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nChroma: 2 through 4.\nTexture: Clay loam or clay with and has at least 8 percent more clay than the A horizon.\nStructure: Angular blocky or prismatic structure.\nOther features: Some pedons have a Bt2 horizon, a transitional Bt3 horizon or a C horizon.  These are similar to the Bt horizon but commonly have subangular blocky structure or are massive. The soil fills the space between the fractures in the bedrock and is in pockets.  Some pedons have a very thin discontinuous coating of carbonate and silica capping the bedrock."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Deven soils are on hummocky plateaus and plateau escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt, andesite and hard tuff.  Elevations are 1,070 to 1,985 meters.  Deven soils are commonly in association or complex with rock outcrop.  The climate is cool semiarid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 250 to 460 mm.  Seasonal snowfall is 60 to 120 cm.  Mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 70 to 130 days."
