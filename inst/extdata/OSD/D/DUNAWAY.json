  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dunaway soils occur floodplain steps of mountain valley bottoms at elevations of 3,400 to 5,500 feet. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. These soils formed in Holocene-age stratified sandy and gravelly alluvium derived from mostly limestone and dolomite with some other sedimentary rocks. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 17 in, mostly occurring as high intensity rain during afternoon thunderstorms from July to September;  mean annual air temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F. The frost-free period is 212 to 246 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Choza and Pinery soils. Pinery soils formed on stream terraces, often in the same drainage as Dunaway soils.  Pinery also forms on fan remnants, along with Choza soils.   Choza is shallow to a petrocalcic horizon and Pinery is very deep with a well developed mollic epipedon."
