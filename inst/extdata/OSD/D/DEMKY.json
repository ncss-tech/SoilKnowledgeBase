The thickness of mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches and in some pedons extends into the Bt horizon.  The natric horizon contains an estimates SAR or ESP of 10 to 20.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or loam and is slightly acid or neutral.  Some pedons have thin E horizons which have hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.\nThe B/E horizon has colors of the E and Bt horizons.  It typically is clay loam, but some pedons are silty clay loam or silt loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam or clay averaging between 35 and 45 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam or clay.  It has few to many, fine or medium accumulations of carbonate.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
