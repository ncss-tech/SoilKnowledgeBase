  "OVERVIEW": "The Doublecreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils on canyon toe slopes and foot slopes and on alluvial terraces. Doublecreek soils formed in colluvium and alluvium from basalt with volcanic ash and loess mixed in the upper part. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
