  "OVERVIEW": "The Doglake series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that are 20 to 40 inches deep over cobble and gravel.  They formed in alluvium.  These soils are on giant ripple marks.  Slopes are 2 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
