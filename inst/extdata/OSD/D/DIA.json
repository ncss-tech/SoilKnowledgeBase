    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dia soils are on flood plains and low stream terraces.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,158 to 1,463 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 90 and 150 cm (moderately deep and deep free water occurrence classes) from March through September.  Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent.  Some areas may have high water tables within 50 cm of the soil surface in depressional areas as a result of excessive irrigation and lack of subsurface drainage.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods or occasional flooding for long periods year-round."

The vegetation in rangeland is mainly basin big sagebrush and basin wildrye.  Saline-sodic areas have black greasewood and inland saltgrass."
