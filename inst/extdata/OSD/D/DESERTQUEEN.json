Chiminea soils have hues redder than 7.5YR in the Bt horizon and average 18 to 25 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Pinyonpeak soils do not receive considerable amounts of summer precipitation and are not intermittently moist in the control section for 10 to 20 days in July through September."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Desertqueen soils are on pediments, hills, and mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent. These soils formed in alluvially-influenced colluvium and/or residuum derived from granite and gneissic rocks. Elevation is 960 to 1575 meters (3,150 to 5,165 feet). The climate is arid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 175 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is 13 to 17 degrees C. The frost free season is 210 to 270 days."

Contactmine, Hexie, Ironped, Pinecity and Seanna soils are on similar landscape positions. Contactmine and Hexie soils are moderately deep. In addition, Contactmine soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section. Hexie soils are typically found on adjacent south-facing slopes and have a warmer soil temperature regime. Ironped and Pinecity soils lack argillic horizons and are sandy above a paralthic contact. Jumborox soils are on adjacent fan remnants and are very deep. Seanna soils have a warmer soil temperature regime, lack an argllic horizon and are loamy-skeletal throughout the particle-size control section."
