    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nTypically, this soil is calcareous throughout but is leached in the upper part of the series control section in some pedons.\nThe control section is sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand..\nCoarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent but are commonly less than 3 percent. These soils may have a weak and inconsistent accumulation of secondary calcium carbonate at any depth but are not considered to have a continuous Bk horizon.\nThe soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. and is never moist in some or all parts for as long as 60 consecutive days when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F., which occurs about April 21-27, but is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days from July 15 to October 25 and for at least 90 cumulative days during this period. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days. Bedrock is deeper than 60 inches.\nA horizon :\nHue: 2.5Y or 10YR,\nValue: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and\nChroma: 2 or 3.\nTexture: Fine sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand\nClay content: 2-10 percent\nSand content: greater than 80 percent\nReaction: mildly alkaline through strongly alkaline but is slightly acid or neutral in some pedons\nAC horizon:\nTexture: loamy fine sand or fine sand is in some pedon.\nThe C horizon:\nHue: 2.5Y through 7.5YR\nValue: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist\nChroma:2 through 4\nTexture: Fine sand or loamy fine sand\nClay content: 2-10 percent\nSand content: greater than 80 percent\nReaction:  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline and may contain few small carbonate concretions or seams of calcium carbonate erratically at any depth"
