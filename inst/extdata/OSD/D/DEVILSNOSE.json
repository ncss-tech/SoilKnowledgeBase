  "OVERVIEW": "The Devilsnose series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in ashy colluvium over weathered colluvium and residuum from andesitic tuff breccia. The Devilsnose soils are on mountainflanks of lahars. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1245 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
