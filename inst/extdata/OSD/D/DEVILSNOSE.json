These soils formed in ashy colluvium over weathered colluvium and residuum from andesitic tuff breccia. Elevation is 900 to 1450 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1000 to 1300 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C.

Iron Mountain soils are shallow and occur on mountaintops and steep mountainflanks. Lilygap soils are medial over loamy and occur on the lower portions of mountainflanks. Mantree soils occur on mountaintops and mountainflanks below lahars and formed in residuum from intrusive igneous rock. McCarthy soils occur in a similar landform position as Devilsnose but are moderately deep. Redapple soils occur on stable summits and backslopes of lahars and are fine."
