    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Denny soils are typically in shallow depressions on loess-covered ground moraines. Less commonly, they occur on nearly level low summits and talfs. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The Denny soils formed in loess. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8.9 to 12.2 degrees C (48 to 54 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1,016 mm (36 to 40 inches). Frost-free period ranges from 160 to 190 days. Elevation ranges from 122 to 253 meters (400 to 830 feet) above mean sea level."

Atterberry, Ipava, Muscatune, and Osco soils are on nearby, slightly higher, convex positions and are better drained. Edgington soils are on similar positions, have mollic epipedons, and have less clay in the argillic horizons. Sable soils are Mollisols and do not have an albic horizon. They are on nearby similar landform positions."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained.  In the undrained condition, these soils have an apparent water table from 0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 inches) below the surface from November through June in normal years and also pond water from 0 to 20 cm (0 to 12 inches) above the surface for long to very long periods from November to June in most years. In the drained condition, these soils have an apparent water table from 0 to 30 cm (0 to 18 inches) below the surface from January through May in normal years and also pond water from 0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 inches) above the surface for brief periods from January through May. The water table and ponding depth may vary based on local precipitation amounts.  The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low to moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers per second). Permeability is slow."
