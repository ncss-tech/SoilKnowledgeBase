  "OVERVIEW": "The Denny series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loess. Denny soils are on slightly depressional parts of ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.6 degrees C (51 degrees F).",

Edgington soils are on similar positions, have mollic epipedons, and have less clay in the argillic horizons. Sable soils are Mollisols and do not have an albic horizon.

In the drained condition, these soils have an apparent water table from 0 to 30 cm (0 to 18 inches) below the surface from January through May in normal years and also pond water from 0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 inches) above the surface for brief periods from January through May. The water table and ponding depth may vary based on local precipitation amounts.  The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low to moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers per second). Permeability is slow."
