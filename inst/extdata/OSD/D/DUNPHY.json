  "OVERVIEW": "The Dunphy series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Dunphy soils are on flood plains and alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; low or medium surface runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  These soils were formed under more poorly drained conditions than occur today.  Entrenchment of stream channels, isolation due to stream meandering, and local alluvial faulting have improved the drainage.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 75 and 100 cm (moderately deep free water occurrence class) between March and June.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  Drained phases are recognized.  Some phases are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods year-round."

Future study is needed to determine the amount of volcanic glass in this series and whether the taxonomic class should be changed to Ashy, glassy, calcareous, mesic Aquandic Halaquepts.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).\nDurinodes - The zone from 114 to 155 cm (4Ckq horizon).\nDuric feature - The zones from 8 to 56 cm and 69 to 89 cm (Cqk, 2Cq1, and 2Cq2 horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 75 and 100 cm at certain times during normal years (2Cq2 and 3C horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (2C, 2Cq1, and 2Cq2 horizons and parts of the Cqk and 3C horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
