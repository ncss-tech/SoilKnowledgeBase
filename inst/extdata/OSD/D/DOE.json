These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the volcanic ash mantle ranges from 20 to 35 inches and has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.00 to 1.20 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10  percent for air dried samples.  The 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is slightly acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly ashy sandy loam or very cobbly ashy coarse sandy loam.   It has 25 to 30 percent pebbles, 10 to 25 percent cobbles, and 0 to 2 percent stones.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry.  It is very gravelly or very cobbly loamy coarse sand.  It has 25 to 35 percent pebbles, 10 to 25 percent cobbles, and 0 to 2 percent stones."

Kusu soils are 40 to 60 inches to lithic contact.  Pettijohn soils are 30 to 45 inches to loamy-skeletal glacial till or colluvium from granitics.  Stices soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Twelvemile soils have 7 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have a Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Doe soils are on back slopes of mountains at elevations of 2,800 to 4,700 feet.  Slopes are 35 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in a mixture of volcanic ash and granitic colluvium over glacial outwash or ablation till.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 24 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 22 to 26 degrees F, the average July temperature ranges from 62 to 67 degrees F, and the average annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 95 to 120 days."
