  "OVERVIEW": "The Dutchhollow series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  These soils occur on flood plains, stream terraces and drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
