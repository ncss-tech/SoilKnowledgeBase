  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 50 inches. Depth to carbonates ranges from 30 to 60 inches. Depth to shale bedrock ranges from 40 inches to 10 feet or more. Rock fragments range from 2 to 35 percent in the solum, and include up to 5 percent greater than 3 inches in diameter. Rock fragments range from 10 to 60 percent in the C horizon and include 5 to 10 percent greater than 3 inches in diameter. Rock fragments greater than 10 inches in diameter cover 0 to 20 percent of the surface. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part of the solum, moderately acid to neutral in the Bt horizons, and slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline beneath.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Redoximorphic features, if present, are few to common, faint to distinct and high chroma. The E horizon is loam, silt loam or light silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky or is platy. Consistence is friable or firm consistence.\nThe B/E horizon has colors similar to the Bt in the B portion and colors similar to the E in the E portion. It contains either high or low chroma redoximorphic features or both. The B/E horizon is silty clay loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chromas of 2 through 4. It contains both high and low chroma redoximorphic features. Typically, chroma becomes lower with depth. Texture is silty clay loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction, but may contain coarser or finer textured subhorizons with an overall average clay content of 27 to 35 percent. The Bt horizon has weak or moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky structure. Some pedons have a BC horizon that has colors and textures similar to the B or C horizons that contain free carbonates.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is heavy loam, clay loam or silty clay loam textures in the fine earth fraction. It is massive or has plate-like divisions."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Aurora, Conesus, Grindstone, and Nunda series are members of the same family. Aurora soils are underlain by bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Conesus soils have average clay content of 18 to 27 percent. Grindstone soils have a densic contact above 40 inches. Nunda soils have a lithologic discontinuity in the control section.\nBombay, Cazenovia, Darien, Hilton, and Lima are similar soils in related families. Bombay soils have coarse-loamy particle size control sections. Cazenovia soils have hues of 2.5YR to 7.5YR in the Bt horizons and lack 2 chroma redoximorphic depletions in the argillic horizon. Hilton and Lima soils lack 2 chroma redoximorphic depletions in the argillic horizons and have average clay content of 18 to 27 percent. Darien soils have aquic moisture regimes."

The somewhat poorly drained Darien and poorly drained Ilion soils are in a drainage sequence with Danley soils. Hudson soils have fine particle sized control sections. Langford soils contain a fragipan. Lansing soils have less clay in the Bt horizons and are well drained. Remsen soils formed in fine textured till."
