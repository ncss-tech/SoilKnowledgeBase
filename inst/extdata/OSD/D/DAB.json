Aspetill soils are dominated by cobbles in the particle-size control section.  Badwater soils have 25 to 35 percent clay and are dominated by boulders in the particle-size control section.  Bickmore, Bluebell, Buena Vista, Blackbear, Hawkinspeak, Littlemud, Rutherford, and Woodhurst soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Booneville soils average 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have mean annual soil temperature of 2 to 4 degrees C.  Dailybasin and Igor soils have an ustic moisture regime.  Delhew soils have mollic epipedons that are 60 to 100 cm thick and are dominated by fine gravel of granitic lithology in the particle-size control section.  Keman soils have mean annual soil temperature of 4 to 6 degrees C. and have mollic epipedons that are 76 to 127 cm thick.  Lostcannon soils are dominated by fine gravel (2 to 5 mm diameter) and average 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Monibasin soils are dominated by stones in the particle-size control section.  Parkalley soils are dominated by flagstones and average 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Parkay soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Redbird soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates within 100 cm of the soil surface.  Sweetmount soils are deep to paralithic contacts and have subhorizons of the argillic horizon with 27 to 50 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dab soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from altered volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,316 to 3,050 meters.  The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 760 mm, the mean annual temperature is 2 to 6 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 70 days."
