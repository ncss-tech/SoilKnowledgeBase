There is less than 15 percent sodium in the upper part of the natric horizon.  Depth to secondary carbonates is 10 to 16 inches and carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 40 percent.  The argillic horizon has 27 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 50 degrees to 53 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 67 degrees to 71 degrees F.  These soils are dry more than one/half the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F., but are continually moist 25 to 30 percent of the time.  The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  The value of 5 dry and 3 moist occur only in the upper 2 or 3 inches.  This horizon ranges from sandy loam to sandy clay, loam and contains 0 to 15 percent rock fragments.  It is 3 to 6 inches thick.\nThe B2t horizon has prismatic structure that parts to moderate very fine through coarse subangular blocky.  It ranges from clay loam to sandy clay loam and has 0 to 10 percent rock fragments.  This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe B3tca horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 through 6.  It ranges from clay loam to sandy clay loam and has 0 to 15 percent rock fragments.  This horizon is moderately or strongly calcareous and strongly or very strongly alkaline.\nThe Cca horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, clay loam, or loam and has 0 to 40 percent rock fragments.  This horizon is moderately or strongly calcareous, moderately through very strongly alkaline and is 19 to 43 inches thick.)"

The climate is semiarid and average annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 12 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 48 degrees to 51 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F.
