  "OVERVIEW": "The Dunkleber series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in mucky peat.  These soils are in closed depressions, drainageways and floodplains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
