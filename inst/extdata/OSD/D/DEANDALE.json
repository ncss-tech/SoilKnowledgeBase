  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches. Depth to secondary carbonates typically ranges from 12 to 28 inches. The clay content of the control section averages from 35 to 40 percent. Carbonates vary from threads and films to soft masses and concretions. Salinity ranges from 1 to 18 mmhos/cm. Saline phases are also recognized. Exchangeable sodium ranges from 4 to 14 percent in the upper 16 inches of the argillic horizon.  The Linear Extensibility in the upper 100 cm is 6 to 8.5 cm and or there are cracks that are 5mm to 10 mm wide throughout a thickness of 30 cm or more and or there are slickensides.\nThe A horizon has colors in hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 5.5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam. The reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has colors with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. The texture is clay loam or clay with clay content of 35 to 45 percent. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline and typically is noncalcareous.\nThe Btk horizon has colors with hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. The texture is clay loam or clay. Carbonates range from 3 to 10 percent by volume and the reaction is commonly moderately alkaline and calcareous.\nThe B't horizon has colors in shades of red, brown, gray or yellow. The texture is clay loam or clay. Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Carbonates range from none to a few, however, it is typically calcareous."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no series in this family. Closely similar soils include the Bethany, Darrouzett, Foard, Hollister, Kamay, Kirkland, Rotan and Tillman series. Bethany, Darrouzett, Hollister, Rotan and Tillman soils have mixed clay mineralogy. Also, these soils do not have an abrupt textural change between the A and Bt horizons. Foard soils have a natric horizon. Kamay soils do not have a mollic epipedon. Kirkland soils are members of the udertic subgroup and have high shrink-swell properties."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Deandale soils are on nearly level or very gently sloping plains. Slope gradients are mostly less than 1 percent, but some are as much as 3 percent. The soil formed in clayey slopewash or over slope alluvium and or clayey residum. The climate is subhumid. The average annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 30 inches, the mean annual temperature varies from 63 degrees to 65 degrees F., and the Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 34 to 44."

Hollister, Kamay and Tillman soils are on similar positions. Vernon soils are on higher knolls and shoulderslopes along drainageways. Wichita and Winters soils are on slightly higher convex divides."
