  "OVERVIEW": "The Darsil series consist of shallow, excessively drained, soils that formed in material weathered from weakly cemented sandstone of Permian age. These soils occur on convex ridge crests of low hills in the North Cross Timbers (MLRA84A). Slopes range from 1 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 864 mm (34 in). Mean air annual temperature is 15.5 degrees C (60 degrees F).",
