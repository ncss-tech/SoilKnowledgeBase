    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments range from 20 to 75 percent throughout the profile with the control section averaging more than 35 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature just above bedrock varies from 47 degrees and 53 degrees F.  The soils become moist in some or all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches or to the lithic contact from about mid-October until late June and are dry throughout the rest of the year.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, or 5/2 and 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4; 7.5YR 3/2, 4/2, or 4/4 moist.  The dark layers are thin or absent in some pedons or may extend into the upper 2 inches of the B horizon.  Texture is sandy loam, loam or silt loam and is gravelly or very gravelly.  Reaction is slightly through strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 5/4, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6, 7/4, 7/6; 7.5YR 5/6, 6/4, 6/6 and 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6, 6/2, 6/3; 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6 moist.  Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky.  Texture is silt loam, sandy loam or loam with a slight clay increase over the A horizon and is very or extremely gravelly.  Base saturation ranges from about 40 to 60 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Deadwood soils are gently sloping to very steep on mountains at elevations of 3,000 to 6,000 feet.  Slopes are 2 to 100 percent.  Underlying bedrock is consolidated metasedimentary rock.  The climate is typified by warm summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 65 inches, some of which occurs as snow.  The average annual temperature is 47 degrees to 57 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is 39 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is 69 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is 110 to 200 days."

Hurlbut soils are more than 20 inches deep to a paralithic contact and have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Mariposa soils have an argillic horizon in a part of each pedon.  Smokey soils have a frigid temperature regime, and a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches."
