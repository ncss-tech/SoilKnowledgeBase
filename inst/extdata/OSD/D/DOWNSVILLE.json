  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 60 to 110 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater then 60 inches. Rock fragments of sandstone, shale, limestone, and chert, range form 15 to 40 percent in the Ap and BE horizons, and from 35 to 70 percent in the Bt and BC horizons, and from 3 to 25 percent in the 2C horizon. Rock fragments are gravel, cobble, and channer in size.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral where limed.\nThe A and Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value 3 through 5, chroma 4 or 6. In wooded areas chroma ranges from 2 through 6. Texture in the fine earth fraction is commonly gravelly loam, but includes sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam, and their gravelly analogous . Gravels range form 15 to 30 percent and cobbles range form 0 to 10 percent.  Reaction ranges form slightly acid through neutral where limed and from slightly acid to moderately acid.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 10YR, value 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture in the fine earth fraction is commonly loam, but includes sandy loam, fine sandy loam or silt loam and their gravelly analogous. Gravels range form 15 to 30 percent and cobbles range from 5 to 15 percent. Reaction ranges form slightly acid through moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 through 8. Texture in the fine earth fraction is commonly clay loam or sandy clay loam, but includes loam and their gravelly analogous. Clay textures are common in the lower portions of the Bt horizon.  Gravels range form 35 to 60 percent and cobbles range from 5 to 20 percent. Reaction ranges form very strongly acid to strongly acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 through 8. Texture in the fine earth fraction is commonly clay loam or sandy clay loam, but includes clay and their gravelly analogous. Gravels range form 35 to 60 percent and cobbles range from 0 to 15 percent. Reaction ranges form very strongly acid to strongly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Texture in the fine earth fraction is commonly loam, or silt loam, but includes clay loam and their channery analogous.  Gravels and Channers range from 5 to 20 percent.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Downsville soils are on high stream terraces, approximately 100 to 250 feet above the active flood plain. Topography is dominantly rolling and hilly but ranges from undulating to steep.  Slopes range form 0 to 45 percent.  These soils formed in old alluvium or unconsolidated material of sandstone, shale, limestone and chert.  Limestone rock outcrops are common when this material is overlying limestone bedrock. Sink holes make up approximately 5 percent of the landscape when over limestone bedrock.  Mean annual temperature ranges form 50 to 54 degrees F. and annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 55 inches."

Monongahela and Tyler are moderately well drained and some what poorly drained respectively. Hagerstown, Duffield, Ryder, and Opequon form from limestone residuum. Berks, Calvin, and Weikert formed from shale.  Murrill is formed from colluvial material and is fine loamy in the fine earth fraction."
