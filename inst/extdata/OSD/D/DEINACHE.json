  "REVDATE": "9/97",
  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Deinache series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed on nearly level sandy areas within lake plains.  Permeability is rapid in the upper part and moderately rapid or moderate in the loamy substrata. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 34 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 6 to 25 inches.  Carbonates, if present, are below a depth of 50 inches. Redoximorphic features consisting of accumulations of iron or manganese oxides, and iron or clay depletions occur above 20 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Rock fragments are typically absent, but may range up to 2 percent by volume in the substratum.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the surface layer, and neutral to moderately alkaline in the subsoil and substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.  The A horizon in uncultivated areas has value or chroma one unit lower than an Ap horizon.\nThe Bg horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is weak or very weak subangular blocky or granular.  Consistence is very friable.\nThe Cg and 2Cg horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y, or are neutral, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture above a depth of 40 inches is fine sand or loamy fine sand.  Below 40 inches texture also includes loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam and thin subhorizons (generally less than 10 inches) of silt loam.  They are generally single grain or massive.  Consistence is friable, very friable or loose."

Cormant soils do not have 2Cg horizons with textures finer than loamy fine sand.  Roscommon soils are dominantly coarse and medium sand below the surface layer.  Wabun soils have silty or clay textures in the lower substrata.  Wheatley soils have stratified calcareous sand and gravel within the control section."

Wonsqueak, Wainola, Flackville, Pinconning and Cook soils are also associated.  Wonsqueak soils are in depressions and are organic soils.  Flackville and Wainola soils are in higher positions on the landscape and have spodic horizons.   Pinconning and Cook soils are in similar positions on the landscape as Deinache.  They both are sandy soils underlain by finer textured deposits within a 40 inch depth. Elevation ranges from 200 to 600 feet above sea-level."
