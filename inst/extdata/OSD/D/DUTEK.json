  "OVERVIEW": "The Dutek series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in loamy and sandy alluvial material. These soils are on gently sloping to strongly sloping stream terraces of river valleys. Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1012 mm (40 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F).",
