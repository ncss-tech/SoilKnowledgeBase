  "REVDATE": "10/2018",
  "STATES": "LA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Duralde series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in thick loess.  These soils are on convex, circular mounds and gentle side slopes on terrace uplands.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60, commonly over 100 inches.  Typically these soils have less than 3 percent sand, but range up to 10 percent.  Grayish mottles due to wetness occur within 30 inches of the surface.\nThe A horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), brown (10YR 4/3), dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), pale brown (10YR 6/3), or light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4).  It is silt loam and strongly acid through medium acid.\nThe B1 horizon is brown (10YR 5/3), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6), pale brown (10YR 6/3), or light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt loam.  It is very strongly through medium acid.\nA pale brown (10YR 6/3) or light gray (10YR 7/2), silt loam, discontinuous A'2 horizon occurs as tongues around peds in the B&A horizon and occupies up to 50 percent of the mass.  The Bt horizon\nis brown (10YR 4/3, 5/3), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6) with few to many gray or grayish brown mottles.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam.  The brown portions are brittle and dense and are similar to material in fragipans.  The B1 and B22t horizons are medium acid through very strongly acid and range to neutral in the B23t horizon."

Calloway and Grenada soils are quite similar in texture and horizon sequence but have fragipan horizons.  Evangeline and Messer soils lack gray mottles within 30 inches of the surface and in addition the Messer soils have B horizons that average less than 18 percent clay in the upper part and are siliceous.  Falkner, Muskogee, and Vidrine soils have more than 35 percent clay in the lower B horizons.  Fred soils are more alkaline and have carbonate nodules in the B horizon.  Frizzell and Glenmora soils have siliceous mineralogy and in addition the Frizzell soils have less than 18 percent clay in the upper B horizons.  Leverett and Tippo soils have coarse-silty control sections.  Wanilla soils have coarse-loamy control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Duralde soils are on convex circular mounds and gentle side slopes of nearly level loess covered plains.  Circular mounds are about 70 feet in diameter, 20 inches in height and 1 to 4 per acre in number.  Slope gradients range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mound slope gradients average about 4 percent.  Climate is warm and humid.  The average air temperature is about 68\ndegrees F., and the average annual rainfall is about 58 inches.  Thornthwaite's P-E index is about 70."
