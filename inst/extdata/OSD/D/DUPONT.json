  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Organic material ranges in thickness from 52 inches to more than 10 feet.  Depth to the limnic materials is 7 to 24 inches near the perimeter of most bogs and 24 to 50 inches near the center.  These soils are mostly decomposed materials from spirea, sedges, and grasses.  The control section is sapric material with an unrubbed fiber content of 20 to 40 percent and a rubbed fiber content from 10 to less than 5 percent.  The limnic materials are diatomaceous earth and are generally mixed with volcanic ash and are 2 to 10 inches thick.  Some pedons have more than one layer of limnic material.  The limnic materials have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10 YR, or 2.5YR, value of 3 through 8 and chroma of 0 through 4.  The tiers have hue of 5YR or 10YR.  The soils are strongly or very strongly acid."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Mukilteo, Orcas, Seattle, Semiahmoo, Shalcar, Tanwax, and Tukwila series in other families.  Mukilteo and Seattle soils have control sections of hemic material.  Orcas soils have fibric material in the control section.  Semiahmoo soils lack limnic layers within the control section.  Shalcar soils are muck over loamy mineral layers within the control section.  Tanwax soils are medial and composed of sedimentary peat.  Tukwila soils are dysic."

Mean January temperature is 40 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 57 degrees F.; and mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 150 to 250 days."
