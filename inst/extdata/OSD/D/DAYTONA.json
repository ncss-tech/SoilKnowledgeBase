  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Daytona series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately rapid permeable soils on knolls and ridges in the flatwoods.  They formed in sandy deposits of marine or eolian sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",

Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 3 to 5.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or coarse sand throughout.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 7 or 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Streaks in shades of gray and brown range from none to common.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or coarse sand throughout.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 4; Less than 25 percent of the entire Bh horizon vertical thickness or a sub horizon 1 inch or more thick in less than 50 percent of each pedon may be weakly cemented.  Redoximorphic features and discontinuous streaks in shades of brown, red, and gray range from few to common.  The thickness of the Bh horizon is variable within short distances.  In places, the E horizon tongues through the Bh into the Bw&Bh horizon.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or coarse sand throughout.\nThe Bw part of the Bw&Bh horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The Bh part has the same color range as the Bh horizon and occurs as bodies of soft nodules.  Organic matter accumulations and depletions in shades of brown range from few to common.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or coarse sand throughout.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 4 or less.   Redoximorphic accumulations in shades of brown range from none to common.  Tongues may extend into the C horizon from the Bw&Bh horizon.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or coarse sand throughout."

The very poorly or poorly drained Basinger soils are on lower positions, have weak spodic horizons, and are sandy throughout.  Cassia and Myakka soils are on lower positions and are less than 30 inches in depth to the spodic horizon.  In addition, Cassia soils are somewhat poorly drained and Myakka soils are very poorly to poorly drained.  The very poorly or poorly drained Immokalee soils are on lower positions.  The somewhat poorly to moderately well drained Pomello soils are on similar to lower positions.  Tavares soils are on similar positions but are sandy throughout."
