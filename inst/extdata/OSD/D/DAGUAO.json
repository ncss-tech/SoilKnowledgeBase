Few to many fine to medium size dark hornblende fragments are throughout the soil.  Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay or silty clay.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Daguao soils are on moderately steep to steep mountains.  Slopes range from 20 to 60 percent.  The regolith consists of moderately fine to fine-textured residuum weathered from volcanic rocks that are very high in hornblende.  The climate is humid tropical.  Average annual rainfall is 80 to 85 inches, and average annual temperature is 79 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are in the Ejemplo, Laura, Naranjito, and Pandura series.  The Ejemplo soils are on footslopes and fans below the Daguao soils.  The Pandura soils occur on similar slopes but have grayer colors, coarser textures, and less well expressed Bt horizons.  The Laura soils on low rolling granite hills are deeper, coarser in texture, and have less well expressed Bt horizons that are redder in color.  The Naranjito soils have less well expressed structure in the Bt horizon and are redder in color."

The previous OSED was dated 4/87.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon - zone from 0 to 8 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - zone from 8 to 21 inches (Bt horizons)\nParalithic contact at 21 inches (Cr layer)\nLithic contact - at 34 inches (R layer)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
