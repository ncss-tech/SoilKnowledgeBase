  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Daguao series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on sideslopes in mountains.  They formed in moderately fine and fine textured residuum derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes range from 20 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 82 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F.",

Few to many fine to medium size dark hornblende fragments are throughout the soil.  Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay or silty clay.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8."

The regolith consists of moderately fine to fine-textured residuum weathered from volcanic rocks that are very high in hornblende.  The climate is humid tropical.  Average annual rainfall is 80 to 85 inches, and average annual temperature is 79 degrees F."

The Pandura soils occur on similar slopes but have grayer colors, coarser textures, and less well expressed Bt horizons.  The Laura soils on low rolling granite hills are deeper, coarser in texture, and have less well expressed Bt horizons that are redder in color.  The Naranjito soils have less well expressed structure in the Bt horizon and are redder in color."
