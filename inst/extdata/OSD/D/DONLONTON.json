  "OVERVIEW": "The Donlonton series consists of very deep, moderately well and somewhat poorly drained soils formed in old marine sediments containing moderate amounts of glauconite.  They are nearly level and gently sloping soils on the northern Atlantic Coastal Plain.  Typically these soils have fine sandy loam A horizons, olive brown sandy clay loam and sandy clay Bt horizons and dark olive green fine sandy loam C horizons high in glauconite.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Thin strata containing ferruginous sandstone (ironstone) or ferruginous concretions are in the solum, and thicker but discontinuous strata are in the C horizon of some pedons.  The soil is strongly or very strongly acid unless limed.\nThe A and E horizons have hues of 2.5Y or 10YR, values of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 8, witdh lowest values and chromas confined to A horizons.  They are fine sandy loam, loam, or loamy fine sand.\nThe B horizon has hues of 10YR through 5Y, values of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Mottles have hues of 7.5YR through 5GY, value of 3 to 5, and chromas of 1 to 8.  The B horizon is heavy sandy clay loam or sandy clay.\nThe C horizon has hues or 10YR through 5G, values of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The C horizon ranges from fine sandy loam to clay loam."

All of these soils lack glauconite.\nThe Adelphia, Conasauga, Craven, Creedmore, Fawsett, Helena, Holmdel, Kresson and Wolftener series are similar soils in related families.  Adelphia and Holmdel soils have less than 35 percent clay.  Conasauga, Craven, Helena, and Wolftener soils have mean annual temperatures greater than 50 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation of about 40 inches."
