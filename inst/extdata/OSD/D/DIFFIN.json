(xeric).  The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 40 inches or more.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to secondary carbonate accumulation is 15 to 30 inches.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam with 18 to 25 percent clay.  It has 0 to 20 percent stones, 15 to 25 percent cobbles, and 5 to 20 percent gravel.\nThe 2Bt horizons have values of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is clay with 45 to 60 percent clay.  Total rock fragments average 35 to 45 percent with 0 to 15 percent stones, 15 to 25 percent cobbles, and 10 to 20 percent gravel.  In some pedons, secondary carbonates are present in the lower part with value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.\nThe 2Bk horizons have values of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.

Bingville soils are moderately deep to basalt bedrock, lack secondary carbonates, and are found on higher plateaus.  Gwin and Kettenbach soils are found on adjacent south slopes and have a mesic moisture regime.  Gwin soils are shallow to bedrock and Kettenbach soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Prill soils are moderately deep to a paralithic material, mesic temperature regime, and are found on gently slopes below basalt cliffs."
