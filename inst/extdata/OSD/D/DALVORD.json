  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Akela (NM+AZ), Beach (TX), Galehills (NV), Haleburu (CA+NV), Hindu (AZ), Hulda (AZ), Noble Pass (CA), Paintrocks (CA), Pearce (AZ), Razorback (AZ), Tecopa (CA+NV) and Upspring (CA+NV) series. Akela soils formed in calcareous material from basaltic alluvium and rhyolitic tuff and Beach soils formed from fine grained metamorphic sandstone and have an A horizon with hues of 2.5YR or 5YR. In addition, both Akela and Beach soils have a soil moisture control section that is moist in some part for more than 20 days cumulative between June and September. Galehills soils are formed in sandstone conglomerate parent material and have 10 to 25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in Bk horizons. Haleburu soils are derived from volcanic rock and are strongly alkaline in the subsoil. Hindu soils form from limestone or calcareous sedimentary rocks. Hindu soils have an average calcium carbonate equivalent of 20 to 35 percent above the bedrock. In addition, Hindu and Hulda soils receive average annual precipitation of more than 200 millimeters and have a soil moisture control section that is moist in some part for more than 20 days cumulative between June and September. Noble Pass soils formed in rhyolitic parent material. Paintrocks soils are less than 8 centimeters to a lithic or paralithic contact. Pearce soils formed in limestone parent material and Razorback soils formed from volcanic rock sources. Pearce soils have a calcium carbonate equivalent of 5 to 35 percent throughout the particle-size control section. In addition, Pearce and Razorback soils receive average annual precipitation of more than 200 millimeters. Tecopa soils are derived from mixed metamorphic and igneous rocks such as schist, gneiss, and quartzite and Upspring soils are derived from basic igneous rocks with some pyroclastic material. In addition, Tecopa and Upspring soils do not receive substantial precipitation during the summer months."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Dalvord soils are on mountains, hills, and pediments. Slopes range from 8 to 75 percent. The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from granitoid and gneissic rocks. Elevations range from 579 to 1,555 meters (1,900 to 5,100 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 175 millimeters (4 to 7 inches). The mean annual air temperature is 13 to 20 degrees C (55.5 to 68 degrees F). The frost-free season is 210 to 320 days."

Etinarg soils are found on similar landscape positions at higher elevations, have an argillic horizon and have a mesic soil temperature regime. Goldroad soils are on adjacent south-facing slopes at lower elevations and have a hyperthermic soil temperature regime. Langwell soils are found on similar landscape positions and have loamy particle-size control sections."
