  "OVERVIEW": "The Dutchdan series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  These soils are on mountain ridges.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.",
