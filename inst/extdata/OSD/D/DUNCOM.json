  "STATES": "MT,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Duncom series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from limestone. Duncom soils are on mountains. Slopes are 2 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

(6 to 16 inches thick)\nCk--8 to 14 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) gravelly silt loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; 20 percent limestone gravel and flat fragments; calcareous with some visible secondary calcium carbonate occurring as concretions or in thin seams and streaks and as coatings on the limestone fragments.

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 6 to 16 inches thick and depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Typically, these soils are calcareous from the surface downward but they are leached to depths of 2 or 3 inches in some pedons. Organic carbon in the mollic epipedon ranges from 1 to 2 percent and decreases uniformly with increasing depth. The bulk calcium carbonate equivalent of the whole soil ranges from 10 to 40 percent due to the content of limestone fragments and gravel smaller than 2 millimeters. The control section is gravelly silt loam or loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 60 percent silt, and 15 to 50 percent sand. Rock fragments range from 10 to 35 percent with 0 to 10 percent cobbles or flagstones and 5 to 35 percent gravel or channers.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. Typically, it has granular or crumb structure, but it has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  This horizon is soft to slightly hard. It is slightly to moderately alkaline (pH 7.8 to 8.4), but is typically more alkaline than pH 8.0.\nThe Ck horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR. It is moderately or strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to 8.6) and contains visible accumulations of secondary calcium carbonate."
