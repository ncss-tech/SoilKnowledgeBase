These soils are usually moist, and are dry 30 to 45 consecutive days in the soil moisture control section; udic moisture regime.  Depth to the sandy-skeletal substratum is 14 to 20 inches. particle-size control section has andic soil properties with a cumulative thickness of 14 to 20 inches and 40 to 85 percent rock fragments by volume.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent and 15-bar water retention of 12 to 25 percent for air dried samples, and acid oxalate extractable iron of 1.5 to 3.0 percent.  The lower part (thickest part) of the particle-size control section lacks andic soil properties.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 6 dry.  It has 2 to 5 cmol/kg of aluminum.  It has 5 to 15 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist.  It is very gravelly medial sandy loam, very cobbly medial sandy loam, or extremely gravelly memdial sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately or strongly acid.  It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum.  It has 1 to 7 percent organic matter.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist or dry.
