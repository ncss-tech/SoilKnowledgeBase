Ditchcamp and Snowmore soils have bedrock at 61 to 100 cm. Drysel soils do not have Bqk horizons above the duripan and have soil temperature of 12 to 13 degrees C.  Exel soils have Bt horizons with hue of 7.5YR or 5YR and are slightly acid or neutral.  Hager soils have a lithic contact to tuff at 100 to 150 cm.  Idow do not have Bq horizons above the duripan and do not contain 10 percent durinodes in the Bk horizon.  Rakane soils contain loam and clay loam argillic horizon and so not have a Bqm horizon that contains 10 percent durinodes.  Wako soils do not have Bqk horizon above the duripan and have silty clay loam argillic horizon.  Wendell soils have bedrock at moderate depth."

These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,310 to 1,955 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
