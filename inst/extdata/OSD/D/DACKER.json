  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Dacker series consists of moderately deep over duripan, well drained soils that formed in silty alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  The Dacker soils are on fan piedmont remnants, plateaus, and partial ballenas.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Exel soils have Bt horizons with hue of 7.5YR or 5YR and are slightly acid or neutral.  Hager soils have a lithic contact to tuff at 100 to 150 cm.  Idow do not have Bq horizons above the duripan and do not contain 10 percent durinodes in the Bk horizon.  Rakane soils contain loam and clay loam argillic horizon and so not have a Bqm horizon that contains 10 percent durinodes.  Wako soils do not have Bqk horizon above the duripan and have silty clay loam argillic horizon.  Wendell soils have bedrock at moderate depth."
