  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum is more than 60 inches thick. Small siliceous pebbles range from none to about 10 percent by volume.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR and 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, chroma of 2 through 4. The reaction ranges from medium acid through neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, and 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam with clay content of about 6 to 17 percent. Some pedons contain streaks and pockets of uncoated sand in the lower part. The reaction ranges from medium acid through neutral and increases with depth to moderately alkaline and calcareous in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in the same family. Other competing series are the Apalo, Bastrop, Devol, Duffau, and Springer series. Apalo soils have coarse-silty control sections. Bastrop and Duffau soils have fine-loamy control sections. Devol and Springer soils have mixed mineralogy and are dry in the moisture control section for longer periods."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Decordova soils are on nearly level to undulating stream terraces. Surfaces are plane to convex and undulating. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent, but are dominantly less than 3 percent. The soil formed in thick beds of loamy or sandy alluvial materials on high terraces of the Brazos River which have been reworked by wind. The climate is moist subhumid with average rainfall of 28 to 38 inches and Thornthwaite P-E indices of 44 to 56. The mean annual temperature ranges from 66 degrees to 70 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are competing Apalo and Bastrop series and the Gaddy, Minwells, Paluxy, Pedernales, and Yahola series. Apalo soils are on positions similar to Decordova soils. Bastrop soils are on slightly higher terraces. Gaddy and Yahola soils are stratified alluvial soils below on flood plains. Minwells and Pedernales soils have argillic horizons with more than 35 percent clay and are above on higher terraces or associated uplands. Paluxy soils lack an argillic horizon and are on similar terrace positions."
