  "OVERVIEW": "The Deekay series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary sources.  Deekay soils are on fan remnants, terraces, alluvial fans, plateaus, hills and ridges.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

Augustine, Dermala, Flugle, Goesling, Lykorly, Maia and Pinitos soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section during the 120 days following the winter solstice.  Bigbow soils have buried horizons at depths of less than 40 inches.  Bosonoak soils occur above elevations of 6500 feet and receive most of their precipitation between July and October.  Carri, Celavar, Evpark, Nyjack and Ribera soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Celacy, Elwop, Gateson and Oldwolf soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Dalhart soils have average annual temperatures of 52 to 59 degrees F.  Fort Collins soils are not dry for 45 consecutive days in July through September.  Iwela, Nomrah, Orlie, and Parkelei soils are usually dry in the moisture control section in May and June.
