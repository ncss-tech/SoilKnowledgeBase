  "OVERVIEW": "The Davidell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
