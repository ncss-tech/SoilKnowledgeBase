The depth to horizons, with greater that 90 percent sand and greater than 20 percent rock fragments, ranges from 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches). The thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 0 to 51 cm (0 to 20 inches). The series control section ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the upper part and slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline in the lower part.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam or loam, and less commonly sandy loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bt or 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or loam. Rock fragment content is less than 10 percent.\nBC or 2BC horizon (where present) has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. The Gardenvale, Menomin, Meridian, Merimod, Merit, and Sattre series are in the similar family with superactive cation exchange activity. Gardenvale soils have a paralithic contact within 152 cm (60 inches). Menomin, Meridian, Merimod, Merit and Sattre soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dresden soils are on kames, outwash plains, and stream terraces. Slope gradients range from 0 to 30 percent. These soils formed in 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches) of loamy sediments over calcareous stratified gravel and sand. Some pedons have a silty mantle that ranges from 0 to 51 cm (0 to 20 inches) in thickness. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 12 degrees C (45 to 54 degrees F.), mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1020 cm (30 to 40 inches), frost free days range from 140 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 155 to 311 m (510 to 1020 feet) above mean sea level."
