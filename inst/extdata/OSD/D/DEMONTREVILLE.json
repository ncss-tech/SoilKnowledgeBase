  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 50 inches and depth to the glacial till ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Free carbonates are absent to depths of 60 inches or more. The A and B horizons contain 0 to 10 percent gravel by volume and the 2B and 2C horizons contain from 8 to 20 percent gravel and cobbles of mixed lithology.  The 2B and 2C horizons have moist bulk density ranging from 1.65 to 1.75 gm/cc.  The soil moisture control section is not dry in all parts for 20 to 35 consecutive days during the 120 days following the summer solstice.\nThe A or Ap horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The A and E horizons typically are loamy fine sand or loamy sand but sand or fine sand are in the range.  They are strongly acid through neutral.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon in the upper sediment instead of an E horizon.  It has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand but coarse sand, sand, fine sand, and loamy fine sand are in the range.  It is strongly acid through neutral.\nSome pedons have B/E or 2 B/E horizons, but the E part comprises less than 15 percent of the horizon.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  In some pedons mottles with chroma of 2 are below the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  It is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.  It averages between 6 to 18 percent clay, but parts may range up to 22 percent.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.  It has few through many clay films.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy coarse sand or their gravelly analogues.  It is moderately acid through neutral."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Andrusia (T), Braham, Captom (T), Cutaway, Escanaba, Haskill Pomroy and Redeye soils.  Andrusia soils have friable argillic horizons and are formed in glacial outwash sediments.  Braham soils have hue of 10YR and have more than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Captom soils are dry in the soil moisture control section for more than 35 consecutive days during the 120 days following the summer solstice.  Cutaway soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon, hues yellower than 7.5YR and also have bisequum development.  Escanaba soils have Bs horizons and are dominated by fine sands throughout.  Haskill soils have sand in the lower part of the series control section and below the argillic horizon.  Pomroy and Redeye soils have argillic horizons that formed in dense till which have bulk densities greater than 1.8.  Redby soils also have hue of 10YR or yellower and free carbonates within 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  DeMontreville soils are on summits and upper side slopes of knolls on glacial moraines.  Slopes are plane or convex and slope gradients range from 1 to 45 percent.  These soils formed in a moderately thick sandy mantle of aeolian or lacustrine or outwash sediments and loamy glacial till of the Late Wisconsinan Age.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 24 to 33 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 150.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 670 to 1450 feet."

The well drained Cushing and Kingsley soils occupy similar landscape positions and formed entirely from loamy glacial till.  The excessively drained Mahtomedi soils formed in sandy sediments and are on similar landscapes."
