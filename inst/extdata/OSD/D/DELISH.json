    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 3 inches (A horizon).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 18 and 30 inches at certain times during normal years (part of the Bwb2 horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (C2, Bwb1, and Bwb2 horizons and part of the C'1 horizon).\nThe current classification is based on the assumption that there arent aquic conditions from 40 to 50 cm and that the horizons in the upper part of the profile do not meet the definition of a cambic horizon.  A former taxonomic placement was \"Aquic Xerochrepts\" (1994 Taxonomy) which assumed the presence of a cambic horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
