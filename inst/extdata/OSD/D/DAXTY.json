(42 degrees to 47 degrees F.) and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 15 to 17 degrees C. (59 degrees to 63 degrees F.). These soils are usually moist but are dry throughout between depths of 10 to 30 centimeters (4 and 12 inches) for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The upper 18 to 36 centimeters (7 to 14 inches) has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.85 to 0.95 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 20 to 30 percent for the weighted average of the 0.02 to 2.0 size fraction, and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.2 to 0.4 percent. The particle-size control section has 35 to 75 percent rock fragments and 5 to 18 percent clay. Depth to bedrock is 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches).  Base saturation by NH4OAc is 75 to 90 percent throughout the profile.\nThe particle size control section has fine earth textures of ashy sandy loam or ashy loam. Rock fragments are mainly volcanic tuff flagstones 3 to 5 centimeters (1 to 2 inches) thick and 15 to 38 centimeters (6 to 15 inches) in diameter. Total rock fragments average from 35 to 60 percent.  Channers may occupy up to 30 percent of the control section.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  The fine earth is dominantly ashy loam, but may include ashy silt loam.\nThe Bw and BC horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry."

They formed in colluvium weathered from platy, light colored, and coarse textured acidic volcanic tuff mixed with Mazama volcanic ash throughout. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers with a mean annual precipitation of 43 to 61 centimeters (17 to 24 inches). Slope is 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C. (40 degrees to 45 degrees F.); the mean July temperature is about 15 degrees C. (60 degrees F.), and the mean January temperature is about -2 degrees C. (29 degrees F.) Frost-free period ranges from 20 to 60 days."
