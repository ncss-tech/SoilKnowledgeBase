  "OVERVIEW": "The Diaflats series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum derived from sandstone and siltstone.  Diaflats soils are on plateaus.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 53 to 56 degrees F.  Depth to the lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The soil is commonly calcareous to the surface, but may be leached a few inches in some pedons.  The particle-size control section usually contains 0 to 20 percent rock fragments, but in some pedons a thin horizon immediately above the bedrock containing up to 35 percent rock fragments may occur.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is commonly loam, silt loam, or channery loam, but in some pedons horizons with textures of sandy loam or sandy clay loam occur at variable depths and with variable thicknesses.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
