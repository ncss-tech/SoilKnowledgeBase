  "OVERVIEW": "The Demayo series consists of soils that are shallow to hard basalt bedrock.  They are well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum from basalt lava flows. Demayo soils are on steep ridges and hills on basalt mesas and lava plateaus. Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
