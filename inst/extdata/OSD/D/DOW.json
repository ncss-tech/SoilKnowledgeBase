  "OVERVIEW": "The Dow series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess. These soils are on convex side slopes, summits and saddles of interfluves on dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 5 to 30 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.",
