  "OVERVIEW": "The Dayschool series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium, eolian material, or in slopewash from sandstone.  These soils are on uplands.  Slopes are 15 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
