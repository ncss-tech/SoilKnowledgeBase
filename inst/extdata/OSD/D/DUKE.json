  "OVERVIEW": "The Duke series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium derived from Permian age redbed sediments. These nearly level soils are on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 61 cm (24 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F)",
