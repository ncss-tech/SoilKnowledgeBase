  "OVERVIEW": "The Derby series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy eolian sediments of Pleistocene age.  These are reworked dunes on stream terraces along major streams in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A), and Northern Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A).  Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 914 mm (36 in).",
