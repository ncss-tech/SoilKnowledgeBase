  "REVDATE": "01/2006",
  "STATES": "NJ,PA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Doylestown series consists of deep, poorly drained soils.  These soils formed in silty materials, presumably eolian deposits, over soil materials weathered from a variety of parent materials, but principally red shale.  They are on concave upland slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  Permeability is slow.  Mean annual precipitation is 43 inches, mean annual temperature is 52 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and thickness of the silt mantle ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 3 1/2 to 6 feet.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 15 to 25 inches.  Rock fragments of shale are less than 5 percent in the upper part of the solum and range from 5 to 20 percent in the lower part.  Reaction is very strongly acid and strongly acid in the upper part of the solum and ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the lower part of the solum in unlimed soils.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe B horizon above the fragipan is neutral or has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 0 through 2.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 8.  Texture is silt loam.\nSome pedons have thin unconforming Bx and C horizons which vary widely both in color and texture depending on the material over which the mantle was deposited."

Brinkerton, Sheffield and Thorndale soils have bedrock deeper than 5 feet.  Calvert and Croton soils have sola of less than 40 inches thick.  Ginat soils have mica and a few pebbles in the lower part of the series control section.  Robertsville soils do not have an argillic horizon above the fragipans."

These soils formed in silty materials, presumably eolian, deposited over a wide variety of material weathered from shale, sandstone, limestone, schist and gneiss.  The climate is humid temperate, with mean annual precipitation of 38 to 48 inches, mean annual air temperatures of 50 to 55 degrees F., and a growing season of 170 to 200 days."
