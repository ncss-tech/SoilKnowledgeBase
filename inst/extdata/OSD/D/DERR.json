    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature from 49 to 56 degrees F, under an O horizon.  These soils are usually moist but are dry throughout between 4 and 12 inches more than 60 consecutive days during the summer months.  The solum ranges from slightly acid to neutral.  Depth to lithic contact and shale bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The solum commonly is in 10YR hue but ranges to 7.5YR.  Coarse fragments in the solum are mainly gravel size shale and range from 10 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has values of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry and chromas of 2 or 3.  It is ashy loam or shaly ashy loam.  Thickness of the A horizons ranges from 7 to 18 inches but is not less than 1/3 the thickness of the solum when the solum is 20 to 30 inches thick and is at least 10 inches thick when the solum is 30 to 40 inches thick.\nThe Bw horizon has values of 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chromas of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand."

They have formed from moderately fine textured colluvium and residuum weathered shale bedrock.  The climate is subhumid with a mean annual precipitation of 17 to 24 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 63 degrees F, and the mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from less than 30 days to about 100 days."
