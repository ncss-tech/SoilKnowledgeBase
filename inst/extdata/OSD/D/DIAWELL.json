  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Mickey, Minu, Muni, and Zadvar series.  Mickey soils have duripans 15 to 25 inches thick and lack carbonates above the duripan.  Minu soils are intermittently moist in summer due to summer convection storms and are calcareous in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Muni soils have a 10 to 36 inch thick duripan and average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Zadvar soils are 10 to 14 inches deep to a duripan.  In addition, Mickey and Zadvar soils are moist for 10 to 20 days during the summer."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Diawell soils are nearly level to rolling fan on dissected fan piedmonts at elevations of 3,200 to 4,200 feet.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium from intermediate intrusive rocks and vitric tuff.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 11 inches.  Average annual temperature ranges from 48 to 51 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 110 to 135 days."
