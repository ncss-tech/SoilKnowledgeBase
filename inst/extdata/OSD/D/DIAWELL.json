  "OVERVIEW": "The Diawell series consists of shallow to duripan, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in mixed alluvium from intermediate intrusive rocks and vitric tuff.  Diawell soils are on dissected fan piedmonts.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Minu soils are intermittently moist in summer due to summer convection storms and are calcareous in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Muni soils have a 10 to 36 inch thick duripan and average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Zadvar soils are 10 to 14 inches deep to a duripan.  In addition, Mickey and Zadvar soils are moist for 10 to 20 days during the summer."
