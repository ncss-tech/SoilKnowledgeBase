  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact of weathered rock is 25 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 55 to 59 degrees F.  The soil between depths of about 5 and 15 inches usually is continually dry in all parts from late May or June until some time in October and is moist in the same or all parts all the rest of the year.  Some pedons have as much as 10 percent rock fragments in some or all horizons.  Some pedons have 0 5 to 5 percent of the surface covered by stones or cobblestones without stones lower in the profile.\nThe A horizon is very pale brown or light brownish gray to brown (10YR 6/2, 6/3, 7/3, 6/4, 5/2; 7 5YR 6/2, 6/4, 5/2 ).  Moist values are two units lower.  Dry value of 5 and moist value of 3 is confined to the upper 3 to 7 inches in those pedons having these values.  The A horizon is sandy loam to very fine sandy loam.  It has weak or moderate granular or medium to fine subangular blocky structure or the A horizon is massive in some or all parts.  The A horizon is slightly to very strongly acid.  Its lower boundary is gradual or clear and in addition some pedons have a transitional A3 or B1 horizon.\nThe B2t horizon is very pale brown to reddish yellow (10YR 7/2, 7/3, 7/4, 8/4, 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 6/4, 7/4, 7/6, 5/6, 5/8.)  Some pedons have coarse blotches of redder color (5YR 5/6 or 5/8).  The B2t horizon is heavy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  It has weak angular blocky or weak to moderate subangular blocky structure or the horizon is massive in some or all parts.  This horizon is strongly or very strongly acid and has base saturation of about 20 to 35 percent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Goldridge, Josephine, Lyonsville and Stump Springs series.  Goldridge soils lack a paralithic contact and lack strong brown colors and dry value or 6 or 7 in the B2t horizon.  Josephine soils have a paralithic contact 40 to 60 inches below the surface.  Lyonsville soils have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 47 degrees F.  Stump Springs soils have an abrupt A-B2t horizon boundary and a base saturation of more than 35 percent in the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Diamond Springs soils are on gentle to steep slopes at elevations of 1,000 to 4,000 feet.  They formed in residuum weathered from fine grained metamorphosed acid igneous and rhyolitic rocks.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 30 to 50 inches, much of which is rain.  The mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F., average January temperature about 41 degrees F., and average July temperature about 66 degrees F.  The freeze-free season is about 140 to 240 days."

Auberry soils have a base saturation of 50 to 75 percent and a paralithic contact 40 to 60 inches below the surface.  Auburn soils have a lithic contact less than 20 inches below the surface.  Boomer soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the argillic horizon.  Chaix, Goulding and Kanaka soils lack an argillic horizon and Goulding soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments."
