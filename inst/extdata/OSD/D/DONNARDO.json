  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Rock fragments in the particle-size control section range from 35 to 70 percent, and range from gravel to stones.  There are layers of cobbles or stones in some part of the series control section.  Depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 8 to 19 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 64 to 66 degrees F.  The moisture control section is dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days during the summer and moist for 60 to 70 consecutive days during the 120 days after the winter solstice.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline, and slightly calcareous to strongly calcareous.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly loam, very cobbly loam, very stony loam, extremely stony loam or very cobbly sandy loam.  It is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline, and contains 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICAL SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICAL SETTING:  Donnardo soils are on moderately sloping to moderately steep alluvial fans.  They formed in alluvium from sandstone, limestone and shale.  These soils occur at elevations of 4,500 to 6,600 feet and are on south or west exposures above 6,200 feet.  Slopes are 2 to 40 percent.  The climate is dry subhumid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F. Freeze-free period is 110 to 150 days."

Birdow and Keigley soils lack calcic horizons, and have less than 35 percent rock fragments.  Borvant, Denmark and Pavant soils have petrocalcic horizons at depths of less than 20 inches.  Collard, Doyce and Mountainville soils have argillic horizons."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 15 inches.  A1, A2, and A3 horizons)\nCalcic horizon - the zone of calcium carbonate accumulation from 15 to 60 inches. (Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons)\nIn July 1995 the classification was changed from Aridic Calcixeroll to Typic Calcixeroll.  This was based on the precipitation of up to 16 inches per year, the Upland range site and dry matter production.  As a result of this classification change the Sterling series and Donnardo series are in the same family and it appears that Utah had two series to accomodate the same concept. This was not recognized because they were under two classifications.  At this time it is inappropriate to drop one of the series because they have both been correlated in a number of surveys.  In reviewing each of the 9 survey type locations there appears to be a natural separation between the pedons confined to gravel sized rock fragments and and the pedons that contain cobble or stone sized fragments.  This would provide suitable series differentia and it results in significant interpretive differences.  In updating surveys some units of Sterling would be recorrelated to Donnardo.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Lakewood MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
