It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline, and slightly calcareous to strongly calcareous.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 15 inches.  A1, A2, and A3 horizons)\nCalcic horizon - the zone of calcium carbonate accumulation from 15 to 60 inches. (Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons)\nIn July 1995 the classification was changed from Aridic Calcixeroll to Typic Calcixeroll.  This was based on the precipitation of up to 16 inches per year, the Upland range site and dry matter production.  As a result of this classification change the Sterling series and Donnardo series are in the same family and it appears that Utah had two series to accomodate the same concept. This was not recognized because they were under two classifications.  At this time it is inappropriate to drop one of the series because they have both been correlated in a number of surveys.  In reviewing each of the 9 survey type locations there appears to be a natural separation between the pedons confined to gravel sized rock fragments and and the pedons that contain cobble or stone sized fragments.  This would provide suitable series differentia and it results in significant interpretive differences.  In updating surveys some units of Sterling would be recorrelated to Donnardo.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Lakewood MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
