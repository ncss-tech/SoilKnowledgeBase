    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 degrees to 53 degrees F. Faint mottles commonly occur at depths below 28 inches and above 40 inches. In some pedons th soil profile contains 5 to 10 percent fine gravel.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3. Organic matter is about 3 to 5 percent in the A horizon, and decreases irregularly with increasing depth. Reaction ranges from neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Stratification occurs in the C horizon, with buried A horizons common. Calcium carbonate content is variable, ranging from a trace to moderately calcareous, and commonly occurs below depth of 20 inches.  Reaction ranges from mildly to moderately alkaline."
