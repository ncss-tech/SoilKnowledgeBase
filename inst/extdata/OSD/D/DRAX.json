  "OVERVIEW": "The Drax series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in material weathered from mixed alluvium derived mainly from acid igneous rocks and loess. Drax soils are on low terraces and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

In some pedons th soil profile contains 5 to 10 percent fine gravel.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3. Organic matter is about 3 to 5 percent in the A horizon, and decreases irregularly with increasing depth. Reaction ranges from neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Stratification occurs in the C horizon, with buried A horizons common. Calcium carbonate content is variable, ranging from a trace to moderately calcareous, and commonly occurs below depth of 20 inches.  Reaction ranges from mildly to moderately alkaline."
