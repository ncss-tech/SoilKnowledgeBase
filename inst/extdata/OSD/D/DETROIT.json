Allowed it to occur on upland.  Corrected runoff to match SSM Table 3-10.\n7/11 JGA\nUpdated format of the OSD, added metric conversions, and added saturated hydraulic conductivity. Added type location description date. Updated terminology of iron accumulation to masses of oxidized iron. Added quadrangle, latitude, and longitude from the description.  Updated soil moisture regime to ustic bordering on udic. Added soil temp regime and mean annual soil temp. Lowered depth to secondary carbonates to 65 centimeters based on field data and to fix an overlap with a competing series. Added clay and sand content and particle control section.  Added clay and sand content to horizons in range and characteristics. Changed format of geographic setting to tabular. Lowered mean annual sir temp to 11 degrees C and increased mean annual precipitation to 850 millimeters based on climate data. Changed permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity. Updated competing series, geographically associated soils, remarks, and additional data sections. Added keys to soil taxonomy edition. Changed precipitation values from centimeters to millimeters.\n10/2014 DJK\nUpdated lat/long of type location using legal description to put it in the right section. Added AB ranges to RIC. Added moderately acid for range of Ap. Added value of 4 for moist color and slightly acid for reaction to Bt. Added redox and CCE to BC and C range. Deleted Crete from competing series. Changed low MAP from 20\" to 22\". Added precipitation pattern. Changed runoff to fit SSM table 3-10 for moderately low Ksat on 0 to 2 percent slopes.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Physical and chemical data for this pedon are available from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska pedon: 79KS169001 (sample numbers 79P1679-79P1686).
