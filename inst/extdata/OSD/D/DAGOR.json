    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F., and the average summer soil temperature is about 70 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the 4 to 12 inch depth for more than 60 consecutive days in 7 out of 10 years.\nThe mollic epipedon is more than 20 inches thick and the organic matter content does not decrease regularly with depth or remain at a level of more than 0.5 percent to a depth 50 inches.  The average texture of the control section is loam or silt loam containing 18 to 27 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon  has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has 3 to 7 percent organic matter.  It has weak very fine to coarse granular or subangular blocky structure or it may be weak platy in the surface 3 inches and the lower part may be weak prismatic.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have Bw horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is fine sandy loam to clay loam and is stratified. It has weak prismatic or very weak subangular blocky structure or is massive. It is very hard to slightly hard, friable, sticky or slightly sticky and plastic or slightly plastic.  It is neutral to mildly alkaline."

Blackrock soils have 20 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Burgi, Pleasant View and Redola soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Coit soils are calcareous, are saturated above depths of 40 inches for 3 months or more during most years and have mottles in the series control section.  Eld soils are medium to slightly acid.  Goose Creek soils are moderately fine textured and are moderately well or imperfectly drained, with a fluctuating water table commonly at 3 to 4.5 feet.  Harpt soils have dry value of more than 4 in the A horizon and more than 5 in the C horizon.  Keigley soils contain less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Lakeview soils have chroma of 0 or 1 in the A horizon and have 25 to 35 percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section.  Packard soils are medium acid in the B horizon.  Willowdale soils have a Ck horizon and are usually calcareous throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dagor soils occur on smooth to undulating, nearly level, to steep, intermittent stream valleys and alluvial fans with slopes of 0 to 20 percent. Elevation is 4300 to 5200 feet in Utah and ranges to 2,500 feet in Idaho. These soils formed in alluvium from mixed parent rocks.  The climate is dry subhumid with an average annual precipitation of 12 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 65 to 73 degrees F.  The frost free season is 100 to 170 days."

Kilburn soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick and are very gravelly and cobbly in the control section.  Timpanogos soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick, have argillic horizons and strong lime horizons."
