  "OVERVIEW": "The Dedrick series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from metavolcanic rocks or sometimes mica schist.  They are on mountains.  Mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.  Slope is 50 to 90 percent.",
