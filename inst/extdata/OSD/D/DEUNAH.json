  "OVERVIEW": "The Deunah series consists of moderately deep to duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and eolian material derived mainly from basalt and volcanic ash.  Deunah soils are on tablelands, piedmonts, hills and plateaus and have slopes of 1 to 10 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
