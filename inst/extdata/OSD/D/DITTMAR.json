  "OVERVIEW": "The Dittmar series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in tephra and residuum from volcanic rock. Dittmar soils are on scoured glacial-valley walls. Slopes range from 20 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 51 inches (1295 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F (6 degrees C).",
