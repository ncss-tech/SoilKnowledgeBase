  "OVERVIEW": "The Drymesa series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and eolian deposits over residuum weathered from calcareous sandstone and shale.  Drymesa soils are on structural benches.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 267 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8.5 degrees C.",
