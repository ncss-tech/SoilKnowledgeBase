  "OVERVIEW": "The Dimmick series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey sediments.  These soils are in depressions on uplands and in lake basins and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 41 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 16 inches.",

The soil moisture control section is saturated for up to 21 days beyond the summer solstice in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  It is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam and is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have ABk or Bk horizons.\nThe BCg and Cg horizons have hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 0 to 3.  They are clay or silty clay, but some pedons have strata of silty clay loam or sandy clay loam.  They are neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons do not have a BCg horizon.  Some pedons are loam, silt loam or silty clay loam below 40 inches."
