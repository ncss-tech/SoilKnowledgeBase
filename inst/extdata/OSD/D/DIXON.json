The soil is above 41 degrees F., from about March 15 to about November 15.  The soil is dry from 8 to 21 inches from about June 15 to about October 15. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F.  Depth to the 2C horizon is 30 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments in the upper part of the particle-size control section range from 5 to 25 percent and in the lower part form 40 to 70 percent.  The rock fragments are dominantly gravel.  Clay in the upper part of the particle-size control section ranges from 20 to 35 percent and in the lower part form 0 to 10 percent.   There is more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the upper part of the particle-size control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 1 to 2 percent organic matter.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  It is clay loam, sandy clay loam, or gravelly sandy clay loam.  It is slightly to strongly effervescent.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It is very or extremely gravelly loamy sand above 40 inches; it is very gravelly loamy sand, extremely gravelly loamy sand, or very gravelly sandy loam below 40 inches.  It is massive or single grained below 40 inches."
