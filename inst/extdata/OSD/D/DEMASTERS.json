  "OVERVIEW": "The Demasters series consists of deep or very deep, well drained, soils on hills and mountains. They formed in residuum or colluvium from basalt or other basic igneous rocks. Slope ranges from 3 to 90 percent. Permeability is moderate. The average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 20 inches.",

The climate is cool subhumid, with an average annual temperature of 41 to 45 degrees F, and with an average annual precipitation of 17 to 24 inches including 5 to 10 feet of snow. Summers are moderately dry. The average frost-free period is 80 to 140 days."

All of the above named soils, except for Suloaf, are on ridgetops, plateaus, or steep slopes with southerly aspects. Suloaf soils are on plateaus and steep northerly mountain slopes."
