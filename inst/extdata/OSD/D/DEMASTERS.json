  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Demasters soils are usually on north exposures of undulating to very steep hills, canyons, and mountains. Slopes range from 3 to 90 percent. The soils formed in colluvium or residuum from basalt or other basic igneous rock at elevations of 3,000 to 6,000 feet. The climate is cool subhumid, with an average annual temperature of 41 to 45 degrees F, and with an average annual precipitation of 17 to 24 inches including 5 to 10 feet of snow. Summers are moderately dry. The average frost-free period is 80 to 140 days."

All of these soils are mollic, but not pachic, except for the Waha series. The Waha series is pachic but not ultic. All of the above named soils, except for Suloaf, are on ridgetops, plateaus, or steep slopes with southerly aspects. Suloaf soils are on plateaus and steep northerly mountain slopes."
