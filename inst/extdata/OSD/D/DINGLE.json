  "OVERVIEW": "The Dingle series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in organic material over lake sediments. These soils are on lakebeds and lake terraces. Permeability is moderately slow. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
