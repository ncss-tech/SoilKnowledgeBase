The Berner soils have loamy till at 30 to 55 inches, and have sandy sediments between the organic material and the till.

The Nidaros soils have A horizons below the organic material and has sandy 2Cg horizons. The Wonsqueak soils do not have free carbonates in the mineral soil, are very strongly acid to neutral in the C horizon, and have a mean annual precipitation of 35 to 55 inches."
