They are distinguished by being permanently covered by estuarine waters that support submersed aquatic vegetation.   The initial name proposed for this series was Wallops.  Refer to Ph.D. dissertations on file at the University of Maryland, College Park, MD.  (1) Subaqueous Soil Survey of Sinepuxent Bay, Maryland; George P. Demas, July 1998.  And (2) Pedogenesis, Inventory, and Utilization of Subaqueous Soils in Chincoteague Bay, Maryland by Danielle M. Balduff, 2007.\nDiagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 9 inches (0 to 22 centimeters) (Ase horizons)\nPeraquic feature--the zone from 0 to 85 inches (0 to 215 centimeters) is permanently saturated\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nData Map Unit ID: 679290\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
