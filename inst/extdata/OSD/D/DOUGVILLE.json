One or more subhorizons in the top 30 inches of the profile, including the surface horizon in all cases, has less than 75 percent base saturation by sum of cations.  Clay content in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon ranges from 8 to 18 percent with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.

The semi-arid climate is characterized by warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Average January temperature is 26 degrees F., average July temperature is 70 degrees F., and average annual temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 110 to 165 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are a mollic epipedon from the surface to 26 inches, 15 to 20 percent sand-size pumice from 0 to 39 inches with an estimated volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, and a coarse-silty argillic horizon from 39 to 57 inches.  A zone of carbonate accumulation is from 57 to 60 inches. Base saturation by sum of the cations is less than 75 percent from 0 to 8 inches.\nThis description reflects a change in type location and classification from coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Aridic Haploxerolls to coarse-silty, mixed, mesic Vitrandic Argixerolls. The particle-size control section is the zone from 39 to 57 inches (the 2Bt horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL lab data is available for this soil, NSSL pedon numbers 89P0219, 87P0501 and 90P1014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
