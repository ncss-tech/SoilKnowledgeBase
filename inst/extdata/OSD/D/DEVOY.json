  "OVERVIEW": "The Devoy series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rock.  Devoy soils are on mountains and plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
