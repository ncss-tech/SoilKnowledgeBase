  "OVERVIEW": "The Dechambeau series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium influenced by volcanic ash.  Dechambeau soils are on alluvial fans and lakeshore terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
