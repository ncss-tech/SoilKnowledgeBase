  "OVERVIEW": "The Dowagiac series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy outwash overlying sand or gravelly sand outwash on outwash plains, terraces, and valley trains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).",
