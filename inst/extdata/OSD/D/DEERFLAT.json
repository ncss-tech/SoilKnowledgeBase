  "OVERVIEW": "The Deerflat series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from phyllite, schist, and other metasedimentary rocks. The Deerflat soils are on hills and in canyons. Slopes range from 3 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 805 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C.",
