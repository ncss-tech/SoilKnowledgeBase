  "OVERVIEW": "The Dedmount series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine sediments derived from mixed rocks.  Dedmount soils are on alluvial flats and dissected lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
