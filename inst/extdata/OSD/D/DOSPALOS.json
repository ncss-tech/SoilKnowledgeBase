    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are saturated with stagnant water for at least a few days. The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to 33 inches, primarily because of land leveling. The 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay but can range from 35 to 60 percent clay. Organic matter content is 1 and 3 percent in the upper 24 inches and decreases regularly with depth. The soil has less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent content throughout and typically decreases with depth. Surface cracks range from 0.75 to 1 inch and decrease to 0.5 to 0.75 inch at 20 inches of depth. There are no sphenoids or intersecting slickensides. Salinity is typically less than 2 decisiemens per meter but is 4 to 16 decisiemens per meter throughout in some pedons. It is slightly to strongly effervescent with disseminated carbonates from a depth of 10 inches to over 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 2/1, 3/1, 4/1, 5/3; N 4/0; 2.5Y 4/2; 5Y 4/1, 5/1, 6/1 or 3/2.

It is slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent with disseminated carbonates below a depth of 10 inches.\nThe Bwg horizon has color of 5Y 6/1, 6/2 or 6/3. Moist color is 10YR 4/3, 5/3; 5Y 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3 or 2.5Y 4/2. Texture is clay loam or clay. Clay content typically is 35 to 60 percent. Sodium adsorption ratio averages less than 3 but ranges up to 12. It is slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent with disseminated carbonates.\nThe C horizon has color of 10YR 5/2, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3; 2.5Y 5/4, 5/6, 6/4; 5Y 5/2, 5/3, 6/1, 6/2 or 6/3.

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dospalos soils are in valley basins. Slope is 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in mixed alluvium mostly from granitic rocks. Most of these soils have been land leveled, but were hummocky in their natural landscape. Elevation is 60 to 120 feet. The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. The mean annual temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F. Frost-free season is 210 to 280 days."

Escano and Kesterson soils, on valley basins, have a fine-loamy particle-size control section and a calcic horizon. Palazzo soils, on valley basin floors and flood plains, have a fine-loamy particle-size control section and organic matter that decreases irregularly with depth."

These soils were previously ponded with stagnant water for extended periods during winter and spring months and are now ponded for periods of 2 to 7 days from December to February. The water table is now 3 to 5 feet December through March. They are now artificially drained or have had their water source intercepted. Most areas are protected from major flooding by large flood control levees and reservoirs."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly included with and surveyed as the Merced series in the Los Banos Area, series 1939 report. These soils are being differentiated by characteristics that show a reducing environment (Aquic Moisture Regime), a thick epipedon and wide cracking which are not characteristic of the Merced series. pH determined by colorimetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Truog Triplex indicators. Texture determined by modified Bouyoucos method. Sodium adsorption ratio determined by versenate method.\nDospalos soil is mapped as a taxadjunct in the Fresno County, California, Western Part Soil Survey. It differs from Dospalos series by having intersecting slickensides in the upper part of the B horizon and by having mean annual precipitation of 8 to 9 inches. Dospalos taxadjunct has NSSl lab data available approximately 1.5 miles south of the Merced County line, for pedon sample number S87CA019-015 (1489-1497). Further investigation of the Dospalos series is warranted to determine if this series should be in the Vertisol soil order. Evidence for this change would include the COLE values of pedon S87CA-019-015 located close to Merced County, California, Western Part Soil Survey. Other evidence includes sidewalks that have been displaced by the cracking and heaving of soil mapped as Dospalos series in the town of Dos Palos. There are many areas with large cracks several inches apart.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
