These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from quartzite, chert, and volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 2,290 to 2,900 meters.  The climate is cold, semiarid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm; mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is less than 50 days."
