  "OVERVIEW": "The Delmo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed granitic and volcanic rocks.  Delmo soils are on fan remnants on mountain valleys.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
