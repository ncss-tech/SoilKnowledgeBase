The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Field estimated clay content is 5 to 15 percent throughout.  Depth to glacial till is 10 to 20 inches.  The upper part of the particle size control section contains 50 to 80 percent volcanic glass and glass-coated aggregates and the lower part contains 30 to 60 percent.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Oi horizon is 1 to 3 inches thick, except where disturbed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, chroma of 2 or 3 moist in the A1, 3 or 4 moist in the A2, and 3 or 4 dry.  It contains 10 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones.  Total rock fragments range from 10 to 40 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is ashy loamy sand or ashy sandy loam.  It contains 10 to 30 percent gravel, 15 to 35 percent cobbles, and 10 to 30 percent stones.  Total rock fragments range from 40 to 70 percent."

Goatrock soils have an umbric epipedon, are dry for 15 to 25 days and the texture (fine earth) of the ash mantle is silt loam.  Joebaldy soils have an umbric epipedon and fragmental material at 20 to 40 inches.  Longjohn soils have an umbric epipedon and are strongly or very strongly acid throughout.  Haynap soils have rock fragments which are cinders."

The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 70 inches, falling mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 35 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 10 to 80 days."
