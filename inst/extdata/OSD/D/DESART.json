It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is very fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand or fine sand.  It has or parts to weak fine to coarse platy structure.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have E/B or B/E horizons.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.  It has strong medium to very coarse columnar structure.  It is strongly alkaline.  Carbonates and salts, in the form of crystals, threads or masses are in the lower Bt horizon in some pedons.\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon up to 20 inches thick.  Where present, it has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loamy fine sand, fine sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Desart soils are on level to moderately sloping terraces, fans and uplands.  Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent.  The soils formed in moderately coarse textured alluvium or residuum.  The climate is semiarid with a mean annual temperature ranging from 40 degrees to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranging from 13 to 18 inches. Most of the precipitation falls in the spring and summer months."

Ekalaka soils are in complex with Desart soils on convex, slightly higher lying nearby positions.  Flasher soils are shallow soils on nearby steep hills and side slopes.  Parshall, Tally and Vebar soils are on adjacent terraces and uplands and do not have natric horizons."
