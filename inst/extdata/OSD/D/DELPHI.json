  "OVERVIEW": "The Delphi series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in continental glacial till.  Delphi soils are on glacial uplands with slopes of 3 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 60 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 190 days.",
