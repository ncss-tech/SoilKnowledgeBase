These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice in 7 years out of 10.  The control section is silt loam or loam modified by 35 to 70 rock fragments.\nThe A and AB horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5 YR moist and 7.5YR or 10 YR dry, value of 4 or 5 dry, chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  The AB horizon is very gravelly sit loam or very gravelly loam.  The A horizons are medium acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR moist and value of 4 through 6 dry.  it is very gravelly sit loam, very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly loam or extremely gravelly silt loam.\nThe 2Bqm horizon is compact and weakly cemented extremely gravelly clay loam or extremely gravelly loam in the upper few feet and extremely gravelly loamy sand in the lower part."
