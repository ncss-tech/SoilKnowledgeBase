    "content": "REMARKS: Danripple soils were previously mapped as Masada soils. Division of MLRA 136 into mesic and thermic areas necessitated the addition of this series. These soils formed in old alluvium derived from soils weathered from a mixture of felsic and mafic metamorphic and igneous rocks.  Revision dated 03/09, allows a flooding class of none-DTA.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 10 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 10 to 48 inches (Bt horizon)\nOther soil features identified with this pedon:\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory Data: No laboratory data available.\nDatabase Information: Typical Pedon Data Mapunit ID--103338\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
