These soils formed in old alluvium derived from soils weathered from a mixture of felsic and mafic metamorphic and igneous rocks.  Revision dated 03/09, allows a flooding class of none-DTA.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 10 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 10 to 48 inches (Bt horizon)\nOther soil features identified with this pedon:\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory Data: No laboratory data available.\nDatabase Information: Typical Pedon Data Mapunit ID--103338\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
