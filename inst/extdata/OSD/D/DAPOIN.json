  "REVDATE": "05/2017",
  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Dapoin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived from shale. These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, mountain slopes, landslides, drainageways and swales. Slopes are from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 558 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 5.5 degrees C.",
