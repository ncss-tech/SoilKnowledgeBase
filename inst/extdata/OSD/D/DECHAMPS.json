The finer textured stratifications are the thinnest strata.  The sand content of any of the stratified layers is always greater than 40 percent, and the weighted average sand content is always above 70 percent.  Very fine sand is abundant, but is never greater than 40 percent of the sand fraction.  Clay content is usually about 5 to 10 percent, except it may be higher in thin or very thin layers.\nRedoximorphic features: Redox depletions above 20 inches\nReaction: moderately acid to slightly alkaline"
