  "OVERVIEW": "The Dechamps series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in predominantly sandy alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains.  Permeability is moderate to rapid.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The finer textured stratifications are the thinnest strata.  The sand content of any of the stratified layers is always greater than 40 percent, and the weighted average sand content is always above 70 percent.  Very fine sand is abundant, but is never greater than 40 percent of the sand fraction.  Clay content is usually about 5 to 10 percent, except it may be higher in thin or very thin layers.\nRedoximorphic features: Redox depletions above 20 inches\nReaction: moderately acid to slightly alkaline"
