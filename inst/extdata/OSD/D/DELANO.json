They formed from deep coarse-textured alluvium from granitoid rock sources. The climate is arid (desert) with hot dry summers and cool winters. Elevations are 300 to 700 feet (91.4 to 213.4 meters). Mean annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches (15 to 23 centimeters). Average January temperature is 46 degrees F. (7.7 degrees C.); average July temperature is 83 degrees F. (28.3 degrees C.); mean annual temperature is 64 degrees F (17.8 degrees C.). Frost-free season is about 260 to 290 days."

Since there is considerate overlap with the Delano, Milham, and other series they probably should be made inactive.\nSeries reclassified on September, 1994.
