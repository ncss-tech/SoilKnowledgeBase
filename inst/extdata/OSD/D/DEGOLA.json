Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 52 inches.\nThe A horizons has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 5 and chroma of 1 to 3.  Gray colors are not considered to be due to wetness.  Texture of the A1 horizon is dominantly clay loam, but ranges to loam.  Texture of the A2 and A3 horizons is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw, or BC horizon where present, have hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 1 to 3.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  There are stratified layers with evident bedding planes.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Textures of fine sandy loam to sandy clay occur in some pedons.  Structure ranges from massive to weak subangular blocky. Calcium carbonate, in the form of masses and concretions, range from none to common.  Siliceous pebbles range from none to 5 percent by volume.  Electrical conductivity ranges from 0 to 8 dS/m in the lower part."

Ramadero soils are dry in the moisture control section for longer periods.  Sinton soils are moderately alkaline and calcareous throughout.  Bippus, Bosque, Gageby, and Gowen soils are in the thermic family.  Laredo soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick and are in the fine-silty family.  Odem soils are in the coarse-loamy family.  Pimer soils are in the fine-silty family. Sinton soils are moderately alkaline and calcareous throughout."
