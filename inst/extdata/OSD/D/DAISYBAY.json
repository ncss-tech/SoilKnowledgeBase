  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to clayey material ranges from 16 to 51 inches. Wood fragment content in the organic layers averages less than 15 percent by volume. Reaction is 4.5 or greater (in 0.01 M calcium chloride) in some part of the organic materials.\nThe surface tier is typically peat (fibric material) in at least the upper part. In some pedons it is mucky peat. Oi layers are derived primarily from sphagnum moss. The Oi layers have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 2 to 7 and chroma of 2 to 4. They are extremely acid. Oe layers that occur in the surface tier are extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe subsurface tier is dominantly mucky peat (hemic material). It is derived primarily from herbaceous plants. The Oe layers have hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 to 4. They are extremely acid to strongly acid. Layers of muck (sapric material) commonly occur within the subsurface tier and have a combined thickness of less than 10 inches. Oa horizons have hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 or 2. They are very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have A horizons. Hue is 5Y, 2.5Y or 10YR, value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 1 or 2. Texture is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay or their mucky analogues. They are moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam or clay loam. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 8 percent by volume. Calcium carbonate content is 0 to 5 percent.\nBCd or Cd horizons occur below 60 inches in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Daisybay soils are on flats and in depressions on moraines, till plains, and glacial lake plains. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. They formed in organic materials over clayey till or lacustrine sediments. Mean annual air temperature is 36 to 41 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 25 to 30 inches. The frost-free period is 90 to 125 days. Elevation above sea level is 1200 to 1600 feet."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alango(T), Brickton, Buhl, Dalbo, Fayal, Greenwood, Hibbing, Indus, McQuade and Taylor soils. Somewhat poorly drained Alango and Buhl soils are on higher lying slightly convex positions. Poorly drained Brickton, Indus and McQuade soils are on adjacent nearly level positions. Very poorly drained Fayal soils do not have organic materials in the upper part that are as much as 16 inches thick. Very poorly drained Greenwood soils formed in organic material more than 51 inches thick. Moderately well drained Dalbo, Hibbing and Taylor soils are on nearby backslopes and convex rises."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. Runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate or moderately rapid in the organic material and very slow in the clayey material. Seasonal high saturation is at a depth of 0 to 1 foot at some time during the months of April through June and October through November in normal years.\nPonding can occur on these soils, especially during snow melt and heavy rains."
