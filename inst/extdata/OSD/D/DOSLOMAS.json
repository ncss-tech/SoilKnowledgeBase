  "OVERVIEW": "The Doslomas series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from metamorphic and igneous rock.  Doslomas soils are on stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
