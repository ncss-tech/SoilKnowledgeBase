  "OVERVIEW": "The Dement series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from sedimentary rocks.  Dement soils are on mountains and have slopes of 2 to 70 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 65 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist, but have a short dry period of less than 45 consecutive days during the summer.  Up to 15 percent gravel are in the lower part of the solum.  The solum thickness and depth to soft bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It has moderate or strong granular, or very fine or fine subangular blocky structure.  Forested areas commonly have a 1- to 4-inch thick O horizon.  It is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR moist and 5YR or 7.5YR dry, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay and is 35 to 45 percent clay.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe 2Cr horizon is siltstone or sandstone in various stages of weathering.  Fragments are often separated and mixed with silty clay material.  Red iron stains coat vertical and horizontal fracture planes."

Blachly soils are deeper than 80 inches to bedrock and have more than 45 percent clay in the Bt horizon.  Desolation soils have formed in colluvium from basalt.  The particle-size control section has 5 to 35 percent rock fragments.  The lower part of the subsoil (below 40 inches) has 35 to 75 percent rock fragments.  Kilowan soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Melby soils have hue of 7.5YR moist in the Bw horizon.  Willaby soils have 15 to 60 percent rounded gravel and cobbles in the lower 2B horizon."

The marine climate is characterized by cool moist winters and mild dry summers.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F, mean January temperature is about 44 degrees F, and mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 55 to 80 inches.
