  "OVERVIEW": "The Duel series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in sandy drift overlying limestone bedrock on till plains and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",
