Permeability is moderately rapid to rapid in the sandy-skeletal alluvium and very slow in the dense loamy till.  These soils have a perched seasonal water table above the densic contact at a depth of 2 to 3.5 feet from April to June in most years. This soil is rarely flooded, but a non-flooded phase is recognized."
