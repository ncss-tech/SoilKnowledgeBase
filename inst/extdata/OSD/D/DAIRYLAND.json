  "OVERVIEW": "The Dairyland series consists of very deep moderately well drained soils that formed mostly in sandy-skeletal alluvium over dense loamy till on flood plains and stream terraces.  Permeability is rapid in the sandy-skeletal alluvium and very slow in the dense loamy till.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
