Gestrin soils have grayish redox depletions in the lower part of the series control section. Blaquirre soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inch depth. Boze soils are isotic and have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. Gestrin soils are moderately well drained and have mottles between depths of 40 and 60 inches. Josie soils have less than 20 percent base saturation in the cambic horizon and have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. Longval and Rarick soils are paramicaeous and have a lithic contact above depth of 40 inches. Suttler soils are strongly acid and have clayey lamellae in the B horizon. Weitas soils have a lithological discontinuity."
