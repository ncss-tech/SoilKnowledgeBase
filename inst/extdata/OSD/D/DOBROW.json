  "OVERVIEW": "The Dobrow series consists of poorly to very poorly drained soils formed in moderately coarse textured alluvial sediments overlying sand and gravel beds.  Dobrow soils are on flood plains and slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 255 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.",
