  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:   Mean annual soil temperature is about 42 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature is about 56 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 21 to 40 inches thick.  Usually the mollic epipedon rests directly on the sandy-skeletal substratum, but mottled B2 horizons of low chroma occur below the mollic epipedon in some pedons.  O horizons are usually present but are thin.  The soil is 60 to 100 percent base saturated.  Depth to the noncontrasting IIC horizon ranges from 26 to 40 inches.  Texture of the control section is typically a sandy loam averages 5 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 40 percent silt, and 50 to 82 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in a major part of the control section above the IIC horizon and are mainly 1/4 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 and has common distinct to many prominent mottles.  It ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe B2 horizon, if present, has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of neutral through 2, and has common distinct to many prominent mottles.  It ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline."

The soils formed in moderately coarse textured alluvial sediments overlying sand and gravel beds.  At the type location these soils occur at elevations of 8,000 feet or higher.  Average annual precipitation is approximately 10 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer.  The average annual temperature is 36 degrees F and the mean temperature is 56 degrees F."
