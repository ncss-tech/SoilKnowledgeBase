  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are saturated with water during the winter and spring unless artificially drained. Soil depth is more than 5 feet but rooting depth is restricted by seasonal water table of less than 30 inches. Depth to fragipan is 20 to 30 inches. Mean annual soil temperature is 51 degrees to 55 degrees F.  Umbric epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It has granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 moist and 1 or 2 dry.  Redox concentrations are distinct or prominent. The texture is commonly silty clay loam but includes silt loam in the upper part in some pedons.\nThe 2Btx horizon (fragipan) has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. The coatings on peds and tongues have the lower chroma and yellower hue. This horizon is firm or very firm and commonly brittle clay films are common to many and faint to distinct in pores and on cleavage planes or polygonal cracks."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Delena soils are in concave swales and draws on smooth or rolling hills at 100 to 1,400 foot elevations. The soils formed in loess-like material over mixed, silty and clayey alluviums or residuum weathered from basalt. The climate is humid temperate with cool moist winters and warm dry summers. The average July temperature is 67 degrees F., average January temperature is 39 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 50 degrees to 54 degrees F. Average annual precipitation is 50 to 70 inches. Frost-free season is 165 to 210 days."

Cascade soils are somewhat poorly drained and have chroma of 3 or more in the B horizon. Cornelius, Goble and Kinton soils are moderately well drained. Helvetia soils lack fragipans and are moderately well drained."
