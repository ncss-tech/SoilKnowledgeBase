  "OVERVIEW": "The Delena series consists of moderately deep to a fragipan, poorly drained soils that formed in loess-like material over old, mixed, silty alluvial or residuum weathered from basalt. Delena soils are on uplands and have slopes of 3 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are saturated with water during the winter and spring unless artificially drained. Soil depth is more than 5 feet but rooting depth is restricted by seasonal water table of less than 30 inches. Depth to fragipan is 20 to 30 inches. Mean annual soil temperature is 51 degrees to 55 degrees F.  Umbric epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It has granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 moist and 1 or 2 dry.  Redox concentrations are distinct or prominent. The texture is commonly silty clay loam but includes silt loam in the upper part in some pedons.\nThe 2Btx horizon (fragipan) has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. The coatings on peds and tongues have the lower chroma and yellower hue. This horizon is firm or very firm and commonly brittle clay films are common to many and faint to distinct in pores and on cleavage planes or polygonal cracks."
