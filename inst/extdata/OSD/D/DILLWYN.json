  "OVERVIEW": "The Dillwyn series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian sand. These soils are on dunes and interdunes on paleo-terraces in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 24 inches (61 centimeters), and mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F (13 degrees C).",

Aline, Goltry, Pratt, Tivin and Tivoli soils are on higher positions which have undulating to dune like topography. Aline and Goltry soils have argillic horizons. Pratt, Tivin and Tivoli soils do not have redoximorphic concentrations within depths of 40 inches (102 centimeters). The fine-loamy Solvay soils are on similar or slightly lower positions as Dillwyn soils. The Plevna and Plev soils are in depressional areas below the Dillwyn soils. The Dillhut soils are on similar positions as Dillwyn soils but have a loamy paleosol between 20 to 40 inches (50 to 102 centimeters)."
