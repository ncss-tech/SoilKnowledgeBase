Aline, Goltry, Pratt, Tivin and Tivoli soils are on higher positions which have undulating to dune like topography. Aline and Goltry soils have argillic horizons. Pratt, Tivin and Tivoli soils do not have redoximorphic concentrations within depths of 40 inches (102 centimeters). The fine-loamy Solvay soils are on similar or slightly lower positions as Dillwyn soils. The Plevna and Plev soils are in depressional areas below the Dillwyn soils. The Dillhut soils are on similar positions as Dillwyn soils but have a loamy paleosol between 20 to 40 inches (50 to 102 centimeters)."
