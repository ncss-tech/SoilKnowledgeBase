Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 1,400 to 1,620 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."

Soils previously correlated as wet phases of Dressler are now within the range of the tentative Dresslewet series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 51 cm (Ap and A horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 100 and 150 cm at certain times during normal years (C1, C2, and C3 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bw horizon and parts of the A and C1 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: User Pedon ID: 2006NV005017.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
