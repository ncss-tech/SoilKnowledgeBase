  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 degrees to 53 degrees F. The soils usually are dry and are dry at depths between 4 to 12 inches for about 100 to 120 consecutive days in the four-month period following the summer solstice. Depth to soft bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 20 inches thick. Rock fragments in the Bt horizon range from 5 to 30 percent hard lava pebbles and 10 to 30 percent soft weathered tuffaceous diatomaceous pebbles. The solum is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry.\nThe B2t horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is clay loam or sandy clay loam and averages 25 to 35 percent clay and 35 to 50 percent fine sand and coarser."

Bissell, Cowiche, Galeppi, Harriman, Margerum, Orr and Springmeyer soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock. Also, Harriman soils have mollic epipedons 20 to 35 inches thick and Orr soils have 18 to 25 percent clay in the Bt horizon. Bjork, Indiano and Simcoe soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Frederickson soils have Bt horizons that average more than 50 percent fine sand or coarser and are underlain by pumiceous tuff."

These soils formed in alluvium weathered from tuff, basalt, and diatomite. The climate is semiarid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches. Mean January temperature is 27 degrees to 29 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 65 degrees to 69 degrees F. The average annual temperature is 46 degrees to 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

Lorella soils have gravelly and very gravelly heavy clay loam and clay Bt horizons and have bedrock at depths of 10 to 20 inches. Modoc soils have duripans at depths of 20 to 40 inches."
