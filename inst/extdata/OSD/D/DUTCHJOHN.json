  "OVERVIEW": "The Dutchjohn series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and volcanic ash over colluvium and residuum derived from tuff. The Dutchjohn soils are on plateaus and rock pediments. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
