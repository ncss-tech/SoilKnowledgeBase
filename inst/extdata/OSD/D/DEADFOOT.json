  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Deadfoot series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on hills and mountains with slopes of 30 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in material weathered from granitic rock.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches (250 to 300 mm).  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F. (7 to 10 degrees C.).",
