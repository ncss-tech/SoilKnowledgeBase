  "OVERVIEW": "The Divers series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed ash, colluvium, and glacial till weathered from andesite and basalt. Divers soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 3 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 95 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
