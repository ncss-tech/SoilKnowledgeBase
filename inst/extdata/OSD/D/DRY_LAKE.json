  "OVERVIEW": "The Dry Lake series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in lacustrine sediments from mixed sources including granodiorite, quartzite, basalt, and limestone. Dry Lake soils are on undulating lower fans, valley plains and playa margins and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 58 degrees F.",
