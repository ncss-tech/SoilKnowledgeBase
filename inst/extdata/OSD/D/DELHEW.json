Aspetill soils have 18 to 25 percent clay and are dominated by cobbles in the particle-size control section.  Badwater soils have 25 to 35 percent clay and are dominated by boulders in the particle-size control section.  Bickmore, Blackbear, Bluebell, Buena Vista, Hawkinspeak, Littlemud, Rutherford, and Woodhurst soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Booneville soils have mean annual soil temperature of 2 to 4 degrees C.  Dab soils are dominated by medium and coarse gravel of volcanic lithology in the particle-size control section.  Dailybasin and Igor soils have an ustic moisture regime.  Keman soils have mean annual soil temperature of 4 to 6 degrees C.  Lostcannon soils have the base of the argillic horizon below 100 cmfrom the soil surface.  Monibasin soils have 18 to 25 percent clay, are dominated by stones in the particle-size control section, and have rock fragments that are volcanic rocks.  Parkalley soils are dominated by flagstones and average 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Parkay soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Redbird soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates within 100 cm of the soil surface.  Sweetmount soils are deep to paralithic contacts and have subhorizons of the argillic horizon with 27 to 50 percent clay."

Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 2,378 to 3,048 meters.  The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 760 mm, mean annual temperature is 2 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 70 days."
