Ben Lomond soils are deep over a weathered sandstone paralithic contact and have mean annual soil temperature of about 56 degrees F. Junipero soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact, do not have B horizons and have mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 58 degrees F. Olaton soils are deep over a paralithic contact and do not have an O horizon.  The Pigtoe series is not currently in the OSD database and cannot be adequately competed."
