  "OVERVIEW": "The Diaspar series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in fan alluvium from granitic and volcanic rock.  Diaspar soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.",
