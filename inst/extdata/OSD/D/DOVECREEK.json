Slope gradients are 2 percent or less.  They formed in silty alluvial sediments. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 35 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 17 inches."

Ludden and Ranslo soils are on slightly lower landscape positions and have a fine textured particle size control section.  In addition, Ranslo soils have a natric horizon.  The Straw soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section and are on similar landscape positions."
