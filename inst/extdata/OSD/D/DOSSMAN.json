  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 50 to 100 inches.  Typically less than 3 percent total sand occurs throughout the solum, but sand ranges to 10 percent.  Where the loess mantle is thin the sand content in some pedons will exceed 10 percent below depths of 48 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam.  It is strongly acid or medium acid.  The AB horizon has similar characteristics except that chroma ranges from 4 through 6.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 or 6.  They are silty clay loam or silt loam with weighted average clay content of 30 to 35 percent.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid through extremely acid.\nThe C horizon is brownish silt loam.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Armcar, Barnsdall, Dexter and Hicks series in the same family and the Atwood, Evangeline, Gallion, Lexington, Memphis, Rexor, Rilla, Silerton and Vian series.  The Armcar and Dexter soils have more than 10 percent sand in the control section.  The Barnsdall soils are underlain by loamy 2C horizons.  The Hicks soils are underlain by phosphatic limestone and shales.  The Atwood, Evangeline, Memphis, Silerton and Vian do not have a 20 percent clay decrease within a depth of 60 inches.  Gallion, Memphis and Rilla soils have a base saturation of more than 60 percent.  Lexington soils have sandy loam or loam 2B horizons.  Rexor soils have B horizons with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.  Silerton soils have less than 35 percent base saturation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dossman soils are on convex slopes in dissected hill areas.  Slope gradients are 1 to 30 percent.  Typically the soil formed in 15 to 30 feet of oxidized and leached pre-Peoria age loess.  The climate is warm and humid.  The average air temperature is about 68 degrees F., and the average rainfall is about 58 inches near the type location.  Thornthwaite P-E index is near 70."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Calhoun, Duralde, Evangeline, McKamie, and Muskogee soils.  The moderately well drained and bisequal Evangeline soils occur on gentle slopes at higher elevations.  The gray and poorly drained Calhoun soils occur at higher elevations on tabular divides in association with brownish Duralde soils on pimple mounds.  Muskogee and McKamie soils have clay layers in the subsoil and are at lower elevations where the loess mantle is very thin or absent."
