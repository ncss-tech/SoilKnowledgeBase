The soils are usually moist but, in most years, they are dry between 4 and 12 inches for 80 to 110 consecutive days during the summer.  The soils crack to 20 inches or more in the summer months in more than 7 out of 10 years.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  It has 0 to 5 percent gravel.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 moist, 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is a silty clay or clay with 45 to 60 percent clay.  Soft gravel fragments range from 0 to 15 percent."
