  "OVERVIEW": "The Darow series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from siltstone or shale.  Darow soils are on hillslopes and have slopes of 1 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches (610 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F (12 degrees C).",

The soils are usually moist but, in most years, they are dry between 4 and 12 inches (10 to 30 cm) for 80 to 110 consecutive days during the summer.  The soils crack to 20 inches (50 cm) or more in the summer months in more than 7 out of 10 years.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches (50 to 100 cm).  It has 0 to 5 percent gravel.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 moist, 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is a silty clay or clay with 45 to 60 percent clay.  Soft gravel fragments range from 0 to 15 percent."

Adaboi, Forsgren, and Hann soils do not have bedrock within 60 inches (150 cm).  Ayette soils have a paralithic contact between 100 and 150 cm and slickensides in the argillic horizon.  Gimmi soils are well drained and average 15 to 35 percent gravel and cobbles in the argillic horizon. Karney soils are well drained, have a mean annual soil temperature of 49 to 53 degrees F (9 to 12 degrees C), and have a lithic contact below the paralithic contact.  Kuck soils have a mean annual precipitation of 12 to 20 inches (305 to 510 mm), 5 to 30 percent rock fragments, and value of 2 or 3 dry in the A horizon and 4 or 5 dry in the Bt, chroma of 1 to 3 dry in the A horizon and 1 or 2 dry in the Bt.  Leepcreek soils have a lithic contact between 100 and 150 cm. McDesh soils have a lithic contact between 50 and 100 cm.  Montour soils have calcareous C horizons and do not have bedrock within 60 inches (150 cm).  Tub soils contain secondary carbonates, do not have bedrock within 150 cm, and have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 50 degrees F (8 to 10 degrees C).  Ukiah soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 51 degrees F (8 to 11 degrees C)."
