  "OVERVIEW": "The Darow series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from siltstone or shale.  Darow soils are on hillslopes and have slopes of 1 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist but, in most years, they are dry between 4 and 12 inches for 80 to 110 consecutive days during the summer.  The soils crack to 20 inches or more in the summer months in more than 7 out of 10 years.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  It has 0 to 5 percent gravel.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 moist, 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is a silty clay or clay with 45 to 60 percent clay.  Soft gravel fragments range from 0 to 15 percent."
