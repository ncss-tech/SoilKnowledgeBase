  "OVERVIEW": "The Dogpaws series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from basalt. Dogpaws soils are on weathered lava plains and alluvial fans have slopes of 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
