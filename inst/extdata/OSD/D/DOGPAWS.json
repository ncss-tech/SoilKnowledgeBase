  "OVERVIEW": "The Dogpaws series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from basalt. Dogpaws soils are on weathered lava plains and alluvial fans have slopes of 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

The average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches and occurs as thunderstorms in July, August and September and as rain and snow in the winter. The frost-free period ranges from 130 to 160 days."
