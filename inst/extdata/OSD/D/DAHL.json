The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to sedimentary bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to the 3 Bkss horizon is 40 to 55 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is 40 to 60 percent clay.\nThe Bss horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  It has common to many intersecting slickensides.  The upper Bss1 and Bss2 horizons are clay or silty clay with 40 to 60 percent clay.  The lower Bss3 horizon is silty clay loam with 30 to 40 percent clay.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or loam with 20 to 27 percent clay.\nThe 3Bkss horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
