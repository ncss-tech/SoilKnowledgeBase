  "OVERVIEW": "The Dahl series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on basins.  They formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rock.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

It is 40 to 60 percent clay.\nThe Bss horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  It has common to many intersecting slickensides.  The upper Bss1 and Bss2 horizons are clay or silty clay with 40 to 60 percent clay.  The lower Bss3 horizon is silty clay loam with 30 to 40 percent clay.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.
