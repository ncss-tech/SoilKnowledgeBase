  "OVERVIEW": "The Donnelsville series consists of deep or very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from limestone or dolomite. These soils are on till plains. Slope ranges from 18 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
