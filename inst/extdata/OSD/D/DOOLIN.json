  "OVERVIEW": "The Doolin series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils.  The Doolin soils upper part formed in old alluvium and the lower part formed in sandstone of Permian age. These soils are on slightly concave to linear summits of paleoterraces on high stream divides in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 in).",
