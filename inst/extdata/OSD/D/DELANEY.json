  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Delaney soils are 40 to 80 inches deep to hard bedrock or a strongly contrasting layer of alluvium.\nThe mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 57 degrees F.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from February 10 to December 25 and exceeds 47 degrees F from March 25 to December 1.  The soil is dry between the depths of 12 and 36 inches from mid-July to mid-October and are moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.\nThe soil is medium acid to neutral.  It is assumed that the base saturation is greater than 60 percent in some part of the upper 10 to 30 inches.  Sixty to 80 percent of the sands are coated with some volcanic glass.  Below the A horizon, the soil is 80 to 95 percent sand and 5 to 15 percent silt.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown, brown, light brownish gray, pale brown, very pale brown or light gray (10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 7/2, 7/3; 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2, 7/2).  Moist color ranges from very dark grayish brown and brown to dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/3; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2).  Organic carbon ranges from 0.3 to 0.6 percent.  It is sand, loamy sand, or sandy loam.  Rock fragments make up about 5 to 35 percent and consist of 1 to 10 percent cobbles and stones and 5 to 30 percent gravel.  Fragments are mostly rounded pumice but include hard volcanic rock.\nThe C horizon is light brownish gray, pale yellow or white (10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3, 7/4, 8/2, 8/3; 2.5Y 6/2, 6/4, 7/, 7/4, 8/2, 8/4).  Moist color is very dark grayish brown or brown (10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2, 4/4, 5/2).  It is sandy or loamy sand.  Rock fragments make up 5 to 35 percent and consist of 0 to 25 percent stones and cobbles and 5 to 30 percent gravel.  In some pedons rock fragments make up to 60 percent at depths below 40 inches.  Sands grains are multicolored making color difficult to determine."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Plutos series in the same family and the Avis, Deetz, Oosen, Quincy, and Shasta series in other families.  Avis soils have an ashy skeletal control section, a frigid soil temperature regime and base saturation of less than 60 percent.  Deetz soils have base saturation of less than 60 percent at depths of 10 to 30 inches and have 70 to 85 sand and 15 to 30 percent silt.  Oosen soils have base saturation of less than 60 percent and have frigid soil temperatures.  Plutos soils are 30 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact of basalt bedrock.  Quincy soils have a torric moisture regime and mixed mineralogy.  Shasta soils have an umbric epipedon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Delaney soils are on glacial outwash plains and fans.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial materials from volcanic rock and volcanic ash.  Elevations are 2,800 to 4,500 feet.  Stones are common in some areas and are 5 to 100 feet apart.  Up to 0.1 percent of the area may be covered with stones.  The climate is continental and subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 16 inches.  Snowfall is 18 to 24 inches.  Mean January temperature is 30 to 34 degrees F; mean July temperature is 65 to 69 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 46 to 51 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 100 to 140 days."
