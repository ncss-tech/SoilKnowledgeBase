  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 28 to 50 inches. The alluvial mantle ranges from 20 to 40 inches thick and has less than 30 percent fine or very fine sand and 30 percent or more of medium, coarse, and very coarse sand.  The particle-size control section averages between 18 and 30 percent clay and from 15 to 50 percent fine sand and coarser.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the alluvial mantle and from 2 to 35 percent in the till.  Volume of cobbles and stones ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout.  Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the alluvial mantle but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the till subsoil and from slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the till substratum.  Redox accumulations are throughout the soil below the A horizon.  Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less occur within 20 inches and are 50 percent or more of the matrix in at least the upper 5 inches of the argillic horizon. Saturation occurs above 1 foot for long periods.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy sand or sandy loam.\nDancy soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E horizon above.  The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is sandy loam or loam.\nSome pedons have a 2B/Eg horizon.  The 2Eg part has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is typically sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam or the gravelly analogs but in some pedons it is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.  The 2Btg part has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam or the gravelly analogs.\nThe 2Btg horizon has color and texture like the 2Btg part described above except some pedons have subhorizons of sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a 2Bt horizon below the 2B/Eg or 2Btg horizon, with hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe 2Cg or 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 2 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 8.  It has texture like the 2Bt horizon above."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dancy soils are in upland drainageways and depressions on ground moraines underlain by bedrock.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in a mantle of loamy and sandy alluvium and in the underlying loamy glacial till or loamy residuum weathered from igneous and metamorphic bedrock, or both.  The till is believed to be derived mainly from the local residuum, but the glacial stratigraphy in the area where these soils occur is not fully worked out.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 120 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 780 to 1950 feet."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Surface runoff is slow or ponded.  Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the alluvial mantle and moderate in the till.  Dancy soils have an apparent seasonal high water table from 1 foot above to 1 foot below the surface for long periods from September to June in most years."
