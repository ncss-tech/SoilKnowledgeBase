  "OVERVIEW": "The Drury series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in silty local alluvial sediments or in silty outwash. These soils are on foot slopes of river bluffs adjacent to flood plains and on stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F (13 degrees C), and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches (1016 mm).",

It is moderately acid to neutral except pedons that have been limed range to moderately alkaline in the Ap horizon. The control section averages between 18 to 25 percent clay.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 (4 to 6 dry), and chroma of 2 through 4. Pedons that have color value of 3 (5 dry) have an A or Ap horizon less than 9 inches (23 cm) in thickness. The Ap or A horizon is silt loam or silt.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silt loam or silt.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6 in the upper part and 2 to 6 in the lower part. It is silt loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Some pedons show evidence of stratification, most commonly below a depth of 45 inches (114 cm). Strata are loam, silt loam, and very fine sandy loam. The C horizon typically is slightly acid or neutral, but ranges to slightly alkaline. Some pedons contain free carbonates below a depth of 40 inches (102 cm). Some pedons contain buried horizons that commonly are below a depth of 50 inches (127 cm)."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Contrary, Exette and Killduff series in the same family and the Moshannon, Raddle, Seaton, and Timula series in related families. Contrary soils contain low chroma relict mottles throughout the Bw horizon. Exette soils contain relict mottles in the upper part of the solum and typically have yellowish hue and lower chroma in the solum. Killduff soils contain more clay in the control section. Moshannon soils have an irregular decrease in organic matter content with increasing depth. Raddle soils have a mollic epipedon. Seaton soils have an argillic horizon. Timula soils contain free carbonates within a depth of 40 inches (102 cm)."

Slopes commonly are 2 to 10 percent but range between 0 and 30 percent. Drury soils formed in silty local alluvial sediments, and less commonly in silty outwash. Mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 57 degrees F (8 to 14 degrees C), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 48 inches (864 to 1219 mm). Frost free days range from 170 to 200 days.

Raddle soils are on similar parts of the landscape nearby and Seaton soils are on uplands upslope from Drury soils. The Alford and Fayette soils have an argillic horizon and are on the side slopes and summits of the bluffs above Drury soils. Haymond and Wakeland soils contain less clay and are on flood plains below Drury soils. Worthen soils are on nearby similar landscapes and have a mollic epipedon."
