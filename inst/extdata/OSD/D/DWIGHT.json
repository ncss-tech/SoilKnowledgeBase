Lab data supports a natric horizon. Updated the intro paragraph. Converted English measurements to metric. Changed format to semi-tabular. In the Range of Characteristics, added soil moisture, soil temperature, particle size control section clay and sand percent. Added clay content, sand content, electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio, Exchangeable Sodium Percentage, rock fragments, calcium carbonate equivalent, and reaction to horizon data. Increased the reaction to strongly alkaline in the subsurface horizons based on lab data. Updated the competing series section. Updated the geographic settings section. Updated parent material to residuum from weathered limestone and shale to fit with surrounding soils. Added precipitation pattern. Updated geographically associated soils section. Change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity. Added remarks section. Updated additional data section.\n06/2020 BKN Updated RIC to meet current standards. Added argillic horizon and lithic contact to remarks. Updated Keys to Soil Taxonomy to Twelfth Edition.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nData for typical pedon is from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska samples 40A1782 (59KS015007)\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
