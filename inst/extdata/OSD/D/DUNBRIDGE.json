  "OVERVIEW": "The Dunbridge series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in sandy and loamy drift overlying limestone or dolostone bedrock. These soils are on reefs on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
