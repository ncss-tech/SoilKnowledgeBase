  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The control section is a silt loam or silty clay loam and is commonly 25 to 35 percent clay, and less than 15 percent very fine sand or coarser.  The soil is saturated from spring to summer.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature ranges from 53 to 59 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick.\nThe A horizon value of 1 or 2 and chroma of 0 to 1 wet.  Structure is moderate or strong very fine or fine subangular blocky and moderate or weak medium or coarse prismatic.  It has 5 to 20 percent organic matter.  It has 5 to 15 percent glass.  It has acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.3 to 0.7.\nThe C horizon has hue that ranges from 2.5Y to 10YR.  When hue is close to 2.5Y, value is 2 or 3, chroma is 2 or less, and distinct mottles occur in the lower part of the mollic epipedon.  The mottles may be lacking if chroma is 1 or less and hue is 10YR of redder.  The structure is weak coarse prismatic or massive.  Some pedons have sand and gravel below 40 inches."
