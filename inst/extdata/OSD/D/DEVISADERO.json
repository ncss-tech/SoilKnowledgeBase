  "OVERVIEW": "The Devisadero series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone or shale. Devisadero soils are on sides of mountains and have slopes of 40 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
