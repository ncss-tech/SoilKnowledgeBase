  "OVERVIEW": "The DePere series consists of well drained and moderately well drained, fine-textured soils that formed in alluvium washed mainly from red clay in glacial drift areas. These soils are on flood plains of principal streams. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Horizonation is moderate to weak.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2, and chroma of 1. Texture is silty clay loam. Reaction is mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is typically silty clay although there can be a wide range of textures below a depth of 30 inches. Some pedons have layers of sand, gravel, or cobblestones. These coarse layers contain numerous shells of snails and small clams. Other pedons are silty clay loam to depths of 48 to 60 inches. Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of DePere soils are used for pasture. Bluegrass is the common pasture forage plant. In a few areas, where drainage has been improved or protected from flooding, the soils are cropped for corn or oats. Native vegetation is shrubs and trees, such as elm and thornapple."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: There is limited historical documentation available for DePere Series other than what is published in the Soil Survey of Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin (1973). Soil names for this survey were approved in 1967. The 1967 Taxonomic Class was Fine, mixed, nonacid, mesic Typic Udifluvents.\nThe DePere Series is presently correlated in Fond du Lac County. There is no record of when this series was made inactive.  With this 03/2025 revision, DePere series is now reactivated until field investigations are conducted to evaluate the range in properties, in particular the depth to the seasonal high water table, and the extent.\nThe Wisconsin NRCS State Office requested that null or missing OSD information be populated in the OSD Database so it can be accessed for reference. These references are critical for NRI sampling verification, program eligibility for onsite, and compliance review and checks. There was no OSD available in the OSD Database for DePere Series.\nThis OSD is based on data available in the Soil Survey of Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin (1973) and in NASIS data mapunits (Rec IDs 269645 and 269673)."
