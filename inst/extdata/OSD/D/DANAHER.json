  "OVERVIEW": "The Danaher series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from volcanic and sedimentary rock.  These soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
