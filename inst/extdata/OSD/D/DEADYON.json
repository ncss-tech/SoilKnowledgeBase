  "OVERVIEW": "The Deadyon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks.  The Deadyon soils are on fan skirts, inset fans and fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
