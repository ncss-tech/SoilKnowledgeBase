  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 18 to 28 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Distinct to prominent redox features are below 7 inches from the mineral surface but within 30 inches.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent by volume throughout the soil, with the gravel size predominating.  Surface stoniness ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum and from strongly acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe A, or Ap horizon where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  The Ap horizon is 4 to 9 inches thick.  It has weak to moderate, fine to medium granular structure.  It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogs.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe E horizon, where present, is neutral or has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 0 or 1.  It has weak fine granular or weak thin platy structure.  It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogs.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe upper part of the Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 8.  It has weak or moderate, fine or medium granular or subangular blocky structure.  The lower part of the Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y with value and chroma of 3 to 6.  It has weak or moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky, weak thin to thick platy or weak fine or medium granular structure.  The B horizons are silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogs.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It has weak or moderate, thin to thick platy or moderate or strong, coarse or very coarse prismatic structure.  Consistence ranges from friable to firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam, loam or their gravelly analogs.  It ranges from moderate or strong very coarse prismatic, parting to weak to strong, medium or thick platy, or fine or medium subangular blocky structure, or the C horizon is massive.  Consistence is friable or firm.  It has few to many films on faces of peds."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Chesuncook, Colonel, Crary, Dixfield, Mundal, Peru, Skerry, Sunapee, Telos, and Worden series are in the same family.  All these soils have dense basal till substratums except Sunapee.  Sunapee soils have coarser textures with less than 50 percent silt in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dixmont soils are on till plains and ridges.  Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent, but is dominantly between 3 and 15 percent.  The soils formed in glacial till derived mainly from slate, shale, and phyllite with small amounts of granite, fine grained quartzite, and sandstone.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 41 to 46 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 46 inches.  The frost-free season ranges from 100 to 150 days.  Elevation ranges from 10 to 1000 feet above mean sea level."

Burnham soils are very poorly drained, and are in the lowest positions on the landscape.  Monarda soils are poorly drained, and are in lower positions on the landscape. Thorndike soils are somewhat excessively drained, have bedrock within 20 inches of the surface, and are in higher positions on the landscape."
