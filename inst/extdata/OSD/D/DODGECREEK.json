  "OVERVIEW": "The Dodgecreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils on outwash terraces.  They formed in sandy glacial outwash with a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderate and moderately rapid in the upper part and rapid and very rapid below.  Slope ranges from 2 to 12 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",
