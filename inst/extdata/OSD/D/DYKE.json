  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to more than 60 inches.  The depth to hard rock is more than 6 feet. Stone lines commonly coincide with the solum thickness, but can be at greater depths or absent.  In the solum the gravel content is 0 to 30 percent and cobblestone and stone content is 0 to 35 percent but total rock fragment content is less than 35 percent.  In the C horizon gravel content ranges from 15 to 30 percent and cobblestones and stones range from 20 to 60 percent.  The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the solum unless limed, and very strongly acid to moderately acid in the C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is silt loam or loam and cobbly or very cobbly analogues where not eroded.\nSome pedons have a BE horizon.  It has the same color range as the A horizon and is loam or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Dry value is less than 5.  The Bt horizon is commonly clay but includes clay loam, silty clay loam and silty clay.\nThe C horizon is cobbly and variegated in color."

Cazadero soils receive 60 to 80 inches of precipitation annually but average less than 1 inch per month during July and August.  Rapidan soils formed in residuum and do not contain rounded fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes commonly are 6 to 20 percent but range from 0 to 35 percent.  The soils developed in colluvial material from soils and rocks high in ferromagnesium minerals. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 50 to 59 degrees F; mean annual precipitation is 37 to 44 inches; and the frost-free precipitation is 37 to 44 inches; and the frost-free days range days range from 183 to 192."
