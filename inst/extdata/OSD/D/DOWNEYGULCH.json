  "OVERVIEW": "The Downeygulch series consists of moderately deep well drained soils on stable summits and foot slopes of plateaus. Downeygulch soils formed in mixed ash, loess, and colluvium derived from basalt. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
