  "OVERVIEW": "The Daklos series consists of very shallow to shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and slope alluvium derived from Cretaceous-aged sandstone. Daklos soils are on structural benches, hillslopes on structural benches, and ledges on escarpments. Slopes range from 2 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

Andanada soils have secondary calcium carbonate throughout the soil profile, derived from basalt bedrock, and are less than 10 inches to hard basalt bedrock. Cheeta soils have mean annual soil temperature lower than 52 degrees F. and are in MLRA 34B-Warm Central Desrtic Basins and Plateaus. Ednagrey soils are moist in the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative between July and September. Hillburn soils are inactive. Meriwhitica soils have a mean annual soil temperature more than 54 degrees F. Nonip soils have loamy silt loam, clay loam textures and are derived from shell and siltstone. Reef soils have hues at 5YR and 7.5YR.  Redsun soils are derived from limestone and 7.5YR to 2.5YR hues. Skos soils have 2.5YR or 5YR hues and contain 20 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section. Teesto soils are formed from basalt and other pyroclastic materials and contain less than 5 percent CaC03 in the particle size control section. Redsun, Sunup, and Windcomb soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June."
