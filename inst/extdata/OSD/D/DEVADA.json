  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Devada soils are on plateaus, mountains, and hills.  They typically occur on summit, shoulder, and footslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum derived from volcanic rock with additions of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,340 to 2,290 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 60 to 110 days."
