  "OVERVIEW": "The Devada series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from volcanic rocks with additions of loess and volcanic ash.  Devada soils are on plateaus, mountains, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
