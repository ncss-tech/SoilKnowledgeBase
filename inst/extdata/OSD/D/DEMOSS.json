  "OVERVIEW": "The Demoss series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in old semi-consolidated sediments.  Demoss soils are on terraces and basins.  Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent.  Average annual temperature is 50 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is 18 inches.",
