  "STATES": "AL,TN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Dellrose series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in medium textured, cherty colluvium on foot slopes and steep hillsides. These soils have moderately rapid permeability. Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  Near the type location, mean annual temperature is 58.5 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 52.9 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Chert fragments range from 10 to 35 percent in each horizon above the discontinuity except the lower part of the Bt horizon ranges to 50 percent.  Fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the clayey part below the discontinuity.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid except the surface layer is less acid in recently limed areas.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4. The fine earth fraction is silt loam or loam.\nMost pedons have a transitional horizon between the A and Bt horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons also have subhorizons within the Bt horizon that have hue of 5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4 to 8. The fine earth fraction is silty clay loam or silt loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown, yellow or gray.  It is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam."
