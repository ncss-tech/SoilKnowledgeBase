  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Chert fragments range from 10 to 35 percent in each horizon above the discontinuity except the lower part of the Bt horizon ranges to 50 percent.  Fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the clayey part below the discontinuity.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid except the surface layer is less acid in recently limed areas.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4. The fine earth fraction is silt loam or loam.\nMost pedons have a transitional horizon between the A and Bt horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons also have subhorizons within the Bt horizon that have hue of 5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4 to 8. The fine earth fraction is silty clay loam or silt loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown, yellow or gray.  It is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam."

Armour soils are fine-silty and have base saturation of more than 35 percent.  Harpeth soils are fine-silty.  Humphreys and Sequatchie soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Porters, Statler, and Tusquitee soils are mesic."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dellrose soils are on foot slopes and hillsides.  Slopes are dominantly 12 to 40 percent, but range from 2 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in medium textured, cherty colluvium about 4 1/2 to 6 feet thick and the underlying clayey residuum.  Near the type location, mean annual temperature is 58.5 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 52.9 inches."

Bodine and Hawthorne soils have a pale colored A horizon and more than 35 percent chert fragments in the B horizon.  Mimosa soils are clayey and have a higher base saturation."
