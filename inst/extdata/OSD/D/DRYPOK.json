  "OVERVIEW": "The Drypok series consists of moderately deep, well excessively drained soils formed in ash over residuum from tuffs. These soils occur on ridges and mountain sideslopes.  Slopes are 5 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
