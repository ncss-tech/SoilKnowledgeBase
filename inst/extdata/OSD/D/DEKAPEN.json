  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dekapen soils are on glacially modified mountain plateaus and backslopes at elevations of 1,600 to 2,200 feet.  Slopes are 8 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in volcanic ash, loess, and glacial till derived from sandstone.  Dekapen soils are in a cool marine climate with cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  Snow cover lasts from January through March.  Average annual precipitation is 65 to 75 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 32 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 59 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 140 days."
