    "content": "REMARKS:\nThe Dorcheat series was established to replace the Acadia soil series in MLRA 133B-Western Coastal Plains. The Acadia series was originally set up in MLRA 150A-Gulf Coast Prairies and correlated in MLRA's 150A, 152B-Western Gulf Coast Flatwoods and 133B-Western Coastal Plains. With such variations in the climatic environment, it was decided that a new series was needed to accommodate those soils in MLRA 133B.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 27 cm (0 to 11 in) (A,BE horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 27 to 168 cm (11 to 66 in) (Btg, Btg/E, 2Bthorizons)\nRedox concentrations: 8 to 203 cm (3 to 80 in) (BE, Btg/E, 2Bt, 3BC horizons)\nRedox depletions: 8 to 203cm (3 to 203 in) (BE, Btg/E, 2Bt, 3BC horizons)\nAquic conditions:   0 to 44 cm (0 to 17 in) (A, BE, Btg/E1)\nEpisaturation: 0 to 44 cm (0 to 17 in) (A, BE, Btg/E)\nReduced Matrix: 27 to 80 cm (11 to 31 in) (BE, Btg/E horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL sample S2017AR073001\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 12th Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
