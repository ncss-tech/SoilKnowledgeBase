  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 36 to 60 inches in thickness.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches in thickness.  It does not include the upper part of the 2Bt horizon in some pedons.\nThe A horizon, including the Ap horizon, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is medium acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay and averages between 38 and 60 percent clay.  It is strongly acid or medium acid.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 or 5; chroma of 2 through 4, and is mottled.  Mottles have hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y; value of 3 through 6; and chroma of 2 through 8.   The 3Bt horizon is dominantly clay loam, sandy clay loam, or loam, and contains strata of sandy loam, silty clay loam, or silt loam in some pedons.  Sandy loam, loam, or silt loam strata are less than 6 inches in thickness above a depth of 40 inches.  The 3Bt horizon is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  It typically is loamy sand or sand at depths below 40 inches and is stratified in many pedons.  Strata include clay loam, loam, silty clay loam, silt loam, or sandy loam.  The 3C horizon is slightly acid or neutral."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Shullsburg and Swygert series in the same family, and the Elliott, Flanagan, Herrick, Ipava, Keller, Martin, Martinton, and Rutland series.  All these soils lack hue redder than 7.5YR.  In addition, Shullsburg soils have shale bedrock at depths between 20 and 40 inches; Swygert, Elliott, Martin, and Rutland soils contain more clay and less sand in the lower part of the solum, and Martin soils have a mollic epipedon greater than 24 inches in thickness; Flanagan, Herrick, Ipava, and Keller soils are dominated by montmorillonitic clay, and typically contain less clay, in the control section; and Martinton soils are dominated by illitic clay, and typically contain less clay, in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Denrock soils are on nearly level, slightly convex terraces.  Slope gradients are 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in loess or other silty material, clayey lacustrine sediments, and stratified alluvium.  The mean annual temperature varies from 48 degrees to 53 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation varies from 32 to 34 inches."

The well drained Coyne and Joslin soils contain less clay in the control section and are on slightly higher elevations or more crested convex ridges nearby.  The poorly drained Niota and Zwingle soils lack mollic epipedons, have albic horizons, and are on slightly lower elevations nearby."

    "content": "REMARKS:  The morphology is similar to that of Typic Argiudolls, but these soils behave more like Aquic Argiudolls and are so classified.  Denrock soils perch water at depths of 1 to 2 feet during the spring and are considered to have horizons at depths less than 24 inches that are saturated with water for brief periods during the growing season.\nOSED scanned by SSQA.
