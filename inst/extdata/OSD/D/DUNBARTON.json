  "OVERVIEW": "The Dunbarton series consists of well drained soils shallow to dolomite or other limestone.  These upland soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and the underlying clayey pedisediment or residuum weathered from the underlying bedrock.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 12 to 20 inches, which is the same as the depth to bedrock.  The loess mantle generally is 8 to 10 inches thick but ranges from none, where the soil is eroded, to a maximum of about 15 inches.  The solum typically is neutral but ranges from medium acid, in the upper part, to mildly alkaline in the lower part. Volume of angular pebbles and channers, mainly chert, dolostone, and limestone, ranges from 0 to 30 percent and volume of flagstones ranges from 0 to 20 percent in the pedisediment and residuum. The upper part of the solum formed in loess generally does not contain pebbles.\nThe Ap horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is typically silt loam, but severely eroded phases are silty clay loam.  Where this soil is undisturbed, it has a silt loam A horizon 2 to 4 inches thick and a silt loam E horizon 2 to 5 inches thick.  The A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3, and chroma 1 or 2.  The E horizon has 10YR hue value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  In most cultivated pedons, the E is mixed with the Ap horizon.\nThe BE horizon, or Bt horizon where present, has 7.5YR or 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR hue; value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It typically is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  The argillic horizon averages between 35 to 75 percent clay.  The average is dependent upon the relative amounts of loess and residuum making up the argillic horizon.\nThe 3Bt horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is sandy loam, clay loam, loam, or the rock fragment analogs.\nIn some places, the bedrock is solid, but in other places, it has joints filled with residuum or has a thin Cr layer over the bedrock.  The joints extend downward for several feet.  Typically the bedrock is dolomite, but some is other kinds of linestone."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the only series in this family.  Other series in closely related families are Dubuque, Edmund, Lamoille, NewGlarus, Nordness, and Sogn.  Dubuque and NewGlarus soils have less clay in the upper part of the Bt horizons, thicker sola, and have bedrock at depths between 20 to 40 inches.  Edmund soils have mollic epipedons.  Lamoille soils have a loamy-skeletal 3B horizon within a depth of 40 inches.  Nordness soils are loamy and have somewhat thinner sola.  Sogn soils have mollic epipedons and do not have argillic horizons."

The soils formed in 8 to 10 inches of loess and the underlying clayey pedisediment and in residuum that contains variable amounts of chert or limestone (dolostone) fragments, or both.  Bedrock is at a depth of less than 20 inches.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 37 inches, and mean annual temperature from 42 to 54 degrees F."
