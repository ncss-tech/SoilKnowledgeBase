  "OVERVIEW": "The Davidson series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in materials weathered from dark colored rocks high in ferromagnesian minerals.  These soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep uplands in the Piedmont.  Slopes are commonly 2 to 15 percent but range up to 25 percent.",

Reaction of all horizons ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid, except those surface soils which have been limed.  Concretions range from few to common in the upper part of most pedons.  Flakes of mica are none to common.  Thin gravel lines are in some pedons below 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or clay.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 2.5 or 3, and chroma of 2 through 8.  There may be none to common mottles in shades of yellow and red in the middle and lower horizons.  The particle-size control section averages 40 to 75 percent clay.  The Bt horizons are clay loam or clay.  The lower Bt horizons below 60 inches are sandy clay loam, clay loam, or clay."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Greenville series of the same family and the Anniston, Coronaca, Cumberland, Decatur, Drayke, Gwinnett, Nacogdoches, Rabun, and Rapidan series of closely related families.  Greenville soils formed in clayey marine sediments high in sand.  Anniston soils have more than 35 percent silt in the control section and commonly contain chert or sandstone gravel and cobble throughout.  Coronaca and Cumberland soils have more than 35 percent base saturation.  Decatur soils formed in old alluvium or residuum weathered from limestone and commonly contain fragments of chert.  Drayke, Rabun, and Rapidan soils occur in mesic temperature regimes and have thinner sola.  Gwinnett soils have sola less than 40 inches thick.  Lloyd soils have more than 20 percent decrease in clay from the maximum within 60 inches below the surface. Nacogdoches soils are dominated by tubular halloysite in the Bt horizon and have regoliths high in glauconite."
