  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mineral solum ranges from 51 to 91 centimeters. Depth to bedrock is more than 153 centimeters. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, and loam in the fine-earth fraction, but some pedons have very fine sandy loam or silt loam in the E horizon. The weighted average of clay in the particle-size control section is less than 10 percent. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the solum and from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum. Rock fragments are predominantly gravel, channers, and cobbles with a few stones, and typically range from 5 to 30 percent throughout the mineral soil; in some pedons rock fragment content is less than 5 percent in A, E and/or Bhs horizons. Stones and boulders cover from 0 to 15 percent of the surface. Redoximorphic features in the BC and CB horizons (where present) are 40 centimeters or deeper from the mineral soil surface.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Some pedons have an Oi and/or Oe horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, with value and chroma of 2 to 4. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, with value and chroma of 2 to 3. The Bh horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value and chroma of 2 to 3. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Consistence is friable or firm. Some pedons have a CB horizon with characteristics similar to the BC horizon.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Arrangement of soil particles into aggregates in the Cd horizon is considered to be geogenic and inherited from the parent material. Consistence is firm or very firm. Loose or friable segregated sand lenses with a horizontal orientation that are layered within a loamy matrix constitute 0 to 20 percent of the fabric of the till."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chesuncook, Crary, Dixmont, Howland, Peru, Ragmuff, Skerry, Sunapee, and Worden series. Chesuncook soils have a weighted average of more than 10 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Crary soils have a thin aeolian or water deposited mantle. Dixmont and Sunapee soils lack dense till. Howland soils soils have more than 50 percent silt in the particle-size control section. Peru soils have been mapped to cover both moderately well and somewhat poorly drained conditions. Ragmuff soils have bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 cm. Skerry soils have between 20 to 80 percent segregated sand lenses in the substratum. Worden soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a Bh horizon greater than 10 centimeters thick.\nThe Colonel, Mundal, and Telos series are in related families. Colonel soils have redoximorphic features between depths of 18 to 40 centimeters from the mineral soil surface. Mundal soils have a spodic horizon greater than 45 centimeters thick or a Bh horizon greater than 10 centimeters thick. Telos soils have a weighted average of more than 10 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dixfield soils are on drumlins and till ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent, but commonly is less than 20 percent. The soils formed in dense till of Wisconsin Age derived mainly from mica schist, granite, phyllite, and gneiss. The climate is humid and cool temperate. The mean annual temperature ranges from 3 to 7 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 86 to 122 centimeters. The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 2 to 762 meters above mean sea level."

The Berkshire, Marlow, Monadnock, and Tunbridge soils are in higher topographic positions on the landscape and are better drained. Colonel soils are somewhat poorly drained and are in lower positions on the landscape. Lyman soils are shallow to bedrock and are on higher knolls on the landscape."

Common tree species include sugar maple, red maple, white ash, eastern white pine, eastern hemlock, paper birch, yellow birch, red spruce, white spruce, and balsam fir. Areas cleared of stones are used mainly for hay and pasture. A few areas are used for cultivated crops."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: 1. Dixfield soils were recorrelated to Peru soils as part of the national Soil Data Join Recorrelation initiative. The distinction between the two series was vague, and both were used to describe similar areas of soil on the landscape. Revisions to the Peru Range in Characteristics incorporated values from the Dixfield Official Series Description. As a result of this revision to Peru, the Dixfield series status was changed to inactive.\n2. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Albic horizon - the zone from 3 to 10 centimeters (E horizon).\nb.  Spodic horizon - the zone from 10 to 51 centimeters (Bhs, Bs1, and Bs2 horizons).\nc.  Cd horizon - very firm, dense till at a depth of 64 centimeters.\nd.  Aquic conditions - redoximorphic features at 51 centimeters below the soil surface.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Source of data used in establishing taxonomic class and range in characteristics is Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station, Technical Bulletin 155, 1994.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
