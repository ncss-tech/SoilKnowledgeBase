  "OVERVIEW": "The Dacont series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium from extrusive igneous rocks.  They are on mountainsides, foothills, and fan terraces.  Slopes are 4 to 70 percent.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches. And the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
