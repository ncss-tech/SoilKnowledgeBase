  "OVERVIEW": "The Desario series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from limestone.  Desario soils are on south-facing backslopes of low hills.  Slopes are 5 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
