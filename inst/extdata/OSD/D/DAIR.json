Arloval, Forbar, Norway, Tryon, and Wanser soils formed in areas that receive less than 762 mm (30 inches) of annual precipitation. Barren and Jamaica soils have anthropotransported materials within the series control section. Carrolls soils contain volcanic glass within the series control section. Conrad and Gothenburg soils do not have a B horizon. Junius soils have a B horizon that is thicker than 20 cm (8 inches). Stafford soils are more acidic than neutral in the lower part of the series control section. Tihonet series have excavated fill material within the series control section. Tyre soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches)."

These soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 813 mm (30 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 9.4 degrees C (45 to 49 degrees F). Frost-free period is 120 to 160 days. Elevation is 183 to 305 meters (600 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."
