  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 20 to 40 inches over limestone bedrock. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 36 inches.  Coarse fragments are angular or rounded chert and limestone pebbles, cobbles, and stones.  Chert pebbles on the soil surface range from 5 to 15 percent.  Chert and limestone cobbles and stones 3 to 24 inches in diameter comprise 2 to 45 percent by volume of any horizon.  Reaction is medium acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR and 10YR chroma of 2 to 4 and value of 2 or 3.  Coarse fragment pebbles comprise 5 to 50 percent by volume.  Texture is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam and their gravelly, very gravelly, or cobbly counterparts.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, chroma of 3 to 5 and value of 3 to 6.   Clay content of the soil fine earth fraction us 40 to 75 percent.  The increase in clay content between the A and Bt horizons is 20 to 50 percent (absolute) within 3 inches.  Coarse fragments comprise 35 to 85 percent by volume.  A BCt or Btk horizon occurs in some pedons.\nThe R layer is stronglly cemented to indurated, gray or white limestone bedrock."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Liv is the only series in the same family.  Similar soils include the Bexar, Hanis, Quihi, Rumple, Scullin, Speck, and Spires series. Liv soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact with tuffaceous or other mafic igneous rocks.  Bexar, Hanis, Scullin, Speck, and Spires soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the Bt horizons.  In addition, Bexar and Spires soils lack mollic epipedons; Hanis soils as well as Quihi soils have mean annual soil temperatures of more than 72 degrees F.; Scullin soils as well as Rumple soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick; Speck soils have sola less than 20 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Dina soils are on nearly level to gently sloping upland plateaus and ridges.  Surfaces are plane or convex and slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent, but are mainly less than 2 percent.  The soil formed in residuum over hard crystalline limestone.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 66 to 69 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 23 to 32 inches.  The Thornthwaite annual P-E indices are 31 to 44. Frost free days range from 210 to 245.  Elevation ranges from 1000 to 2300 feet."
