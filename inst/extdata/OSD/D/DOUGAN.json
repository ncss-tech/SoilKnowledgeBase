  "OVERVIEW": "The Dougan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed and colluvium from andesite and granodiorite, mixed with volcanic ash in the upper part.  Dougan soils are on backslopes and ridges of mountains.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 100 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 degrees to 47 degrees F.   Depth to a lithic contact is 30 to 40 inches.  These soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in the summer in all parts of the moisture control section.  The control section averages 45 to 70 percent rock fragments and 10 to 20 percent saprolitic fragments.  The umbric epipedon ranges from 10 to 12 inches in thickness and is influenced by volcanic ash.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist, 1 to 3 dry.  Gravel content is 30 to 40 percent and cobbles from 5 to 10 percent.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  Gravel content is 30 to 40 percent, cobbles from 5 to 20 percent and paragravel from 5 to 30 percent.  It is very gravelly loam, very gravelly silt loam, very cobbly loam, or very cobbly silt loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 to 5 moist or dry.  Pebbles range from 45 to 55 percent, cobbles from 15 to 30 percent and saprolitic fragments from 5 to 15 percent.  It is extremely gravelly loam or extremely cobbly loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid."

These soils formed in colluvium from andesite and granodiorite with an admixture of volcanic ash in the upper part.  Summers are cool and moist.  Winters are cold and wet with snow cover from December through March.  Mean annual precipitation is 90 to 110 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F.  Mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 90 to 130 days."

The zone between 1 and 12 inches is assumed to have andic soil properties and is based on lab data from similar soils (S98WA-059-001).  The 15-bar moisture is estimated to be 15 to 20 percent (air-dry), acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half iron of 1 to 3 percent; phosphate retention of 75 to 85 percent, and volcanic glass content of 5 to 30 percent.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
