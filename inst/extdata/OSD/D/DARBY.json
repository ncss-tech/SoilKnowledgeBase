The moisture control section is dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days after the summer solstice.  Depth to bedrock commonly is 60 to 80 inches but it is as shallow as 45 to 60 inches in some pedons.  Hue is from 10YR or 7.5YR.  The mollic epipedon is 30 to 60 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 10 percent gravel and cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry in the upper part and 2 through 4 moist and 3 through 5 dry in the lower part, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  This horizon is clay or silty clay, averaging 40 to 50 percent clay with 5 to 15 percent gravel and cobbles.\nThe BCt or C horizon is clay loam, loam, or silty clay loam with 5 to 15 percent gravel and cobbles."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from basalt of the Roseburg Formation.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and dry warm summers. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches.  Mean January temperature is 39 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 60 degrees F.; the average annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 160 to 235 days."
