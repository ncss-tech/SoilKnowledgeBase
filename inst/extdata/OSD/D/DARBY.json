  "OVERVIEW": "The Darby series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from basalt of the Roseburg Formation.  Darby soils are on mountainsides, fans and foot slopes and have slopes of 12 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

Hue is from 10YR or 7.5YR.  The mollic epipedon is 30 to 60 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 10 percent gravel and cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry in the upper part and 2 through 4 moist and 3 through 5 dry in the lower part, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  This horizon is clay or silty clay, averaging 40 to 50 percent clay with 5 to 15 percent gravel and cobbles.\nThe BCt or C horizon is clay loam, loam, or silty clay loam with 5 to 15 percent gravel and cobbles."
