Springbar soils average 15 to 30 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline reaction throughout.  Timmerman soils are dominated by coarse sands in the particle-size control section, have mean annual soil temperature of 10 to 13 degrees C., and have a frost-free period of 130 to 210 days."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Elevations range from 1,220 to 1,865 and are 700 to 1,630 meters in Idaho.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 180 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 80 to 130 days.  In Idaho, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 11 degrees C. and the frost-free period is 120 to 150 days."
