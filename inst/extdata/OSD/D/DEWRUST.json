  "OVERVIEW": "The Dewrust series consists of moderately deep over a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks with a component of volcanic ash.  The Dewrust soils are on fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 4 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.",
