  "OVERVIEW": "The Delnorte series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon. They are well drained soils that are, moderately rapidly permeable above and below a very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon.  They formed in calcareous loamy materials containing igneous gravel.  These soils are on nearly level hilly uplands, fan piedmonts, and fan remnants.  Slope ranges from 0 to 30 percent.",
