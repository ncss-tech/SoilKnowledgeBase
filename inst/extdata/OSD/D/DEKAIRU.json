  "STATES": "PB",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Dekairu Series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in basaltic and andesitic volcanic ash and cinders.  The Dekairu soils are on the dissected footslopes and backslopes of large remnant caldera rims and cinder covered `a`a lava plains of stratovolcanic islands.  Slopes range from 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 27 degrees C. (81 degrees F.), and the mean annual precipitation is about 2032 millimeters (80 inches).",
