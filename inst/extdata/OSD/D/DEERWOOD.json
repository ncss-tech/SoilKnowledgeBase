  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils commonly contain free carbonates in all parts, but in some pedons the organic soil material and A horizon lacks carbonates.  A few cobbles or stones are at the boundary of the mineral and organic surface layer in a few pedons.  The mineral soil material has as much as 35 percent rock fragments in a few pedons.\nThe O horizon in the rubbed condition has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or less.  The O horizon typically consists of sapric material throughout but in some pedons part of it is hemic material. The fiber typically is herbaceous, but in a few pedons part of it is woody.  Reaction typically is slightly alkaline but ranges to moderately acid in some parts of some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or less.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam or their mucky analogues.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has a matrix with hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has redoximorphic features in all parts.  It is coarse sand, sand, fine sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand or the gravelly analogs of these textures.  It commonly is stratified.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Deerwood soils have plane or slightly concave slopes with gradient of less than 1 percent in shallow depressions on glacial lake plains and glacial outwash plains.  These soils formed in a thin layer of organic soil material over sandy glacial lacustrine or outwash sediments.  The glacial sediments are of late Wisconsinan age.  The mean annual temperature is 36 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 28 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 140.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 850 to 1700 feet."

The poorly and very poorly drained Cormant and somewhat poorly drained Redby soils do not have a histic epipedon and commonly are in a drainage sequence with the Deerwood soils."

Depth to an apparent seasonal high water table is as high as +1.0 to 1.0 feet at some time from January to December in most years."
