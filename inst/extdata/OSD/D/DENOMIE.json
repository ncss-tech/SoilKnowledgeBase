Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 or 3.

Dobie soils have a paralithic contact with sandstone at 20 to 40 inches.  Doritty soils have redox features and saturation below 40 inches.  Otterholt soils have more than 45 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.  Odanah soils are in the fine family.  Watton soils are fine-loamy."

Many areas which were formally cropland are now idle and are reverting to natural vegetation.  Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest.  Common trees are red maple, sugar maple, yellow birch, American basswood, balsam fir, white spruce, red pine, white pine, quaking aspen, paper birch, and red oak.  Common understory species are American hazel, black snakeroot, big leaf aster, wild sarsaparilla, and bracken fern."
