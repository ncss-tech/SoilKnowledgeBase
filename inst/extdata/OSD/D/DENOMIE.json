    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 22 to 35 percent and the weighted average content of fine sand or coarser is less than 15 percent.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 2 percent throughout.  Some pedons do not have subhorizons with remnant discontinuous disoriented varves or mudflow lenses.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 to 3.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction naturally ranges from very strongly to slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nDenomie soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizon or both).  The E/B horizon, where present, ranges up to 4 inches thick.  The E part has color like the E horizon described above.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value of 3 or 4.  It is typically silty clay loam or clay loam but in some pedons it is silt loam.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value of 3 or 4.  It is typically silty clay loam or clay loam but in some pedons it is silt loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value of 4 or 5.  It is typically silty clay loam or clay loam but in some pedons it is silt loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with color, texture, and reaction like the Btk horizon described above."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Campia, Dobie, Doritty, Otterholt, and Wickware series.  Closely related soils are the Odanah(T) and Watton series.  None of these soils except, Odanah and Watton, have free carbonates within the series control section.  In addition, Campia soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section.  Dobie soils have a paralithic contact with sandstone at 20 to 40 inches.  Doritty soils have redox features and saturation below 40 inches.  Otterholt soils have more than 45 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.  Odanah soils are in the fine family.  Watton soils are fine-loamy."

These soils formed in silty and loamy till derived from silty and loamy lacustrine deposits.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges about from 90 to 120 days.  Elevation ranges from 600 to 1200 feet."

The well drained Bohemian soils, the somewhat poorly drained Brimley soils, and the poorly drained Bruce soils form a drainage sequence on nearby areas where the soil is formed in stratified lacustrine deposits.  The moderately well drained Gichigami soils and the somewhat poorly drained Oronto soils form a drainage sequence with Denomie soils."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for woodland.  Some areas are used for cropland and pastureland.  Oats, bromegrass, timothy, and alfalfa are the principle crops.  Many areas which were formally cropland are now idle and are reverting to natural vegetation.  Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest.  Common trees are red maple, sugar maple, yellow birch, American basswood, balsam fir, white spruce, red pine, white pine, quaking aspen, paper birch, and red oak.  Common understory species are American hazel, black snakeroot, big leaf aster, wild sarsaparilla, and bracken fern."
