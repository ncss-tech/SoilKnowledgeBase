  "OVERVIEW": "The Dolus series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum or colluvium from semiconsolidated interbedded sandstone or siltstone.  These soils are on hills and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
