Bushvalley soils have hues of 7.5YR or redder in the argillic horizon.  Bushvalley and Nielsen are noncalcareous above lithic contact and have precipitation of 16 inches or more.  Genoa soils are noncalcareous above lithic contact and have an average annual soil temperature of 44 to 47 degrees F.  Hogmalat soils have 24 to 34 percent clay in the control section and average summer soil temperatures of 54 to 57 degrees F.  Layview soils have an average soil temperature of 43 to 45 and lack carbonates above the bedrock.  Mosroc soils are 18 to 35 percent clay and are noneffervescent above the bedrock.  Copenhaver and Nieman soils have an ustic soil moisture regime.  Maygal soils are slightly acid to neutral and have a mean summer soil temperature of 54 to 59 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Donkehill soils are on foothills, mountainsides and ridges and have slopes of 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 6,500 to 9,000 feet.  The soils formed in residuum and slope alluvium weathered from felsic volcanic rocks.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring, and cool and dry to moist in summer.  Average annual precipitation is 13 to 18 inches.  Average annual temperature is 34 to 38 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
