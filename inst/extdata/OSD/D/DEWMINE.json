    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 6 to 19 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments make up 25 to 50 percent of the control section, but average greater than 35 percent.  The soil, from a depth of about 5 inches down to bedrock, is usually moist in some part for 160 to 180 days from October 15 to May 1.  It is dry in all parts for 45 to 90 days from July 1 to September 30.  The mean annual soil temperature is 39 to 47 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 3/1, 4/1, 5/2, 5/3, or 2.5Y 5/2 and moist color of 10YR 2/1, 3/1, 3/2 or 2.5Y 2/2.  It is loam or clay loam with 15 to 30 percent clay modified by 15 to 10 percent pebbles, stones or cobbles.  It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 5/4, 3/3, 3/2, or 2.5Y 5/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3 inclusive or 2.5Y 2/2.  It is heavy clay loam or clay and averages 35 to 45 percent clay modified by 35 to 50 percent pebbles, stones, or cobbles.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline."
