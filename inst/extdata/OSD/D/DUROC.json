  "OVERVIEW": "The Duroc series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy alluvium and eolian deposits in draws, swales, and on stream terraces in the Central High Tableland (MLRA 72). Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 41 centimeters (16 inches).  The average annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. (46 degrees F.), at the type location.",
