  "OVERVIEW": "The Darmstadt series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on till plains. They formed in loess, or in loess and the underlying pedisediment. These soils contain a concentration of exchangeable sodium in the subsoil. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 965 millimeters (38 inches).",
