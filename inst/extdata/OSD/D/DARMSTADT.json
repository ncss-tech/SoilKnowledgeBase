  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Darmstadt soils are on interfluves, convex summits, and in upland drainageways on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent. These soils contain a concentration of exchangeable sodium in the subsoil. These soils typically formed in loess, or in loess and the underlying silty pedisediment. The material beneath the loess is Illinoian-age till or the silty erosional sediments that lie above the till and contains a component of sand. The loess is late Wisconsinan-age Peoria Loess and the underlying silty material is early Wisconsinan-age Roxana Silt. The till commonly contains a strongly developed paleosol. Mean annual temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C (53 to 57 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1067 millimeters (36 to 42 inches). Frost-free period is 175 to 200 days. Elevation is 122 to 229 meters (400 to 750 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cisne, Cowden, Coulterville, Grantfork, Herrick, Hoyleton, Huey, Oconee, Piasa, and Tamalco soils. The poorly drained Cisne, Cowden, Huey, and Piasa soils are on broad, nearly level interfluves. Cisne and Cowden soils are in fine-textured families and do not have a natric horizon. The somewhat poorly drained Coulterville soils contain a concentration of exchangeable sodium in the subsoil, but do not have a natric horizon, and are on similar landforms nearby. The somewhat poorly drained Grantfork soils contain a concentration of exchangeable sodium in the subsoil and are on side slopes below the Darmstadt soils. The somewhat poorly drained Herrick, Hoyleton, and Oconee soils are in fine-textured families and do not have a natric horizon. Hoyleton and Oconee soils are in a complex pattern with Darmstadt soils on the landscape in most places. The moderately well drained Tamalco soils are in a fine-textured family, have a natric horizon, and are on positions slightly higher on the landform."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low. Permeability is very slow. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to very high. In drained areas, depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 15 to 61 centimeters (0.5 foot to 2.0 feet) from December to April in normal years."
