  "REVDATE": "11/2013",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Doss series consists of shallow to weakly cemented limestone, well drained, moderately slow permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy and clayey residuum derived from marls and limestone. These very gently to moderately sloping soils occur on hill slopes on dissected plateaus. Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 18.9 degrees C (66 degrees F).",
