  "OVERVIEW": "The Dutchman series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived from sedimentary formations high in gypsum.  Dutchman soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.",
