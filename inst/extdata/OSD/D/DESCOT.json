  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at depth 20 inches ranges from 43 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature ranges from 62 to 64 degrees F.  The soils are dry in parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 days during the winter, and are dry in all parts of the moisture control section 50 to 65 percent of the time when the soil temperature at depth of 20 inches is more than 41 degrees F.  The calcium carbonate equivalent is 40 to 50 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 6 to 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, chroma of 4 to 6 dry or moist.  The texture ranges from silt loam to very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have thin lenses of loamy sand 1 to 5 inches thick.  The particle size control section averages less than 18 percent clay and 15 to 30 percent sand coarser than very fine.  The C horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

They are on alluvial valley fill and formed in alluvium from sandstone and limestone alluvium.  The climate is semi-arid, the average annual precipitation is 9 to 14 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F., and the freeze-free period is 70 to 100 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Descot soils were previously classified as Torrifluvents, but are on relatively stable, nonflooding landscapes and lack the irregular decrease in organic matter required for that placement.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 5 inches (A horizon)\nOrthent feature - lack of diagnostic horizons below the ochric and regular decrease in organic matter\nUstic feature - dry in some or all parts of the moisture control section for 90 or more days cumulative, but not dry in all parts more than half the time that the soil temperature at 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
