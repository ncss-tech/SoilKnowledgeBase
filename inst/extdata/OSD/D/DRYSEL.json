    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F. These soils are dry in the moisture control section more than half the time that the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. (about 105 to 130 days). The particle-size control section has 25 to 35 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 2 to 25 percent coarse fragments. Organic matter content is estimated to range from 1 to 2 percent. Solum thickness and depth to duripan is 20 to 40 inches. Depth to secondary carbonates is 15 to 30 inches. Depth to bedrock is typically 60 inches or more but pedons on the upper ends of fans have bedrock of 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A and AB horizons have value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It has weak or moderate structure. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt and Btk horizons have value of 5 to 8 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist. The Bt is loam, silty clay loam, or silt loam. The Btk is clay loam, gravelly clay loam, loam or gravelly loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. The Btk horizon has 5 to 20 percent calcium carbonate.\nThe 2Bkqm horizon is indurated, has gravelly to extremely gravelly matrix 8 to 36 inches thick with 1 to 5 inches thick silica plates and is above stratified weakly to indurated alluvial material."

Arbidge soils have sand and gravel below a 2 to 8 inch thick duripan at depths of 22 to more than 44 inches and mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 52 degrees F. Dacker soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 52 degrees F. Ditchcamp soils are slightly acid or neutral with no free lime above the duripan. Exel soils have Bt horizons with hue of 7.5YR or 5YR and lack free lime above the duripan. Hager soils have annual temperature of 47 to 50 degrees, have brittle layers above the duripan and have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches. Idow soils have a calcic horizon. Rokane soils are neutral in the argillic horizon and have a mean annual soil temperature of 49 to 51 degrees F. Snowmore soils have a duripan directly above bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Wako soils have a calcic horizon and 5 to 30 percent silica cemented durinodes. Wellsed soils receive summer precipitation and are strongly or very strongly alkaline. Wendell soils have duripan directly above the bedrock and have 18 to 26 percent clay in the particle-size control section."
