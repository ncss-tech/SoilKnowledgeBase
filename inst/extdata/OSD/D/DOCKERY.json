  "OVERVIEW": "The Dockery series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately or moderately slowly permeable soils formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains and slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 54 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.",

It is silt loam or silty clay loam and moderately acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 3. Iron masses have hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 8. Texture typically is silt loam or silty clay loam. Some pedons are loam or sandy loam below a depth of 36 inches. It is moderately acid in the upper part to moderately alkaline in the lower part. Carbonates occur below depths of 20 inches in some pedons. Some pedons have a clayey substratum."
