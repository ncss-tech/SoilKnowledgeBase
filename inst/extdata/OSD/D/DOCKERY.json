  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam or silty clay loam and moderately acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 3. Iron masses have hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 8. Texture typically is silt loam or silty clay loam. Some pedons are loam or sandy loam below a depth of 36 inches. It is moderately acid in the upper part to moderately alkaline in the lower part. Carbonates occur below depths of 20 inches in some pedons. Some pedons have a clayey substratum."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. Similar soils are the Blake, Gilliam, and Nodaway series. Blake and Gilliam soils contain free carbonates above 20 inches. Nodaway soils do not have mottles with chroma of 2 or less within 20 inches of the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dockery soils are on flood plains and formed in alluvium. Slope gradients are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 42 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the better drained Napier soils as well as the more poorly drained Colo, Portage, Wabash and Zook soils. Napier soils are on adjacent foot slopes and alluvial fans. Colo, Portage, Wabash and Zook soils are on slightly lower positions on the flood plains."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",

Fluventic feature - an irregular decrease in organic matter.\nThese soils are prime farmland except where frequently flooded during the growing season.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
