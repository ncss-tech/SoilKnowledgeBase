  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to carbonates ranges from 18 to 28 inches.  The thickness of the upper sediment over glacial till is 15 to 30 inches.  The control section averages between 18 to 27 percent clay and 15 to 25 percent sand coarser than very fine.  The content of clay commonly is higher in the A horizon than in the B horizon.  The content of sand coarser than very fine is about 5 to 15 percent in the upper sediment and about 20 to 35 percent in the glacial till.  Coarse fragments of mixed lithology typically are lacking in the upper sediment but the glacial till commonly contains about 1 to 8 percent by volume.  A thin pebble band is at the contact of the two sediments in some pedons.  These soils are not continuously saturated with water in the mottled horizon for as long as 90 days in most years.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 and sometimes 2 in the lower part.  It is silt loam or loam high in content of very fine sand.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  An AB horizon as thick as 6 inches is in some pedons.\nThe B horizon in the silty sediment has hue of 10YR in the upper part and 10YR or 2.5Y in the lower part.  It has value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is neutral or slightly acid.  Some pedons have a Bk horizon.\nThe 2B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have 2Bk horizons.\nThe 2C horizons have value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 4. It lacks mottles in some pedons.  It is loam or clay loam.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.  It has calcium carbonate equivalent of 12 to 35 percent.\nA thin C horizon in the silty sediment is in some pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Barnes, Edgeley, Formdale, Hibar, Prospect, Vienna, and Yeoman series in the same family and the closely related Tara series.  All of these series except for Tara lack or have a thinner upper silty mantle.  In addition, the Hibar soils have a lithic contact and the Vienna soils have firm consistence in the 2B and 2C horizons.  The Tara soils have thicker mollic epipedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Doland soils have plane or slightly convex slopes on level or undulating glacial moraines.  Slopes range from 0 to 18 percent in gradient.  They formed in a mantle of silty sediments and loamy, calcareous, glacial till of Late Wisconsinan Age or entirely in the silty mantle.  The silty sediments are primarily loess, but in some places they are lacustrine.  The mean annual temperature is about 43 to 48 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 20 to 24 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Tara, McIntosh, Perella, and Quam soils, which are members of drainage sequence with Doland soils.  Moderately well drained Tara soils are downslope. Moderately well and somewhat poorly drained McIntosh soils are on low rises.  Poorly drained Perella soils are on nearby level terrain.  Very poorly drained Quam soils are in depressions.  All of those soils formed in thicker silty sediments than Doland soils."
