At that time the series was defined as having a udic soil moisture regime.  This udic correlation is based on the native vegetation being aspen.  In the past the soil may have been correlated as having a xeric soil moisture regime as the moisture regime in older versions of the description was not identified.  Review of map unit components in previously correlated soil surveys is needed.  In 1978 the series was defined as deep to a lithic contact.  In 1980 the series was re-defined to be deep and very deep to bedrock thus some of the competing series criteria are minimal.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nTypical pedon was not sampled.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
