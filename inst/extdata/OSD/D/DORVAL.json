  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the organic material commonly is 24 to 42 inches, but ranges from 16 to 50 inches. The organic material above the mineral C horizon is from woody, herbaceous, or mixed vegetation. Many pedons contain fragments of twigs, branches, or logs ranging from 1/8 to 5 inches in diameter and up to 15 percent of the volume. The organic portion of the control section ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline and lacks free carbonates. The mineral soil substratum ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe surface tier has hue of 5YR through 10YR or is neutral, has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2. Exclusive of loose surface litter or mosses, it is sapric or hemic material with an unrubbed fiber content that ranges from 20 to 50 percent.\nThe subsurface tier has colors similar to the surface tier. It is dominantly sapric material, but thin hemic layers are common. Unrubbed fiber content ranges from about 20 to 90 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 2.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 6. Texture is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam. Thin layers in some pedons have more sand or silt and less clay. Rock fragments are usually absent but range to 5 percent by volume in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. The Carbondale, Cathro, Dora, Lupton, Markey, Ossipee, Rondeau, Seeleyville, and Willette series are in closely related families. Carbondale, Lupton, and Seeleyville soils do not have a mineral layer 12 inches or more thick that has its upper boundary in the control section below the surface tier. Cathro and Markey soils have less than 35 percent clay in the 2C horizon. Dora soils are morphologically similar, but have 2C horizons within the control section that are dominated by montmorillonitic mineralogy. Ossipee soils are dominated by hemic material and have a dysic reaction class. Rondeau soils have marly 2C horizons within the control section. Willette soils are similar, but have a mesic temperature regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dorval soils are in depressions within till plains and lake and marine plains. The slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in organic materials resulting from the decomposition of woody and herbaceous vegetation. Mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 42 inches, and mean annual frost-free days ranges from 120 to 150 days. Elevation ranges from 200 to 900 feet above sea level."

The Adjidaumo, Munuscong, Swanton, and Searsport soils are mineral soils on slightly higher landscape positions. Carbondale soils larger or deeper depressional positions where organic material accumulation is thicker."
