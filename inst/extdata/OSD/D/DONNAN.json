  "REVDATE": "02/2005",
  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Donnan series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 50 to 91 centimeters (20 to 36 inches) of loamy sediments and the underlying highly weathered paleosol that developed in glacial till. These soils are on convex ridges and side slopes on dissected till plains. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 81 centimeters (32 inches).",
