  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for more than half the time (cumulative) that the soil temperature at 20 inches is above 41 degrees F., and are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches during the summer months for 60 consecutive days in most years.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 12 to 20 inches.  Free lime occurs at depths of 10 to 18 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 10 inches thick.  The amount of rock fragments range from 20 to about 35 percent.  Amount of fragments larger than 3 inches ranges from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  It ranges from heavy loam and clay loam to sandy clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay and more than 15 percent fragments coarser than very fine sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Donnybrook soils are at elevations of 2,500 to 4,000 feet on south-facing sloping to steep upland with slope gradients ranging from 10 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in shallow medium and moderately fine textured colluvium over siltstone, sandstone, conglomerate and tuffaceous materials.  Mean annual precipitation is 11 to 14 inches, mean annual temperature is 44 to 51 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 61 to 64 degrees F., and mean winter temperature is 30 to 35 degrees F.  The average frost-free (32 degrees F.) period is 60 to 80 days."
