  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 degrees to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is about 62 degrees to 68 degrees F. There is an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth. These soils are weakly stratified (visually) with thin strata of silt loam, silts, and silty clays; discontinuous strata are only about 1/8 to 1/2 inch thick within otherwise uniform sediments. There are no coarse fragments in the soil profile.  Carbonates range from 10 to 20 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist; and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist. It is silt loam or silty clay loam with less than 20 percent total sand and less than 5 percent coarser than very fine sand. Clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent. E. C.  ranges from 8 to 16 mmhols/cm. E. S. P. ranges from 5 to 15 percent.  Reaction ranges from moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline, lower pH readings only occur when gypsum buffering is present.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist; and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist. The C horizon comprises the particle size control section for the series. It is a silt loam or silty clay loam. Clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 45 to 80 percent, and sand less than 20 percent with less than 5 percent being coarser than very fine sand. E. C. is 20 to 50 mmhos/ cm in most subhorizons of the C. E. S. P. ranges from 20 to over 100 percent in most parts of this horizon. Reaction ranges from strongly alkaline to very strongly alkaline with lower values being the result of gypsum buffering."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dines soils are on alluvial terraces, fans, and pediment toeslopes of the early Holocene epoch. Slopes are typically less than 1 percent but range from 0 to 3 percent. Elevations range from 6,000 to 7,000 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches with peak amounts in April, May, and June and trace amounts in July, August, September, and October. The mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is about 80 to 110 days."
