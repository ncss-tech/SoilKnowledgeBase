Rock fragments are mostly gravel size chert and range from 0 to 15 percent in each horizon.  Some horizons range up to 25 percent below 40 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  A few undisturbed areas have a thin A horizon with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Severely eroded areas also have hue of 2.5YR and chroma of 6.  Texure is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam and severely eroded areas range to clay loam, silty clay or clay.\nSome pedons have a transitional horizon or E horizon between the A horizon and the Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 6 or 8.  Moist value is 4 or more in some subhorizon in the upper 40 inches.  Variegations are in shades of brown, yellow, and red.  The texture is silty clay or clay, except the upper part is silty clay loam or clay loam in some pedons."

Henderson and Marlboro soils have a higher component of sand and colors dominantly in hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.  Fullerton soils have more than 15 percent chert fragments in the particle-size control section.  Lugoff soils have rock lithology of quartz.  Summerton and Waynesboro soils have a higher sand and lower silt content throughout. Additionally, Waynesboro soils formed entirely in old alluvium."
