    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the A and Bt horizons is 14 to 28 inches.  Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The soil is usually moist but is dry from mid May until October.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 3/3, 4/3, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3; 7.5YR 2.5/2, 3/4, 4/2, 4/4, 5/2, 5/4; 5YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4; 7.5YR 2.5/2, 3/2, 3/4, 4/2, 4/4; 5YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4 value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3 moist are only in the upper part of the A horizon.  It is loam or clay loam modified by rock fragments.  It typically has granular or subangular blocky structure but some pedons have platy structure in the upper part.  Organic matter content is 10 percent in the upper part and 4 percent in the lower part of the A horizon.  Some pedons have an AB horizon.  Rock fragments consist of stones, cobbles and gravel and range from 20 to 50 percent.\nThe Bt horizon color is 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/2, 4/4, 5/2, 5/4, 6/4; 5YR 3/4, 3/3, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 4/6, 5/6.

It has angular blocky subangular blocky or prismatic structure.  Base saturation is greater than 75 percent by sum of cations.  Cobbles and pebbles range from 35 to 75 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dubakella soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 5 to 75 percent.  The soil formed in materials weathered from serpentine or serpentinitic bedrock.  Elevations are 2,200 to 4,100 feet.  In some areas as much as 50 percent of the surface is covered by cobbles or stones.  Rock outcrops are also common.  The climate is subhumid with warm to hot dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 20 to 60 inches.  Some precipitation occurs as snow on the higher ridges and in more northern areas.  Seasonal snowfall ranges from a few inches to about 24 inches.  In the high winter rainfall interior mountains of southwestern Oregon, the mean annual precipitation may range to 100 inches. Mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.; mean January temperature is about 32 degrees F.; mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F.  Frost-free season averages about 90 to 200 days."
