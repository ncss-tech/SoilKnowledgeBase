(Bw and part of Bk horizons)\nMollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 25 cm.  (A horizon)\nCambic horizon:  The zone from 25 to 41 cm.  (Bw horizon)\nCalcic horizon:  The zone from 41 to 104 cm.  (Bk horizon)\nEntic feature:  These soils are noneffervescent in the upper 18 to 25 cm and increase to strongly or violently effervescent in the calcic horizon.  They have free carbonates throughout the cambic horizon or in all parts of the mollic epipedon below a depth of 25 cm from the mineral soil surface.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nIn October 2000, taxonomic classification was converted to the closest match found in Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition 1999. Some update was made to horizon nomenclature, competing series section, etc. Other placements may be more appropriate after a complete update.\nIn May 2008, the type location was moved to Carbon County, Utah, and the series concept was extensively revised.\nThese soils were formerly classified as Calcisols."
