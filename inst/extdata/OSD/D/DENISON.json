  "OVERVIEW": "The Denison series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils developed from moderately fine textured granitic alluvium.  The Denison soils occur on low terraces adjacent to the coast in central California.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",
