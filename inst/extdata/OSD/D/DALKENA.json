  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dalkena soils are on glacial lake terraces.  They developed in glaciofluvial deposits over glacial lake sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent.  Elevations range from 2,000 to 3,000 feet.  These soils occur in a continental climate having warm, dry summers, and cold, moist winters.  Average January temperature is about 27 degrees F; average July air temperature is about 67 degrees F; and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 45 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 30 inches.  Frost-free  season ranges from 90 to 110 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the surface to 8 inches, a cambic horizon from 8 to 24 inches, and a lithologic discontinuity to clayey sediments at 30 inches.  The upper 14 inches of this pedon is estimated to have 5 to 20 percent volcanic glass and acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent.
