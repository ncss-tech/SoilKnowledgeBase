These soils are dry in the moisture control section more than half of the time  when the soil temperature at the duripan is above 40 degrees F. Mollic epipedon thickness ranges from 7 to 12 inches.  Organic matter is estimated to range from 1 to 2 percent.  Depth to the duripan ranges from 10 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, chroma of 3 through 5 dry or moist. It is extremely gravelly clay, very gravelly clay loam, very cobbly clay or very cobbly clay loam. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bqkm horizon is indurated, has gravelly to extremely gravelly matrix, is 8 to 36 thick with 1 to 5 inch thick plates and is above a weakly cemented to weakly indurated alluvium."
