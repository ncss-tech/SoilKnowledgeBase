  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 12 to 24 inches.  The soil is typically strongly acid to neutral. Sand grains immediately below the mollic epipedon are uncoated.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. The lower part of the A horizon commonly has distinct or prominent mottles.  Some pedons have thin layers and/or pockets of dark concretions (iron and manganese oxides) in the lower part of the A horizon.  The A horizon generally is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand or sandy loam, but ranges to include sandy clay loam.\nThe C1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles, when present, have hue of 10YR to 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is typically fine sand or sand but ranges to loamy sand or coarse sand.\nThe C2 and subsequent horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6.  It typically is fine sand or sand but coarse sand is within the range. Some pedons have thin horizons and pockets of loamy material or thin horizons or pockets of concretions and masses of iron and manganese below 40 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Diehlstadt soils are on nearly level and slightly depressional areas adjacent to old natural levees.  They formed in sandy alluvial sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 58 to 62 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 44 to 50 inches."

Canalou, Clana, Malden, and Scotco soils do not have mollic epipedon, are better drained, and are on higher nearby landscapes.  Lilbourn soils are coarse-loamy, do not have a mollic epipedon, and are on slightly higher landscape positions."

Native vegetation was water-tolerant hardwoods such as baldcypress and water tupelo with understories of rushes, sedges, and grasses."
