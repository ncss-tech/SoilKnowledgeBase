Unless limed, reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid in the A horizon and from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the B and C horizons.  Flakes of mica range from few to common throughout the solum and C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Where the value is 3 or less the horizon thickness is less than 10 inches.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam, and includes sandy clay loam or clay loam in eroded areas   Volume of pebbles range from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe BE or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bt1 and Bt2 horizons have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 4 through 8.  There are none to common masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown and iron depletions in shades of gray are in the Bt2 horizon.  The Bt3 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 through 8.  It has none to many masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown and iron depletions in shades of gray.  Texture of the Bt horizon is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam in the upper part and ranges to include clay below the control section.  Volume of pebbles range from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe Btg, 2Btg, BCg, or 2BCg horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  There are none to many masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown and yellow and iron depletions in shades of gray, are throughout these horizons.  Some pedons are mottled in shades of gray, brown, and yellow.  They are loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or clay.  Volume of pebbles range from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe C or 2C horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 8.  They have common to many masses of iron accumulation in shades of red, brown, and yellow and iron depletions in shades of gray, or they are mottled in the same colors. Texture is variable.  Volume of pebbles ranges from 0 to 35 percent.\nThe Cg or 2Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Common to many masses of iron accumulation in shades of red, brown, and yellow, and iron depletions in shades of gray, may occur throughout the horizon. Texture is variable.  Volume of pebbles range from 0 to 35 percent.  A 2Cr horizon is present in some pedons below a depth of 40 inches."

Adelphia and Holmdel soils contain glauconite.  Blairton soils have bedrock at less than 40 inches.  Brumbaugh(T), Fenwick, Mattapex, Wharton, and Woodstown soils do not have flakes of mica in the soil profile; and in addition Fenwick soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Cana soils have upper horizons formed from glacial till and contain glacial erratics.  Catoca soils have thinner sola and lack flakes of mica.  DeLanco soils have common to many flakes of mica in the Bt horizon and have stratified BC and C horizons.  Tuscarawas soils have more than 10 percent coarse fragments in the upper part of the solum."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The distribution and extent of the Dillard series has been broadened due to the recognition of a mesic soil temperature regime in some areas of the Southern Piedmont.  The 2/99 revision updates classification to 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy (1998) and places this soil in a semiactive CEC activity class based on similar soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to approximately 8 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from approximately 8 to 55 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, 2Btg, and 2BCg horizons)\nAquic feature - iron depletions of chroma 2 or less are within 24 inches of the upper boundary of the argillic horizon.  The zone from 20 to 62 inches.  (Bt2, Bt3, 2Btg, 2BCg, and 2Cg horizons)\nRevised 2/99\nSIR = GA0061\nMLRA = 130\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
