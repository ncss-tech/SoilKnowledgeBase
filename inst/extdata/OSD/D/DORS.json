  "OVERVIEW": "The Dors series consists of very deep, well-drained soils on fan\nterraces.  They formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Permeability is\nmoderately rapid.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  The average annual\nprecipitation is about 7 inches, and the average annual temperature is\nabout 52 degrees F.",
