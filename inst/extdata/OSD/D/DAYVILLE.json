  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is 65 to 72 degrees F. The soil is saturated with water at some period of the year. Depth to distinct or prominent redox concentrations is 24 inches or more. The soil is calcareous in the A horizon and the upper part of the AC horizon but is noncalcareous in some part between depths of 10 and 20 inches. Depth to contrasting textured material ranges from 15 to 36 inches. The upper part of the particle-size control section is silt loam or silty clay loam and has thin layers of loam or sandy loam in some pedons. It averages 18 to 30 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  The lower part is loamy sand or sand with 0 to 5 percent clay and over 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe AC and C horizons have value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry."

The soils formed in stratified recent alluvium of mixed origin. The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cold moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 63 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 150 days."
