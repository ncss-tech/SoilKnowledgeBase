  "OVERVIEW": "The Dayville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in stratified mixed alluvium. Dayville soils are on level or gently sloping alluvial flood plains or low alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The soil is saturated with water at some period of the year. Depth to distinct or prominent redox concentrations is 24 inches or more. The soil is calcareous in the A horizon and the upper part of the AC horizon but is noncalcareous in some part between depths of 10 and 20 inches. Depth to contrasting textured material ranges from 15 to 36 inches. The upper part of the particle-size control section is silt loam or silty clay loam and has thin layers of loam or sandy loam in some pedons. It averages 18 to 30 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  The lower part is loamy sand or sand with 0 to 5 percent clay and over 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe AC and C horizons have value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry."
