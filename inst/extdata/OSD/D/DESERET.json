  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 51 to 56 degrees F. The mean summer temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 69 to 72 degrees F.  In most years the soils are saturated for a period of time from a depth of 48 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It ranges from sandy loam through silty clay loam. The A horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe By horizon has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. They are dominantly silty clay loam, loam, and silt loam, in some pedons thin lenses of sandy loam occur.  These horizons average between 18 and 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  The gypsic horizons occur at depths of 8 to 60 inches and mottles may occur at depths of 30 inches or greater.  The By horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline. The By horizon contains 5 to 25 percent gypsum, and averages 15 to 20 percent gypsum."

The soils formed in lacustrine and deltaic sediments and alluvium from mixed parent material.  The climate is semiarid, with an average annual precipitation of 8 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 70 to 73 degrees F. The frost free season is 115 to 150 days."
