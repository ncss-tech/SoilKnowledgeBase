  "OVERVIEW": "The Deseret series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils.  These soils formed in deltaic and lacustrine sediments and alluvium from mixed sedimentary material on floodplains and lake terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is 52 degrees F.",

In most years the soils are saturated for a period of time from a depth of 48 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It ranges from sandy loam through silty clay loam. The A horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe By horizon has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. They are dominantly silty clay loam, loam, and silt loam, in some pedons thin lenses of sandy loam occur.  These horizons average between 18 and 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  The gypsic horizons occur at depths of 8 to 60 inches and mottles may occur at depths of 30 inches or greater.  The By horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline. The By horizon contains 5 to 25 percent gypsum, and averages 15 to 20 percent gypsum."
