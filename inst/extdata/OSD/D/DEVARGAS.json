They formed in alluvium derived from granitic sandstone over alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, schist and monzonite.  Slopes are 1 to 5 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 7,400 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."

Delvalle soils are coarse-loamy, do not have argillic horizons, and are on adjacent treads of topographically lower stream terraces.  Panky soils have upper argillic horizons with more than 35 percent clay, have calcic horizons, and are on summits of erosional fan remnants.  Riovista soils are sandy-skeletal, do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons, and occur on low stream terraces."
