The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F..  Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon and depth to carbonates is 20 to 30 inches thick.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 30 percent clay.  Depth to segregated calcium carbonate is 30 to 44 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of  2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It contains 15 to 30 percent gravel.  It has 5 to 20 percent glass with acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron of 0.5 to 1.0.\nThe AB horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam or sandy loam and contains 35 to 60 percent gravel, and 0 to 25 percent sand-size pumice.\nThe Bk1 horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam and contains 40 to 60 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobbles.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline and is slightly to strongly effervescent.\nThe Bk2 horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is  loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam and contains 40 to 70 percent gravel and 10 to 30 percent cobbles. It is moderately to strongly alkaline and is strongly to violently effervescent."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:   Drakebutte soils are on buttes at elevations of 3,500 to 4,300 feet.  Slopes range from 8 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from andesite with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface. Climate is characterized by cold moist winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches, the mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
