  "OVERVIEW": "The Drakebutte series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from andesite with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  Drakebutte soils are on buttes and have slopes of 8 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F..  Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon and depth to carbonates is 20 to 30 inches thick.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 30 percent clay.  Depth to segregated calcium carbonate is 30 to 44 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of  2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It contains 15 to 30 percent gravel.  It has 5 to 20 percent glass with acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron of 0.5 to 1.0.\nThe AB horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam or sandy loam and contains 35 to 60 percent gravel, and 0 to 25 percent sand-size pumice.\nThe Bk1 horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam and contains 40 to 60 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobbles.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline and is slightly to strongly effervescent.\nThe Bk2 horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is  loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam and contains 40 to 70 percent gravel and 10 to 30 percent cobbles. It is moderately to strongly alkaline and is strongly to violently effervescent."
