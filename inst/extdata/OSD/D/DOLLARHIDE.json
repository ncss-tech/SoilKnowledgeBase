  "OVERVIEW": "The Dollarhide series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in loess and residuum and colluvium from quartzitic sandstone and related rocks. Dollarhide soils are on mountainsides and foothills and have slopes of 15 to 75 percent. Permeability is moderately rapid. The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

Arrowpeak and Schwacheim soils have a udic moisture regime. Cheadle and Starley soils are calcareous. Clamp soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Dalys soils are very shallow. Eyre soils have no Bw horizon. Irigul, Irson, Labshaft, and Starley soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Jonlake and Topeki soils have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Milling soils have a high ash content. Chokecherry and Poin soils have an ustic moisture regime. Rogert soils have no Bw horizon and have more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand. Udel soils are usually less than 10 inches deep and do not have a Bw horizon."

Elevation ranges from 5,200 to 9,250 feet. The soil formed in loess and residuum and colluvium from quartzitic sandstone, quartzitic metamorphic, intermediate intrusive, and related rock. The average annual precipitation is 16 to 24 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rains. The average annual temperature is 36 to 41 degrees F. The frost-free season is less than 70 days."
