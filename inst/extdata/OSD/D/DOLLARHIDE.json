(When described on October 2, 1978, the soil was slightly moist throughout. Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)\nA--0 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very very fine and fine interstitial pores; about 40 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)\nBw--7 to 13 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely cobbly fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; common very fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; about 15 percent gravel and 50 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (3 to 12 inches thick)\n2R1--13 to 23 inches; quartzite bedrock. Fractured vertically and horizontally in place with less than 5 percent soil material in fractures (1 to 2mm wide); common very fine and fine roots constricted along fracture planes. (0 to 10 inches thick)\n2R2--23 inches; unfractured quartzite bedrock."

Arrowpeak and Schwacheim soils have a udic moisture regime. Cheadle and Starley soils are calcareous. Clamp soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Dalys soils are very shallow. Eyre soils have no Bw horizon. Irigul, Irson, Labshaft, and Starley soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Jonlake and Topeki soils have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Milling soils have a high ash content. Chokecherry and Poin soils have an ustic moisture regime. Rogert soils have no Bw horizon and have more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand. Udel soils are usually less than 10 inches deep and do not have a Bw horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dollarhide soils are on north and east facing mountain slopes, foothills, and on ridges. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,200 to 9,250 feet. The soil formed in loess and residuum and colluvium from quartzitic sandstone, quartzitic metamorphic, intermediate intrusive, and related rock. The average annual precipitation is 16 to 24 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rains. The average annual temperature is 36 to 41 degrees F. The frost-free season is less than 70 days."
