  "OVERVIEW": "The Dagflat series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum.  The Dagflat soils are on mountain slopes.  Slope ranges from 30 to 60 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 15 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 47 to 54 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature from 65 to 70 degrees F.  The soils are usually dry during the period the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  They are moist in some parts of the moisture control section for 30 to 40 days during the summer months and are dry for 70 to 85 days during the 120 days following the winter solstice.\nThe mollic epipedon is 10 to 19 inches thick.  The solum is 21 to 40 inches thick. The soils are slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It ranges from very cobbly sandy clay loam or coarse sandy clay loam to very cobbly loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is dominantly coarse sandy clay but ranges to clay or coarse sandy clay loam and averages more than 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches.  The horizon has moderate to strong, medium to coarse prismatic structure.  Thin to moderately thick clay films and slickensides occur on many faces of peds.\nThe C horizon is coarse sandy loam or loamy sand and consists of somewhat weathered parent material that is very hard but can be cut with a spade."

Ascalon, Capulin, Carnero, Harlan, Kirtley, Rosebud, Satanta, Wages and Wolf soils are calcareous in some part of above depth of 40 inches and have continuous horizons of calcium carbonate accumulation.  Hargreave and Lavate soils lack a lithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches."
