    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 34 to 38 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature ranges from 40 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are noncalcareous throughout.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section has 18 to 27 percent clay, 20 to 45 percent silt and 40 to 65 percent sand.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 15 percent in the A and B horizons and 10 to 25 percent in the C horizon.  They are less than 3 inches in diameter and dominantly less than 1 inch in diameter.  The soil ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid in the subsurface layers.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bw horizon has color and texture similar to the A horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4."

The soils formed in residuum and alluvium from basaltic materials.  Mean annual precipitation is 28 to 40 inches, the majority of which falls as snow.  Mean annual temperature is 32 to 38 degrees F.  Elevations range from 10,000 to 11,500 feet."

In addition, the Angostura soils have argillic horizons. Causewa soils have loamy-skeletal, particle-size control sections and Packtrail soils have bedrock above a depth of 40 inches."
