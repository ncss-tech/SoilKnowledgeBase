  "OVERVIEW": "The Domo series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in basaltic materials.  These soils are on high flat mountain tops and have slopes ranging from 3 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 34 to 38 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature ranges from 40 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are noncalcareous throughout.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section has 18 to 27 percent clay, 20 to 45 percent silt and 40 to 65 percent sand.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 15 percent in the A and B horizons and 10 to 25 percent in the C horizon.  They are less than 3 inches in diameter and dominantly less than 1 inch in diameter.  The soil ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid in the subsurface layers.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bw horizon has color and texture similar to the A horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4."
