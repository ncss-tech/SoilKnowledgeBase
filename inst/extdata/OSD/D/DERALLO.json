  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Derallo soils are on hills and mountains. They typically occur on backslope positions. These soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as rhyolite, rhyodacite, and obsidian. Slopes are 15 to 60 percent. Elevations range from 1,355 to 1,925 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 58 cm (A1, A2, AB, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 30 to 104 cm (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons).\nVitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 76 cm (A1, A2, AB, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons and part of the Bt3 horizon).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 104 cm to underlying weathered bedrock (Cr layer).\nParticle-size control section and ashy-skeletal substitute class with glassy mineralogy - The zone from 30 to 82 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons and part of the Bt3 horizon).\nA revision in January 2003 moved the type location to a more representative area within Lake County and revised the series concept.\nADDITIONAL DATA: The typical pedon at the series type location is reference sampled for the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S02OR-037-003 (pedon # 03N0330). Selected data including optical glass counts are available. Volcanic glass content has also been determined locally in the Reno MO by optical grain counts using a polarizing petrographic microscope.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
