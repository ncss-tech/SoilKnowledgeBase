Dalig soils formed in loess mixed with colluvium and residuum derived from basalt. Summers are warm and dry, winters are cool and moist with snow cover from December through April. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 35 inches. The average January temperature is 27 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 65 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
