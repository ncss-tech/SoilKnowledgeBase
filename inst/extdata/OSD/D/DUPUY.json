The Cg horizon ranges from very strongly acid to neutral. The calcium/magnesium ratio is more than 1.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3; in some pedons where the A horizon is less than 6 inches thick, it has hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2. It is very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe AB or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2. Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of gray or brown. Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6 in more than 50 percent of the matrix. Iron accumulations and depletions in shades of gray and brown range from common to many. Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2.  In the lower parts it may also have hue of 10YR, value 6 and chroma 1 and 2; and value 4 and 5 and chroma of 1. Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of gray and brown. Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, loam, or silt loam. The upper 20 inches has from 18 to 34 percent clay, and more than 15 percent sand that is mainly in the very-fine size fraction.\nThe BCg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, or hue of 2.5Y to 10Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Galvez, Loreauville and Patoutville soils are in closely related families. Galvez soils have higher pH in the upper part of the solum and are superactive. Loreauville soils have a surface layer that meets all criteria for a mollic epipedon except that it is 6 to 10 inches thick and have higher pH throughout the solum. Patoutville soils have red iron accumulations in the subsoil, have episaturation, and formed in loess."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dupuy soils are on nearly level to gently sloping natural levee positions along former channels of the Mississippi River and its distributaries on the Teche Delta Complex, in the Southern Mississippi Valley Alluvium Major Land Resource Area (MLRA 131). Typically, they are on older bayous that were cross-cut by the present day Bayou Teche. Slope gradients are typically less than 2 percent. The soil formed in silty alluvium. Elevation ranges from 5 to 10 feet above mean sea level.  Mean annual air temperature is 68 degrees F. near the type location, and mean annual rainfall is about 65 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the closely related Galvez and Loreauville soils, and the Baldwin, Cancienne, Iberia, Schriever, and Thibaut soils. Baldwin soils are on lower positions on the natural levee and are clayey throughout the upper part of the solum. Iberia, Schriever, and Thibaut soils are on the lowest parts of the natural levee or in backswamp positions and are clayey throughout the upper part of the solum. Cancienne soils formed in nonacid sediments deposited on younger delta systems and do not have an argillic horizon."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Dupuy soils are somewhat poorly drained. Runoff is negligible to medium depending on slope. Permeability is moderately slow. The soil is wet in all layers below about 1.5 to 3.5 feet during the winter and spring months in normal years. Flooding is common in areas not protected by levees and generally occurs during June through November in normal years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas that are protected from flooding are cleared and used for growing sugarcane, soybeans, sorghum, small grain, hay, and pasture. Unprotected areas are in bottom land hardwoods. Important trees are cherrybark oak, pecan, eastern cottonwood, sweetgum, and water oak."

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the type location pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 10 inches (A and AB horizons).\nArgillic horizon - 10 to 42 inches (Bt and Btg horizons).\nAquic conditions - saturation, reduction and redoximorphic features within the upper 5 inches of the Bt horizon (10 to 15 inches deep).\nADDITIONAL DATA: pH data for the type location pedon were run by LSU.  The type location pedon was sampled for full characterization by NSSL in 2002 (S02-LA101-002).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
