Slopes are 0 to 75 percent.  Devore soils formed in residuum and colluvium from gneiss, schist, and granodiorite with a mantle of volcanic ash.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 25 to 50 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 21 degrees F, the average July temperature is about 58 degrees F, and the average annual air temperature is 35 to 41 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees is 60 to 110 days."
