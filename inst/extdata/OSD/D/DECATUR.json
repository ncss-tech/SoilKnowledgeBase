  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 72 inches. The upper 50 inches of the soil contains less than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the 20 to 200 micron size.  The solum ranges from medium to very strongly acid.  Any horizon may contain up to 10 percent fragments of chert and quartzite pebbles 2 mm to 3 inches in size and up to 3 percent fragments over 3 inches. Dark brown to black concretions range from few to many in each horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. Severely eroded pedons have Ap horizons of silty clay or clay.\nSome pedons have BA or AB horizons less than 6 inches thick with the same hue, value, chroma, and texture range as the A horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 10R, value of 3, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Color value of the dry soil is less than 1 unit higher than that of the moist soil.  Texture in the upper 20 inches is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay that contains 35 to 60 percent clay and less than 20 percent sand.  The lower part of the Bt horizon commonly contains 45 to 60 percent clay; however, the range includes clay loam below a depth of 60 inches.  Structure grade is usually moderate but ranges from weak to strong, subangular blocky to blocky.  In some pedons cherty limestone bedrock is at depths of greater than 6 feet."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Anniston and Beckham series in the same family, and the Davidson, Greenville, Gwinnett and Lloyd series in closely related families.  Anniston, Beckham and Greenville soils have more sand in the control section.  Davidson soils have less clay in the lower Bt horizon. Gwinnett soils have sola less than 40 inches thick and are deep to paralithic contact. Lloyd soils formed in residuum from mafic igneous or high-grade metamorphic rocks and have few to common mica flakes. Additionally, Davidson, Greenville, Gwinnett and Lloyd soils have kandic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Slope ranges from 1 to 25 percent, but is more commonly 1 to 10 percent.  The soil formed in old valley fill material and residuum weathered from limestone.  Limestone bedrock is at depths greater than 6 feet.  The climate is warm and humid. Near the type location the average daily temperature is 44 degrees F., for January, and 75 degrees F., for July, the mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F.  The average freeze-free season is 225 days.  The mean annual precipitation is more than 49 inches."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The 5/99 revision updates particle size class to fine. Competing series were also updated. Laboratory data indicates that kandic horizons commonly occur in areas mapped as Decatur and a separate series may need to be developed for these situations. The Geographic Setting section allows old alluvium for parent material, but this is not considered the main concept for this soil.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 7 inches (A horizon).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from a depth of 7 inches to a depth of at least 120 inches (Bt horizons).\nPaleudults great group - do not have a decrease in clay of 20 percent of the maximum within 60 inches of the surface.\nRhodic subgroup - have within the upper 30 inches of the argillic horizon a hue of 2.5YR or redder, moist value of 3 or less, and dry value no more than 1 unit higher than moist value.\nMLRAs: 122, 128\nRevised: 12/88-CDB,GWH; 5/99-RLL,DHK\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
