  "OVERVIEW": "The Dragnot series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on canyons.  They formed in colluvium from granodiorite.  Permeability is moderate.  Slope ranges from 40 to 70 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 23 inches.",
