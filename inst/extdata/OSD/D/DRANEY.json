  "BYREV": "Rev. BJD-FRK-RJS",
  "REVDATE": "07/2008",
  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Draney series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in a thin mantle of alluvium over weakly consolidated tuffaceous calcareous siltstone or sandstone or weakly consolidated calcareous ash.  These soils are on convex shoulder positions on hills.  Permeability is moderately rapid. Slopes are 15 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
