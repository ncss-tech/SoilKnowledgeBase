  "OVERVIEW": "The Delplain series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum or colluvium derived from hard shale and sandstone.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, dipslopes and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
