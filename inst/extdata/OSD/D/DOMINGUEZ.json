  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 58 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 78 degrees F.  Thickness of sola ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  The weighted average content of organic carbon in the upper 15 inches is approximately .7 percent.  The sand/clay ratio is less than 1.  Cation exchange capacity ranges from 60 to 90 milliequivalents per 100 grams of clay.  The particle-size control section is typically clay or clay loam, and clay ranges from 35 to 50 percent, silt from 15 to 40 percent, and sand from 15 to 45 percent, with more than 15 percent but less than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent, but are commonly less than 5 percent.  These soils are usually moist in some part between depths of 4 and 12 inches for more than 1/4 but less than 1/2 of the time the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F.  and are usually moist in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for less than 60 cumulative days during the 120 days following the winter solstice.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  When the surface horizon value is as dark as 5 dry and 3 moist, the horizon is too thin or has too little organic matter to qualify as a mollic epipedon.  This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to 8.6).  Typically, it has fine granular primary structure but has subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  It is slightly hard or soft.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Typically, the horizon has coarse prismatic primary structure that parts to angular blocky, but the prismatic structure is weak in some pedons.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to 8.6).  This horizon has redder hue or brighter chroma than the overlying and underlying horizons or it has moderate grade of structure overlying a continuous horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has 4 to about 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bumbob(T), Denby, Heldt, Littlenan, and Lockerby series.  Bumbob soils have hue yellower than 7.5YR. Denby soils have SAR values of 9 to 24 and hues of 7.5YR and yellower in the subsurface horizons.  Heldt soils have hue of 5Y through 10YR in the cambic horizon.  Littlenan and Lockerby soils have a paralithic contact above 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dominguez soils are on alluvial fans, toe slopes, and valley side slopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  The soil formed in fine-textured, calcareous, alluvial fan sediments weathered from reddish brown calcareous shales of the Morrison formation.  Elevation ranges from 5,000 to 6,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 15 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 52 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature ranges from 62 to 75 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 100 to 150 days."
