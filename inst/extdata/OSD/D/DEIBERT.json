  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 20 to 45 inches.  Clay content of the argillic horizon averages 20 to 35 percent.  Gravel content ranges from 1 to 10 percent in the loamy material and 3 to 27 percent in the sandy substratum.  Cobble content ranges from 0 to 3 percent throughout the profile.\nThe upper part of the control section (A horizon) has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is dominantly sandy loam but range includes fine sandy loam or loam.  Reaction of the A horizon ranges from moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe second part of the control section (E horizon) has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  The E horizon can have fragipan like characteristics of being hard and brittle when dry.  Reaction of the E horizon ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe third part of the control section (B\\E, Bt horizons) has hue of 7.5 YR or 5YR, value and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam.  The E part has colors and textures similar to the E horizon.  Reaction of the B\\E horizon ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe fourth part of the control section (C horizon) has hue of 7.5YR, and 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam or silt loam.  Reaction of the C horizon ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nThe fifth part of the control section (2E' and Bt horizons) has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sand.  The Bt part of the 2E' and Bt horizon occurs as lamellae 1/4 to 3 inches thick.  It has hue of 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loamy sand or sandy loam.\nThe lower part of the control section (3C horizon) has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is stratified sand and gravel or gravelly sand."
