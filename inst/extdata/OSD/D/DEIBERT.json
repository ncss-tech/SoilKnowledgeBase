  "REVDATE": "08/2012",
  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Deibert series consists of very deep, well drained, soils that formed in loamy over sandy glacial drift on kame moraines, end moraines and kames.  Permeability is slow in the loamy material and rapid in the sandy material.  Slope ranges from 12 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 20 to 45 inches.  Clay content of the argillic horizon averages 20 to 35 percent.  Gravel content ranges from 1 to 10 percent in the loamy material and 3 to 27 percent in the sandy substratum.  Cobble content ranges from 0 to 3 percent throughout the profile.\nThe upper part of the control section (A horizon) has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is dominantly sandy loam but range includes fine sandy loam or loam.  Reaction of the A horizon ranges from moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe second part of the control section (E horizon) has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  The E horizon can have fragipan like characteristics of being hard and brittle when dry.  Reaction of the E horizon ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe third part of the control section (B\\E, Bt horizons) has hue of 7.5 YR or 5YR, value and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam.  The E part has colors and textures similar to the E horizon.  Reaction of the B\\E horizon ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe fourth part of the control section (C horizon) has hue of 7.5YR, and 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam or silt loam.  Reaction of the C horizon ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nThe fifth part of the control section (2E' and Bt horizons) has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sand.  The Bt part of the 2E' and Bt horizon occurs as lamellae 1/4 to 3 inches thick.  It has hue of 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loamy sand or sandy loam.\nThe lower part of the control section (3C horizon) has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is stratified sand and gravel or gravelly sand."
