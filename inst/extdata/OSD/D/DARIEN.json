Some pedons have an A horizon, 1 to 4 inches thick, that has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate granular or weak subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable or friable. Rock fragments range from 2 to 35 percent, and include up to 5 percent greater than 3 inches in diameter. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam. Structure is subangular blocky or platy. Consistence is friable or firm. Some pedons have an E horizon with chroma of 3 or 4. Rock fragments range from 2 to 35 percent, and include up to 5 percent greater than 3 inches in diameter. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Btg or Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is clay loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction, with subhorizons of silt loam. Structure is subangular blocky, angular blocky, or prismatic parting to blocky. Consistence is friable, firm or very firm. Rock fragments range from 2 to 35 percent, and include up to 5 percent greater than 3 inches in diameter. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is clay loam or silty clay loam, with subhorizons of silt loam. Primary structure of subangular blocky, angular blocky, platy, or prismatic is inherited from the parent material. Carbonates are present in most pedons. Rock fragments range from 2 to 35 percent, and include up to 5 percent greater than 3 inches in diameter. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Consistence is firm or very firm. Rock fragments range from 10 to 60 percent, and include 5 to 10 percent greater than 3 inches in diameter. In some pedons, rock fragments are absent below 40 inches. Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline. Some pedons lack carbonates in the upper part of the C horizon."

Angola, Mitiwanga, and Shadeland soils have bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches. Appleton soils average less than 28 percent clay in the particle size control section. Ayrshire soils have rock fragment contents less than 1 percent in the lower part of the series control section. Burdett, Digby, Jimtown, Sleeth soils have have lithologigic discontinuities within the series control section. Crawleyville soils have a reaction that is more acid than neutral in the lower part of the series control section. Mongle soils do not have a calcareous substratum. Ovid soils have hue redder than 10YR in the subsoil and substratum. Whitaker soils are stratified in the series control section."

The moderately well drained Danley soils on higher convex ridges and the poorly drained Ilion soils in low areas and depressions are in a drainage sequence with Darien soil. Appleton soils have lower clay content in the subsoil and are on similar landscape positions. The moderately well drained Hudson soils are on nearby lake plains. The well drained Lansing soils and the moderately well drained Langford and Nunda soils are on higher landscape positions. Remsen soils have higher clay content in the subsoil and are on similar landscape positions."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The bedrock substratum phase mapped in Geauga County, Ohio, has interbedded shale and siltstone bedrock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. This phase does not meet current criteria for substratum phases, and will be evaluated as a potential new series during future MLRA update activities. This revision reflects changes in classification and terminology to current standards and specifications of the 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. The cation-exchange activity class is assigned as 'active' in this OSD revision of Darien.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 11 inches (Ap and Bg horizons).\nArgillic horizon - from a depth of 11 to 32 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nAquic conditions - from a depth of 8 to 72 inches.\nUdic moisture regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
