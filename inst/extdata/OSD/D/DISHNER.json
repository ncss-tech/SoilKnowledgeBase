The soil formed in residuum from sandstone and conglomerate with a slight influence from loess.  It may occur as depression areas between mounds of deeper soils.  The elevation ranges from 2,200 to 4,000 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 11 to 14 inches and includes 2 to 4 feet of snowfall.  Average annual air temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free season is 120 to 145 days."
