  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Daybrook soils are on linear or convex slopes of till plains and moraines. They formed in 20 to 40 inches of glacial outwash  and the underlying dense, loamy glacial till. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. The mean annual air temperature is 38 to 40 degrees F., mean annual precipitation 26 to 28 inches and the frost-free period is 95 to 125 days. Elevation above sea level is 1280 to 1610 feet."

Well drained Greatscott, moderately well drained Nashwauk, somewhat poorly drained Keewatin and poorly and very poorly drained Balkan soils do not have a mantle of outwash. The somewhat poorly drained Shenango soils are on lower lying linear to concave slopes. Somewhat excessively drained Graycalm and excessively drained Menahga soils formed in deep sandy outwash."
