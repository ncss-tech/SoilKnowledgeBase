    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches thick.  The combined thickness of the A1, B1 and B2t horizons is 60 inches or more.  The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature ranges from 59 to 68 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist, but are dry for 50 to 85 consecutive days during the summer.  Rock fragments are rounded sandstone and quartzite pebbles, cobbles and stones, and range from 20 to 65 percent in the A1 horizon, 40 to 85 percent in the B1 horizon, and 55 to 70 percent in the B2t horizon.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 and 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry, and 2 or 3 moist.  It ranges from stony loam on the surface to gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly or very cobbly loam, cobbly clay loam, or very cobbly sandy clay loam in the lower part.  This horizon ranges from slightly acid to neutral and is 8 to 18 inches thick.\nThe B1 horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry, and 2 through 6 moist.  It ranges from very gravelly heavy loam to gravelly, cobbly, very gravelly or very cobbly clay loam,.  Clay films range from none to common thin.  This horizon is medium acid to neutral, and is 0 to 9 inches thick.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 3 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 8 dry, and 3 through 8 moist.  It ranges from gravelly, very gravelly cobbly or very cobbly clay to very gravelly or very cobbly sandy clay, very cobbly silty clay, or very cobbly heavy clay loam, and has 35 to 60 percent clay.  The clay content does not decrease by as much as 20 percent of the maximum with 60 inches of the surface.  Structure ranges from moderate medium and coarse prismatic to moderate to strong, fine to coarse, angular and subangular blocky.  Clay films range from common to continuous, thin to moderately thick.  The reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral."

Slopes range from 30 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in residuum, colluvium, and local alluvium, weathered from sandstone and quartzite.  The climate is moist subhumid, with and average annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 25 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 58 to 64 degrees F.   The frost free season ranges from 60 to 100 days."

Smarts soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick and base saturation of less than 75 percent in some part or throughout the upper 30 inches of the soil."
