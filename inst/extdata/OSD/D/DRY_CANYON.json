  "OVERVIEW": "The Dry Canyon series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum from red sandstone, red siltstone or conglomerate derived from these sources. Dry Canyon soils are on mountain backslopes and alluvial fans. Slopes are 5 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
