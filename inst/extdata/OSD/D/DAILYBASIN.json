  "OVERVIEW": "The Dailybasin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, or till from sedimentary and igneous rock sources. Dailybasin soils are on mountain slopes, foothills, moraines, landslides, alluvial fans, outwash fans, and stream terraces. Permeability is moderate. Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
