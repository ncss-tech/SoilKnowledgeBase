  "OVERVIEW": "The Dosamigos series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils.  They have formed in mixed alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rock.  Dosamigos soils are on low alluvial fans adjacent to basin rims in the valley and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

These soils are being differentiated by a very slow permeability and a clayey control section.  pH determined by colorimetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Truog Triplex indicators.  Texture determined by hydrometer method.  Soluble salts and exchangeable sodium determined by saturation and extract.  Organic matter determined by Walkley-Black digestion method.  Presence of carbonates determined by 10 percent HC1 solution.\nRunoff terminology updated 4/96 from slow to new criteria, and comply with the Soil Survey Manual, 10/93.\nLast revised by the state on 7/96.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL pedon S91CA-099-008 (partial pedon)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
