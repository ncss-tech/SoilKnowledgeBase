Chateau soils have an ochric epipedon and more than 15 exchangeable sodium percent in the A horizon.  Deldota soils have wide cracks to a depth of 20 inches when dry.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dosamigos soils are on low alluvial fans adjacent to the valley basin rim.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in alluvium derived mostly from sedimentary rock.  Most of this soil has been leveled but was hummocky in its natural microrelief.  Elevations are 70 to 180 feet.  The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 to 12 inches.  Mean January temperature is 46 degrees F; mean July temperature is 79 degrees F.  The mean temperature is about 60 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 210 to 280 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included with and mapped as Lethent and Orestimba series in the Los Banos Area, series 1939 report.  These soils are being differentiated by a very slow permeability and a clayey control section.  pH determined by colorimetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Truog Triplex indicators.  Texture determined by hydrometer method.  Soluble salts and exchangeable sodium determined by saturation and extract.  Organic matter determined by Walkley-Black digestion method.  Presence of carbonates determined by 10 percent HC1 solution.\nRunoff terminology updated 4/96 from slow to new criteria, and comply with the Soil Survey Manual, 10/93.\nLast revised by the state on 7/96.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL pedon S91CA-099-008 (partial pedon)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
