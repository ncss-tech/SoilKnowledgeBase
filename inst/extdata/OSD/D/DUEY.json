    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to highly fractured limestone ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  Depth to hard consolidated limestone bedrock ranges from 12 to 55 inches.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline in the Ap and A horizons and from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline in the AC and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Content of rock fragments range from 10 to 60 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe AC horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Content of rock fragments range from 15 to 40 percent, by volume.  Texture is loam, clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Content of rock fragments range from 5 to 50 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of highly fractured limestone.  It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools, and is rippable by mechanized equipment.\nThe R layer is composed of hard consolidated limestone bedrock."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Duey soils are on ridge tops, summits and side slopes in limestone hills of the Semiarid Mountains and Valleys MLRA of southern Puerto Rico.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent.  They formed in material that weathered from limestone bedrock from the Cretaceous period.  The climate is tropical semiarid.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 55 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 75 to 79 degrees F."

Pozo Blanco soils do not have a lithic contact within the upper 80 inches.  San German soils are on similar positions, but the depth of the hard unweathered limestone bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches and are in the clayey-skeletal family."
