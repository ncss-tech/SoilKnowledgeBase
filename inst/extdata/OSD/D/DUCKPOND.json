  "OVERVIEW": "The Duckpond series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Holocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping floodplains in the Southern High Plains, Breaks (MLRA 77E).  The slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm (21 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",
