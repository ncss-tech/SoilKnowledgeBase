  "OVERVIEW": "The Dwarf series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on side slopes and ridges of mountains.  They formed in organic accumulations and residuum from metamorphosed andesitic to basaltic, marine deposited volcanic sandstone rocks that has been effected by soil creep.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 250 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.",
