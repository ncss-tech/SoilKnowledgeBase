    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Soils are moist in winter and spring.  They are warmer than 41 degrees F.\nf.om April 1 to November 1, and they are dry within this period after July 1.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to the duripan ranges from 13 to 20 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The solum is neutral in the upper part and neutral through moderately alkaline in the lower part.  The depth to the Bt horizon is 10 to 17 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist.  The A horizon has 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  This horizon is 40 to 55 percent clay and 0 to 35 percent gravel.  The Bt has prismatic or columnar structure.  A thin E horizon and BA horizon is present in some pedons.  The duripan is calcareous in some pedons."

The soils formed in material weathered from lava rocks and pumiceous ash.  The climate is characterized by cold moist winters and warm dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 11 to 13 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F., mean January temperature is 27 to 29 degrees F., and mean July temperature is 59 to 61 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
