  "OVERVIEW": "The Decantel series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from lava rocks and ash.  Decantel soils are on lava plains and benches and have slopes of 1 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to the duripan ranges from 13 to 20 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The solum is neutral in the upper part and neutral through moderately alkaline in the lower part.  The depth to the Bt horizon is 10 to 17 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist.  The A horizon has 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  This horizon is 40 to 55 percent clay and 0 to 35 percent gravel.  The Bt has prismatic or columnar structure.  A thin E horizon and BA horizon is present in some pedons.  The duripan is calcareous in some pedons."
