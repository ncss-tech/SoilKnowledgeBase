    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Desertmann soils are on fan remnants.  They typically occur on summit positions.  They formed in alluvium derived from metamorphic and volcanic rock with granitic influence. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,524 to 1,829 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
