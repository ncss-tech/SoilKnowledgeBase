  "OVERVIEW": "The Desertmann series consists of moderately deep,to a duripan well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic and metamorphic rock with granitic influence. Desertmann soils are on fan remnants and fan piedmonts. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
