    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Downey soils are on level to gently sloping terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 4,600 to 4,900 feet.  The soils formed in silty alluvium overlying alluvial gravel and sand of mixed mineralogy.  The climate is semiarid with dry summers and annual precipitation of 12 to 16 inches.  The average annual temperature is about 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 80 to 100 days."

Arbone, Hondoho, and Ririe soils lack contrasting textures in the control section.  In addition, Hondoho soils are loamy-skeletal and Ririe soils are coarse-silty.  Arbone and Hondoho soils are on drainage slopes and terraces breaks.  Arimo (T) soils are on the same landscape position as Downey soils, but where the deposits overlying sand and gravel are thicker.  Ririe soils are on loess mantled terraces and foothills."
