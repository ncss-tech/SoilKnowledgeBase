Karta soils have a Cr horizon of dense flacial till at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Hinker, Humskel, and Thader soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Saar and Shuksan soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact with dense compact, glacial till.

The soils formed in unconsolidated glacial till, and colluvium and slope alluvium from sandstone, conglomerate, volcanic, and metasedimentary rocks, with an admixture of volcanic ash.  Deming soils are in a cold marine climate with cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Snow cover lasts from November through May.  Average annual precipitation is 80 to 95 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F. and mean July temperature is about 56 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 80 to 95 days."
