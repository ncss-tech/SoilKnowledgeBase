  "OVERVIEW": "The Deming series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash, unconsolidated glacial till, and colluvium from sandstone, conglomerate, metasedimentary, and volcanic rocks.  Deming soils are on glacially modified mountain backslopes.  Slopes of 5 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 90 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
