  "OVERVIEW": "The Deertrail series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in eolian or alluvial material.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on upland tablelands or intermediate areas between uplands and lower run-on areas.  Slopes range from 0 to about 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
