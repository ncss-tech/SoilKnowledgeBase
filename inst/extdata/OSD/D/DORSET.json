  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 14 to 45 inches.  The mollic epipedon thickness ranges from 7 to 15 inches. Depth to loamy sand or coarser texture ranges from 12 to 24 inches.  The loamy sediments contain up to 10 percent rock fragments by volume.  The underlying sediments generally contain 15 to 35 percent rock fragments by volume with subhorizons up to 50 percent.  The rock fragments are of mixed lithology and mostly less than 5 cm in diameter. The soil moisture control section is moist in some or all parts throughout the year in 6 or more years out of 10. The particle-size control section averages less than 18 percent clay.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  Reaction is neutral to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have an AB horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, coarse sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a 2Bt horizon of sand, coarse sand, gravelly loamy sand or gravelly loamy coarse sand.  Some pedons have gravelly sand, or gravelly coarse sand with lamellae or thin finer textured bands in the lower part.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a 2BC horizon.\nThe 2Bk and 2C horizon have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is very gravelly coarse sand, gravelly coarse sand, gravelly loamy sand, gravelly sand, coarse sand or sand.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and the undersides of most pebbles have carbonate accumulations."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Dorset soils are on plane or convex slopes on outwash plains, valley trains, stream terraces and moraines.  Slope gradient ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  They formed in a thin loamy mantle and in underlying sandy and gravelly outwash of Late Wisconsinan age.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 26 inches.  Frost free days range from 90 to 170.  Elevations above sea level range from 700 to 2000 feet."
