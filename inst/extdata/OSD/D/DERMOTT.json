  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Dermott series was formerly included in the Potter series. The series was separated based on the petrocalcic horizon, mineralogy and moisture regime.\nEdited 11/2015 (RFG-ROG): Changed to tabular format. Added metric measurements. Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 in). (A1 and A2 horizons)\nPetrocalcic horizon: 30 to 104 cm (12 to 41 in). (Bkm and Bkm/Bk horizons)\nCalcic horizon: 104 to 211 cm (41 to 83 in). (Bk horizons)\nAdditional Comments:\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by National Soil Survey Laboratory data number S03-TX-415-004 from Scurry County, Texas.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL Data from type location S03-TX-415-004. Particle-size analysis, silicate clay analysis, calcium carbonate equivalent, and pH were performed at the project office on 5 pedons. The array of colors, horizon depths, and percentages of carbonates and fragments from 15 described pedons.\nTaxonomic version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Ninth Edition, 2003\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
