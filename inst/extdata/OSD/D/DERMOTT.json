  "OVERVIEW": "The Dermott series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to a fractured and weathered petrocalcic horizon. They are well drained and moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum derived from the Ogallala Formation. These soils are on gently to steeply sloping hills and ridges. Slope ranges from 3 to 30 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches.",
