  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is less than 32 degrees F.  The mat of organic material consists of fibrous moss over partially decomposed moss, twigs, and root material 8 to 12 inches thick.  Depth to permafrost is highly variable within short distances and ranges from 18 to 35 inches below the mineral soil surface 2 months after the summer solstice.  Texture of the control section is sand with 45 to 70 percent coarse fragments.  The mineral soil is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; moist value of 2, 3, or 4; and moist chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is commonly mucky silt loam, silt loam, or silt.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent and includes well rounded gravel and cobble.  This horizon is extremely thin in many profiles.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; moist value of 4 or 5; and moist chroma of 2, 3 or 4.  Texture is sand or loamy sand with 5 to 25 percent cobble and 40 to 65 percent gravel.  In the Cf horizon, ice occurs in macropores between sand grains and coarse fragments. Massive ice wedges are present in a few pedons."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dadina soils are formed in a thick organic mat over very gravelly alluvium on high stream terraces or over localized glacial outwash on broad lacustrine terraces and glacial till plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent and are typically plane to concave.\nThe climate is subarctic continental with long, cold winters and short, warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 17 inches and the mean annual snowfall ranges from 39 to 68 inches.  Mean January temperature is minus 10 degrees F., mean July temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature ranges from 23 to 27 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Klanelneechena, Klawasi, Pippin, and Tolsona soils.  Klanelneechena soils are in similar positions and have sandy control sections.  Klawasi soils are on lacustrine terraces and have a thin loess mantle over a clayey substratum.  Pippin soils are well drained and do not have permafrost or a histic epipedon.  Tolsona soils are on glacial till plains and have loamy control sections."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly or poorly drained.  Runoff is very slow.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the organic mat, moderate in the loess mantle, and very rapid in the mineral horizons.  Altered drainage occurs where the insulating organic mat is destroyed by fire or clearing.  Loss of the organic mat results in lowering of the permafrost ost level with subsequent lowering of the water table.  Texture and permeability of the thawed substratum is similar to that of the overlying layers."
