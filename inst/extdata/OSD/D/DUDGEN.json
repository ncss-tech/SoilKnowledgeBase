The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F.\nf.om mid February to late December and exceeds 47 degrees F. from mid April to early December.  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from early July to early October and is moist in all parts from early November to early June.  The particle size control section averages 40 to 60 percent clay.  Organic carbon ranges from 0.55 to 0.40 percent to a depth of 4 to 10 inches and decreases regularly with depth.   Base saturation ranges from 90 to 100 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 7/1 or 7/3.  Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3; 7.5YR 4/2, or 4/4.  The clay content is 20 to 27 percent.\nThe Bt horizon color is 10YR 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 7/1; 7.5YR 5/4 or 6/6. Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4; 7.5YR 4/2 or 4/4.  It is clay loam in the upper part with 27 to 35 percent clay and clay in the lower part with 40 to 60 percent clay.  The Bt horizon averages greater than 40 percent clay.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe 2Bqm horizon has 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick continuous silica capping underlain by 2 to 12 inches of extremely firm or very firm coarse alluvium that is slightly or moderately brittle with platy structure or is massive.\nThe 2Bq and 2C horizons are stratified loamy sand to silt loam.
