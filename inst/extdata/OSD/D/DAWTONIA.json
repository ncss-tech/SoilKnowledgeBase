  "OVERVIEW": "The Dawtonia series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium.  Dawtonia soils are on mountains, foothills and fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 50 percent. Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
