The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 50 degrees to 53 degrees F.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  This horizon is stratified unless stratifications have been destroyed by tilling.\nThe C horizon has lithochromic hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Above 40 inches, it is mostly stratified very fine sandy loam, and silt loam with thin strata of fine sandy loam or silty clay loam.  Below 40 inches, it is coarsely stratified silt loam to coarse sand with from 0 to 15 percent pebbles.  It is slightly acid or neutral."

The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 17 to 25 inches.  Average January temperature is 38 degrees F., average July temperature is 60 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 170 to 200 days."
