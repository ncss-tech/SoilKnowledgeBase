It is on a lake plain.\nA firm till substratum phase with a moist bulk density range of 1.65 to 1.75 g/cc is recognized in MLRA 103 on the Coteau Slope (bench) physiographic area\nCation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, twelfth edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
