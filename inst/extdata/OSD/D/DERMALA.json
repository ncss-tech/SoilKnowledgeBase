  "OVERVIEW": "The Dermala series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvial and colluvial sediments derived from mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks. Dermala soils are on hills and ridges and have slopes of 20 to 50 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches.",
