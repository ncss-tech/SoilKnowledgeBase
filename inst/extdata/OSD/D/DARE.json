  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the organic deposit ranges from 51 inches to more than 96 inches. The soil is ultra acid or extremely acid in the organic layers, except where the surface has been limed, and extremely acid to moderately acid in the mineral layers.\nThe organic material is paste-like and has a slick feel when saturated, and is massive when moist. Upon aeration and drainage, the organic material forms weak subangular blocky structure. When this material becomes dry over a short period and does not rewet.\nStumps, logs, and roots from the original vegetation occupy up to 35 percent of the surface and subsurface volume. Content of charcoal ranges from common (2 to 20 percent) in the surface layer to few (0 to 2 percent) in the subsurface horizons.\nThe surface tier is black (N 2/, 5YR 2/1; 10YR 2/1) or very dark brown (10YR 2/2). Texture is muck or woody muck.\nThe subsurface tier is centered on dark reddish brown (2.5YR 2/4; 5YR 2/2, 3/2), dusky red (2.5YR 3/2), and very dusky red (2.5YR 2/2), and ranges to very dark brown (10YR 2/2), very dark gray (5YR 3/1), and black (5YR 2/1; 10YR 2/1). Ten inches or more of the subsurface tier is in hue of 5YR to 2.5YR. Texture is muck or woody muck.\nThe Cg horizon is gray or dark gray or very dark brown to light brownish gray. Texture is loamy sand, fine sand, or sand and may be stratified."

Allemands, Belhaven, Delway, Pamlico, Ponzer, and Tomoka soils have less than 51 inches of organic material over mineral horizons. In addition Belhaven, Delway, Ponzer, and Tomoka soils have loamy mineral horizons and Allemands soils have a clayey mineral horizon beneath the organic material. Dorovan soils are on flood plains and have organic materials in hues of 10YR and 2.5Y. Longshoal and Maurepas soils are euic. Okeechobee and Pungo soils are hemic in part of the control section. Also, Pungo soils have a clayey mineral horizon beneath the organic material. Terra Ceia and Okeechobee soils are euic and have temperature regimes that are hyperthermic."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dare soils are on nearly level to level areas of the lower Coastal Plain. They formed under very poorly drained conditions from the remains of swampy vegetation dominated by tupelo, cypress, Atlantic white-cedar, and related non-woody, fiberous hydrophytic plants over sandy marine sediments. The mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 51 inches near the type location. The growing season is about 190 days."

All of these are mineral soils. Ballahack, Bayboro, Cape Fear, Hyde, Portsmouth, and Weeksville soils have umbric epipedons, and Wasda soils have a histic epipedon. Barclay and Pasquotank soils are better drained and are located higher on the landscape."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the acreage is undeveloped and support plant communities that reflect past history of treatment. Some areas are vegetated with scattered pond pine (Pinus serotina) and a dense undergrowth of both large and small gallberry (Ilex spp.) and huckleberry (Gaylvssacia spp.), greenbrier (Smilax spp.), wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), scattered red maple (Acer rubrum), red bay (Persea borbonia), sweet bay (Magnolia Virginia), and reeds (Arundinaria tecta). Areas with a history or severe burning usually have a smaller population of these species and contain large amounts of broomsedge (Andropogon spp.) and other grasses. These soils also support mixed hardwood forests dominated by water and swamp tupelo (Nyssa spp.), Southern bald cypress (Taxodium distichum), Atlantic white cedar (Chamaecyparis thyodies (L.) B.S.P.), and other hydrophytic species. Developed areas are used primarily for growing corn, soybeans, small grain, and pasture."
