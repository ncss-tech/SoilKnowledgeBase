  "OVERVIEW": "The Duffymont series consists of very shallow or shallow, well to somewhat excessively drained soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone.  Duffymont soils are on plateaus, mesas, hills, and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
