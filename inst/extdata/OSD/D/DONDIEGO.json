  "OVERVIEW": "The Dondiego series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist.  Dondiego soils are on treads of high stream terraces, low stream terraces of valley floors, and toeslopes of valley sides.  Slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
