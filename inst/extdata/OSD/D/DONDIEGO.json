Bluewater soils have calcic horizons between 10 and 35 inches, seasonal high water tables between 30 and 51 inches, and redoximorphic features within 40 inches of the soil surface.  Estrada soils have rock fragments of  sandstone and shale.  Garrett soils have Bt horizons with hue of 5YR or redder.  Jarita soils have hard bedrock between 20 and 40 inches.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dondiego soils are on treads of high stream terraces and on low stream terraces of valley floors.  They formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss and schist.  Slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,100 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 15 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.   The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

Levante soils are sandy, do not have diagnostic horizons, and occur on narrow flood plains of arroyos.  Altazano soils are coarse-loamy, do not have diagnostic horizons, and occur on flood plains of valley floors.  Ohke soils are sandy, have thin mollic epipedons, and occur on adjacent portions of low stream terraces."
