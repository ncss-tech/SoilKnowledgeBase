    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bertelson, Eccles, Escalante, Fione, Palisade, Somsen, and Strevell series.  Bertleson, Eccles, and Escalante soils have dominantly moderately coarse textured control sections.  Eccles and Fione soils are moderately rapidly permeable and have cambic horizons.  Palisade soils lack coarse fragments and/or laminations in the substratum.  Somsen soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.   Strevell soils have a skeletal discontinuity at depths of 25 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Declo soils are on terraces, terrace sideslopes, and valley floors. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent, and are dominantly less than 4 percent.  They formed in alluvium or lacustrine material that has been reworked by wind and water.  Elevation ranges from 2,500 to 5,600 feet.  Some areas are locally influenced by loess or silty alluvium from loess.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 12 inches, including about 2 feet of snow.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 53 degrees F.  The frost free season is about 95 to 140 days."

Bahem and Portneuf soils have a coarse silty control section.  Darkbull and Paniogue soils have discontinuities to sand and gravel above 40 inches.  Fingal soils have a mollic epipedon and mottles due to wetness above a depth of 40 inches.  Owsel soils have an argillic horizon.  Portino, Banbury, and Trevino soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches and 10 to 20 inches respectively.  Portneuf soils have a layer that contains greater than 20 percent durinodes or have a layer that is firm and brittle within the control section.  Bahem, Darkbull, Escalante, Fingal, Paniogue, Portneuf, and Strevell soils are on terraces.  Portino and Trevino soils are on basalt plains."
