Clay content in the textural control section ranges from 40 to 60 percent.  Depth to redox concentrations is 10 to 15 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has an SAR of 75 to 120 and an EC of 8 to 16 mmhos/cm.\nThe B horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silty clay in the upper part and clay in the lower part.  It has an SAR of 45 to 80 and as EC of 16 to 32.  It has 0 to 4 percent gypsum.\nThe C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silty clay of clay with 40 to 55 percent clay.
