  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the loess or silty alluvium mantle and the depth to stratified coarser texture ranges from 40 to 80 inches.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Weighted average clay content of the argillic horizon is 18 to 27 percent.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the pedon, but ranges to neutral in the Ap and E horizons where the soil is limed. Iron accumulations are within 72 inches and are commonly within 40 inches.  Saturation occurs below 40 inches and within 72 inches at some time in most years.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Uncultivated pedons have A horizons 1 to 4 inches thick with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.\nDoritty soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons or both).  The E part is like the E horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.\nThe Bt horizon is like the Bt part described above.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 4 to 6.\nThe 2C horizon has similar color as the C horizon. It is stratified gravelly coarse sand to silt loam."

Campia, Dobie, Otterholt, and Wickware soils are not mottled and are not saturated with water.  In addition, Campia soils are stratified within 40 inches, Dobie soils have a paralithic contact of sandstone within 40 inches, and Otterholt soils have sandy loam till at 40 to 60 inches.  Crystal Lake soils are stratified within a depth of 40 inches.  Spencer soils have sandy loam till at a depth of 40 to 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Doritty soils are on toeslopes of hills and on stream terraces.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 12 percent.  Doritty soils formed in loess and/or silty alluvium over coarser stratified alluvium.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.   The frost free period ranges from about 120 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 800 to 1,950 feet."

The well drained Dobie soils are nearby on higher positions in the landscape where the loess mantle is thinner over glauconitic sandstone.  The moderately well drained Quarderer soils formed in silty alluvium in lower landscape positions in drainageways.  The well drained Wickware soils are in similar or higher landscape positions on steeper slopes."

Permeability is moderate in the silty alluvium and moderately rapid or rapid as an average in the coarser stratified alluvium.  This soil has a seasonal perched water table at a depth of 3.5 to 6 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period of October to June in 6 or more out of 10 years.  In some areas, the water table is above 40 inches but is present less than 1 month per year or less than 6 out of 10 years."

The type location in Barron County, Wisconsin was redescribed in April 2001 and stratified alluvium below 45 inches was added to the official series description.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - 0 to 12 inches (Ap, E); albic horizon - 9 to 12 inches (E); glossic horizon - 12 to 18 inches (B/E); argillic horizon - 12 to 38 inches (B/E, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3); other features - saturation within 72 inches at some time in most years..\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Soil Interpretation Record - WI0482\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
