  "OVERVIEW": "The Doritty series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess and/or silty alluvium over coarser stratified alluvium on toeslopes of hills and on stream terraces. Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the loess or silty alluvium mantle and the depth to stratified coarser texture ranges from 40 to 80 inches.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Weighted average clay content of the argillic horizon is 18 to 27 percent.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the pedon, but ranges to neutral in the Ap and E horizons where the soil is limed. Iron accumulations are within 72 inches and are commonly within 40 inches.  Saturation occurs below 40 inches and within 72 inches at some time in most years.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Uncultivated pedons have A horizons 1 to 4 inches thick with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.\nDoritty soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons or both).  The E part is like the E horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.\nThe Bt horizon is like the Bt part described above.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 4 to 6.\nThe 2C horizon has similar color as the C horizon. It is stratified gravelly coarse sand to silt loam."
