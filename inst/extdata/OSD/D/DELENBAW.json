  "OVERVIEW": "The Delenbaw series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium from volcanic rock.  Delenbaw soils are on mesas and mesa escarpments and have slopes of 3 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
