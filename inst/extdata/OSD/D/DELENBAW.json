These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived dominantly from basalt but include influences from other volcanic rocks.  Elevations range from 5800 to 6500 feet.  The mean annual air temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  The frost-free period is 135 to 150 days."
