  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from about 7 to 15 inches.  The carbonates typically are at the surface but some pedons in native grass are leached to 6 inches.  The calcic horizon includes the B horizon and the calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 30 percent. It contains up to 5 percent pebbles by volume.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Typically, it is loam, but is very fine sandy loam, clay loam, or silt loam in some pedons.  It is loamy fine sand where the soil is thinly mantled by sandy sediments.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is loam or clay loam, but is sandy loam in some pedons.  Some pedons have masses of gypsum.  It typically has few or common, faint or distinct redox features in the lower part.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, chroma of 1 to 4.  It typically is stratified loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, and clay loam.  Some pedons have fine sand below a depth of 40 inches or more.  It has common or many, distinct or prominent redox features.  Some pedons have few to common masses of gypsum.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons are strongly alkaline below a depth of 60 inches."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Antler, Gilby, Hamerly, Moritz and Tetonview series.   Antler soils have less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser in the upper third of the series control section.  Bilber soils have less than 18 percent clay in the upper third of the series control section.  Hamerly soils lack stratification in the lower third of the series control section.  Moritz soils formed on flood plains and have an irregular decrease in organic carbon in the lower half of of the series control section.  Tetonview soils have a O horizon and have a mean annual precipitation of 14 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Davison soils are nearly level to undulating on slightly convex rises associated with swales, depressed drainageways and depressions of glacial plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in stratified glacial meltwater deposits or glacial till.  The mean air annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 26 inches."

Bonilla, Clarno, Crossplain, Dimo, Hand, Tetonka, and Worthing soils do not have calcic horizons.  Clarno and Hand soils are on slightly higher convex parts of the landscape.  Bonilla soils are in swales.  Crossplain soils are in drainageways.  Tetonka and Worthing soils are in swales, depressed drainageways and depressions. They have argillic horizons and are wetter.  Dimo soils are in swales and have sand and gravel at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Ethan soils are on slightly higher parts of the landscape and are well drained."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Surface runoff is low.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderate or moderately slow in the underlying material.  Subsoil drainage is effected by the capillary rise of water from a seasonal water table of 1.5 to 2.5 feet which concentrates lime, gypsum, and other salts in the Bk horizons."

The change in classification was based on an MLRA correlation.  This soil may be an Aquic Calciustoll as it occurs in map unit HcB in Hutchinson County, SD.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
