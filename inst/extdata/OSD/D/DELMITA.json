About 20 percent is for dry-land crop production of cotton, grain sorghum, watermelon, and forage production. A few areas are irrigated and produce such crops as citrus, cotton, sorghums, and winter vegetables. Principal grasses of uncultivated areas include Arizona cottontop, lovegrass tridens, plains bristlegrass and pink pappusgrass. Woody vegetation includes mesquite, catclaw, lime pricklyash, desert yaupon, and pricklypear."

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from surrounding counties in the region.\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
