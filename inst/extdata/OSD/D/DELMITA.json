  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Delmita series consists of moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon, well drained, moderately permeable soils. These soils formed in non-calcareous loamy alluvium over calcareous loamy residuum and petrocalcics of the Goliad Formation. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils occur on broad, low ridges on inland, dissected coastal plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 584 mm (23 in).",

Principal grasses of uncultivated areas include Arizona cottontop, lovegrass tridens, plains bristlegrass and pink pappusgrass. Woody vegetation includes mesquite, catclaw, lime pricklyash, desert yaupon, and pricklypear."
