    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The solum has an estimated bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  Depth to the lithic contact is 10 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 50 to 70 percent rock fragments and 2 to 6 percent clay.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly ashy sandy loam or very gravelly ashy coarse sandy loam.  It has 35 to 50 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 4 to 6 moist.  It has 55 to 70 percent pebbles and 5 to 10 percent cobbles."

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from granite with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  Slopes are 15 to 40 percent.  Elevations range from 4,900 to 6,200 feet.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 35 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 18 to 22 degrees F., the average July temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F., and the average annual air temperature ranges from 35 to 40 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 60 to 90 days."

Myerscreek soils are very deep and form in compact glacial till with a mantle of volcanic ash.  Sitdown soils are very deep and form in ablation till or outwash with a mantle of volcanic ash."

A lithic contact at 17 inches and a sandy-skeletal particle-size control section.  Vitrandic properties from 1 to 9 inches.\nAll depths to diagnostic horizons and other features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
