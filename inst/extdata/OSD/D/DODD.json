  "OVERVIEW": "The Dodd series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from granitic rock with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  These soils are on shoulders and ridges of mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The solum has an estimated bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  Depth to the lithic contact is 10 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 50 to 70 percent rock fragments and 2 to 6 percent clay.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly ashy sandy loam or very gravelly ashy coarse sandy loam.  It has 35 to 50 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 4 to 6 moist.  It has 55 to 70 percent pebbles and 5 to 10 percent cobbles."

A lithic contact at 17 inches and a sandy-skeletal particle-size control section.  Vitrandic properties from 1 to 9 inches.\nAll depths to diagnostic horizons and other features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon."
