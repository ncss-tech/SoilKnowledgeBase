  "OVERVIEW": "The Dworshak series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and loess over residuum from metamorphic rock. Dworshak soils are on mountain slopes and have slopes of 5 to 50 percent. Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
