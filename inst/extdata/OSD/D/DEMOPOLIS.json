  "OVERVIEW": "The Demopolis series consists of shallow, well drained, very slowly permeable soils on ridge tops and side slopes in uplands of the Alabama and Mississippi Blackland Prairie (MLRA 135A) and the Cretaceous Western Coastal Plain (MLRA 135B) Major Land Resource Area. They formed in material that weathered from soft limestone. Near the type location, average annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 58 inches. Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the soil over level-bedded, chalk bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout the profile and the soil is strongly or violently effervescent. The fine-earth fraction of the soil contains from 18 to 35 percent clay. Chalk fragments are considered pararock fragments and are not used in determining the particle-size family.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Percent by volume of chalk fragments ranges from 5 to 35 percent. Content of nodules, concretions, and/or soft masses of calcium carbonate ranges from few to many. Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam; or their channery or cobbly analogues.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Redox accumulations in shades of brown and yellow range from none to common and are considered to be relic features.  Percent by volume of soft chalk fragments ranges from 5 to 35 percent. Content of nodules, concretions, and/or soft masses of calcium carbonate ranges from common to many. Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam; or their channery or cobbly analogues.\nThe Cr horizon is level-bedded chalk or soft limestone with platy rock structure.  It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools and is rippable by mechanized equipment."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Demopolis soils are on dissected uplands of the Alabama and Mississippi Blackland Prairie and the Cretaceous Coastal Plain. Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent. They formed in materials weathered from thick beds of soft limestone, primarily the Demopolis and Mooreville Chalks of the Selma Group. The climate is humid subtropical. The average annual air temperature ranges from 60 to 65 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 48 to 56 inches."

Binnsville soils are on similar positions and have a mollic epipedon and are clayey.  Eutaw, Houston, Kipling, Okolona, Oktibbeha, and Vaiden soils are generally at slightly higher elevations on smoother positions and are very deep to limestone bedrock. Griffith, Leeper, Sucarnoochee, and Trinity soils are in flood plains and are very deep to bedrock. Sumter and Watsonia soils are in similar positions as Demopolis soils. In addition, Sumter soils are moderately deep to soft limestone and Watsonia soils have vertic properties and are acid in the upper part."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The series classification was changed from loamy-skeletal to loamy in 1996. The chalk fragments are considered to be pararock, since they are mostly pulverized during sample processing.\nDiagnostic horizons and significant features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (Ap horizon).\nDepth to soft limestone - 13 inches (Cr horizon).\nDemopolis soils are in MLRAs 135A and 135B."
