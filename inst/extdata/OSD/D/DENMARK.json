They formed in alluvium and residuum derived from limestone, sandstone, quartzite, basic and intermediate igneous rocks.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C. Average annual precipitation ranges from 200 to 300 mm. Frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."

Arapien, Kessler, Lisade and Sanpete soils have a calcic horizon.  Linco soils have horizons of silica accumulation that are brittle when moist at a depth of 10 to 25 cm.  Sanpete soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments."
