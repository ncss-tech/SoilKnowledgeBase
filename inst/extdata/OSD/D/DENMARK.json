  "OVERVIEW": "The Denmark series consists of shallow over hardpan, well drained soils. These soils formed in alluvium and residuum derived from sedimentary and igneous rocks. They are on fan remnants, hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
