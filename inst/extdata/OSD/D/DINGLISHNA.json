  "OVERVIEW": "The Dinglishna series consists of shallow, very poorly drained soils formed in sandy and silty colluvium along the borders between muskegs and sandy terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 28 inches.",
