  "OVERVIEW": "The Doespring series consists of shallow to a cemented pan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone. The Doespring soils are on backslopes of rock pediments. Slope ranges from 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 360 millimeters (14 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C. (45 degrees F.).",
