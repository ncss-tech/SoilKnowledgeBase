  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Deletedn series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with glacial drift and colluvium over gneiss, granite, or granodiorite bedrock. Deletedn soils are found on slopes of 0 to 15 percent on bedrock benches and valley walls of glaciated mountain landscapes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,900 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
