  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Drumbay series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, high saturated hydraulic conductivity (rapidly permeable) soils that formed in eolian beach sands. These nearly level soils occur on slightly depressional backdune flats on barrier islands. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1245 mm (49 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F).",
