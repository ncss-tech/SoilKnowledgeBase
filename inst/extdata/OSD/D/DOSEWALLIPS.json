These soils are usually moist in the soil moisture control section and are dry 30 to 45 consecutive days during summer; udic moisture regime.  Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact has andic soil properties with an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention is 85 to 100 percent, 15-bar water retention of 12 to 20 percent for air dried samples, and 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume. Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.  It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 3, 4, or 6 dry.  It has 5 to 10 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist or dry.  It is extremely cobbly medial sandy loam, extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, or extremely cobbly medial loam.  Reaction is moderately or strongly acid.  It has 1 to 5 percent organic matter."
