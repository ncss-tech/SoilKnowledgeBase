  "OVERVIEW": "The Dart series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in glacial outwash and alluvium from acid igneous rocks.  Dart soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

Dart soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 12 and 35 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 15 to 50 percent coarse sand and very coarse sand and is 0 to 15 percent pebbles.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of or 3 dry or moist.  It ranges from loamy coarse sand to coarse sandy loam and is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.  It has less than 1 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4, 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or sand, and is 0 to 15 percent pebbles.  It is massive or has weak platy structure.\nThe C horizon is multicolored or has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, or sand and is 0 to 20 percent pebbles.  Faint iron staining is in the lower part in some pedons."
