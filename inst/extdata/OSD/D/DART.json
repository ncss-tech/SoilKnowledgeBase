Dart soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 12 and 35 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 15 to 50 percent coarse sand and very coarse sand and is 0 to 15 percent pebbles.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of or 3 dry or moist.  It ranges from loamy coarse sand to coarse sandy loam and is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.  It has less than 1 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4, 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or sand, and is 0 to 15 percent pebbles.  It is massive or has weak platy structure.\nThe C horizon is multicolored or has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, or sand and is 0 to 20 percent pebbles.  Faint iron staining is in the lower part in some pedons."
