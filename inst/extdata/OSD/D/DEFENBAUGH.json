  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are dry for more than three-fourths of the time when the soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F.  The soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. from about March 15 to about November 15.  The soil is dry between 8 and 21 inches from about May 15 to November 15.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.   The particle-size control section is less than 5 percent gravel and averages 18 to 35 percent clay.  Some pedons are laminated below 40 inches.  Depth to the lithologic discontinuity is 25 to 45 inches.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has 1 to 2 percent organic matter.  It has an EC of 2 to 8 mmhos./cm. and an SAR of 1 to 4.\nThe Bk and Bq horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or loam with 25 to 30 percent clay.  It has 0 to 15 percent durinodes."

Alvodest soils are sodic.  Davey soils have a sandy particle-size control section.  Deppy soils have a loamy argillic horizon over a strongly cemented duripan.  Dixon soils have a fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal particle-size control section.  Outerkirk soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section.  Tumtum soils have a loamy argillic horizon over a indurated duripan."
