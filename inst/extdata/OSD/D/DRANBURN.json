  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dranburn soils are on mountain slopes at elevations of 5,400 to 7,000 feet.  They formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium derived from quartzite with some loess influence.  Slopes are 15 to 45 percent.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 22 inches.  The average annual air temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.  The frost free period is 50 to 70 days."

Northwater soils have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section.  Robin soils are on similar landscape positions as Dranburn soils.  Robin soils have a fine-silty particle-size control section and the top of the argillic horizon is deeper than 24 inches.  Yeates Hollow soils are on south and west facing slopes lower on the landscape than Dranburn soils.  Yeates Hollow soils have a clayey-skeletal particle-size control section."

(the Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 22 to 42 inches (the Bt1 and part of the Bt2 horizon)\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Series classified according to Eleventh Edition, 2011.  The superactive CE activity class is presumed for this series based on the general trend indicated by lab data throughout this region.\nThe 06/2011 revision changes the moisture regime from xeric to udic. This brings this series in line with other series in MLRA 47 that have quaking aspen ecological sites.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
