  "OVERVIEW": "The Dyarock series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils in swales on mountains.  The soil formed in volcanic ash, pumice, cinders and andesite fragments on ash flows. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 70 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
