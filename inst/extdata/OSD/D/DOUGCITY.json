    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The particle-size control section averages 25 to 35 percent clay, and 35 to 50 percent rock fragments (mostly pebbles).  It contains 15 to 40 percent mica minerals in the very fine sand fraction.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 59 degrees F. The soil moisture control section between the depths of 15 and 35 inches is dry in all parts from about July 20 to October 20 (80 to 100  days). The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches exceeds 41 degrees F from about March 20 to December 10 (260  days), and exceeds 47 degrees F from about April 20 to November 10.  The particle-size control section has a ratio of extractable iron plus gibbsite to clay of 0.2 to 0.3 and contains less than 40 percent of any other mineral.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/4, 6/4, 7/4, 7.5YR 6/4, 6/6, or 5YR 4/4.  Moist color is 10YR 4/4, 5/6, 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, or 5YR 3/4.  The A horizon is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon is  5YR 6/6, 4/4, 7/6, 4/4, 4/6, 5/6, 5/8, 6/6, 6/8, 7.5YR 6/6 or 7/6.  Moist color is 5YR 4/6, 5/8, 4/4, 2.5YR 5/6, 4/6, 4/4, 5/8, or 7.5YR 4/6.  Chroma is 4 more than in the lower part.  It is very gravelly loam, very gravelly clay loam, gravelly loam, gravelly clay loam, or extremely gravelly clay loam.  The Bt is moderately acid to neutral.  Base saturation ranges from 50 to 75 percent by sum of cations."

Field estimates are used, with the assumption that weathered mica fragments crushed in in sample preparation influenced measured clay and 15 bar water content.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
