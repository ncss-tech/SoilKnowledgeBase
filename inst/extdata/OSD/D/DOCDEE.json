  "OVERVIEW": "The Docdee series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material derived mainly from andesite and sandstone.  These soils are on ridge tops and mountain sides and have slopes of 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches; the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
