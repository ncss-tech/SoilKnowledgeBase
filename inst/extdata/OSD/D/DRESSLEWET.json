  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dresslewet soils are on low stream terraces and alluvial fans.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources, but with a strong influence from granitic rocks such as granite and granodiorite.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 1,400 to 1,680 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."

Mottsville soils are sandy and do not have endosaturation within 150 cm of the soil surface.  Ophir soils are sandy and have aquic conditions within 50 cm of the soil surface."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 75 and 100 cm (moderately deep free water occurrence class) from December through May.  Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods year-round or occasional flooding for brief periods between December and May."
