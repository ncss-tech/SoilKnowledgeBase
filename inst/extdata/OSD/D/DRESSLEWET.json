  "OVERVIEW": "The Dresslewet series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Dresslewet soils are on low stream terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",

These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources, but with a strong influence from granitic rocks such as granite and granodiorite.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 1,400 to 1,680 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
