  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches thick, and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Typically these soils are noncalcareous throughout, but they are weakly calcareous immediately above the bedrock in some locations.  Organic carbon in the mollic epipedon ranges from 1 to 6 percent and decreases uniformly as depth increases.  The soil is 90 to 100 percent base saturated with exchangeable sodium and potassium remaining constant or increasing slightly as depth increases.  Typically the soils have no visible accumulation of secondary calcium carbonate except that there are weak coatings of calcium carbonate on the underside of limestone and shale fragments in the last few inches above the bedrock in some pedons.  The control section is usually light clay loam or heavy loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 55 percent silt, and 20 to 50 percent sand.  Coarse fragments range from 15 to 35 percent.  Bulk calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 6 to 10 percent due to limestone gravel.  The average annual soil temperature is 30 degrees F, and the average summer soil temperature is 45 degrees F.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It usually has strong granular or crumb structure, but it has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  This horizon is soft or slightly hard.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR.  It is typically massive or weak subangular blocky.  This horizon is slightly hard or hard.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."
