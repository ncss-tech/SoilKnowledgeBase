  "OVERVIEW": "The Deadsea series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils occur on fan remnants.  These soils are subject to prolonged saturation from flood irrigation.  Slopes are 1 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",

Under flood irrigation this soil is saturated with water in one or more layers within 100 cm of the mineral soil surface for more than or equal to 30 cumulative days.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
