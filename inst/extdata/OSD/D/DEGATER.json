  "OVERVIEW": "The Degater series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from shale.  Degater soils are on hillsides.  Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
