    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Typically, it has carbonates at the surface, but some pedons are leached of carbonates to a depth of 5 inches.  The clay content of the control section ranges from 18 to 30 percent and the control section typically contains much very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have an AC horizon with color and texture of the Bk horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It typically is loam or silt loam, but is clay loam or sandy clay loam in some pedons.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or very fine sandy loam.  It typically has soft accumulations of carbonate as seams and threads.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon is soft siltstone, sandstone or loamy shale.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Delphill soils are at elevations above 5,550 feet and have a shorter frost free period.  Hillon, Mussel, Patent, and Sinkson soils have bedrock below a depth of 40 inches.  In addition, Hillon soils formed in glacial till and Sinkson soils have a redder hue.  The Parman series is further west."
