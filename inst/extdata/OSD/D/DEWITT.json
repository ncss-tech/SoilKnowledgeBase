  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Combined thickness of the A and E horizons typically ranges from 12 to 24 inches. Solum thickness is typically more than 80 inches. The content of exchangeable sodium usually increases with depth and may range up to 20 percent in the lower part of the solum, but is too deep to meet the requirements of a natric horizon. Total sand content is less than 10 percent throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. A horizons with value of 3 are less 7 inches thick. Reaction normally ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid, but because of the addition of lime or irrigation water, it can range to neutral. Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of brown or gray.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silt loam or silt. Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of brown and gray. Reaction normally ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid, but because of the addition of lime or irrigation water, it can range to neutral.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. The upper part of the Btg horizon has common to many, prominent yellowish red, red, or dark red iron accumulations. Brown and gray iron accumulations and depletions may be present throughout. Texture is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam in the upper part and ranges to silt loam in the lower part. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nIn some pedons, a 2Bt horizon may be present at depths greater than 60 inches. It has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of brown and gray. Texture ranges from silt loam to clay. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are Alusa, Crowley, Kemah, Leaksville, and Meikle series in the same family and Cherokee and Meggett series in closely related families. Alusa soils have A and E horizons less than 12 inches thick and generally contains more sand throughout. Crowley soils have higher soil temperatures and are somewhat poorly drained. Kemah soils contain more sand throughout the solum and are somewhat poorly drained. Leaksville soils have 20 to 40 in sola over shale bedrock and contain shale and quartz fragments throughout. Meikle soils have mean annual precipitation of about 14 inches. In addition, they have sola less than 40 inches thick and contain more sand throughout. Cherokee soils have mixed mineralogy and do not have red iron accumulations in the upper B horizon. Meggett soils have mixed mineralogy and contain more sand throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dewitt soils are on the Grand Prairie of Arkansas and other similar Prairie terraces in the lower Mississippi Valley; MLRA 131. Slopes are typically less than 1 percent, but ranges to 3 percent. Circular mounds of about 50 to 75 feet in diameter and 15 to 30 inches high were common, but\nmost of these have been leveled. The parent material is mainly alluvium, but some areas may have been mixed with loess. The average annual temperature ranges from about 60 to 65 degrees F. and the average annual rainfall ranges from about 50 to 55 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ethel, Immanuel, Stuttgart and Tichnor series. Ethel soils, which occur on similar landscapes are in fine-silty particle size family; do not have an abrupt texture and contain a glossic horizon. Immanuel soils, typically occur on more dissected landscapes nearer the terrace escarpment, are in a fine-silty particle size family; contain a glossic horizon and are moderately well drained. Stuttgart soils, which occur on slightly higher positions are moderately well drained. Tichnor soils, which occur on floodplains, have a combined A and E horizon thickness greater than 24 inches and are in a fine-silty particle size family."
