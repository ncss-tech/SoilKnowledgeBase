  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to lamellae ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F. Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the solum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 to 3. Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon, 1 to 4 inches thick, with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. Surface texture is loamy sand. Reaction naturally ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral in Ap horizons where the soil is limed.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is typically sand or loamy sand but includes fine sand and loamy fine sand. Reaction naturally ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral where the soil is limed.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is typically sand, or loamy sand, but includes fine sand and loamy fine sand. Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid, but ranges to neutral where the soil is limed.\nThe E part of the E&Bt horizon, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is typically sand but some pedons are fine sand.\nThe Bt (lamellae) part of the E&Bt horizon, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is typically sand or loamy sand, but some pedons contain lamellae of fine sand or loamy fine sand. Lamellae of sand or loamy sand have at least 3 percent more clay than the E part. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is sand or loamy sand. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid. Some pedons do not have a C horizon."

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 900 to 1050 feet."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Drammen soils have been cleared and are used for cropland. Corn, soybeans, small grains, and hay are the principal crops. Some have been planted to pine trees and a few areas remain in woodland. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and pine forest."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Prior to 1996, Drammen soils were mapped as a loamy substratum or banded phase of the Plainfield series. Parent material is considered to be wind re-worked sandy outwash (sand sheets) which was subsequently moved downslope as alluvium. The lamellae are believed to have formed as a result of periodic deposition of fines from nearby loess covered hills to the alluvial deposits.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon: ochric epipedon - 0 to 9 inches (Ap); argillic horizon - 44 to 65 inches (Bt part of E&Bt with combined thickness of 6 inches or more).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Record - WI0598\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
