  "OVERVIEW": "The Deltajo series consists of well drained moderately permeable soils that are moderately deep to soft siltstone bedrock. Deltajo soils formed in alluvium derived from siltstone and are on cuestas.  Slopes range from 5 to 45 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and average annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.",

Weedpatch soils have hue commonly yellower than 10YR. In addition, Weedpatch soils are in the San Joaquin Valley (MLRA 17) and receive mostly winter precipitation and are usually dry from April through November."
