Bridge soils are moderately deep to volcanic ash or tuff and have hues yellower than 5YR. Chutum, Laverkin, Sotim, and Turney soils are all deeper than 40 inches. Weedpatch soils have hue commonly yellower than 10YR. In addition, Weedpatch soils are in the San Joaquin Valley (MLRA 17) and receive mostly winter precipitation and are usually dry from April through November."
