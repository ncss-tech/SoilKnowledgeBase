Bethera, Bladen, Cantey, Coxville, Grady, Leaf, and Rains soils lack dominant chromas of 3 or more between the A1 or Ap and thirty (30) inches of the soil surface. In addition, Bethera, Bladen, and Leaf soils have mixed mineralogy. Craven, Duplin, Exum, and Persanti soils have better drainage, and in addition Craven soils have mixed mineralogy and Exum soils are fine-silty. Lenoir, Lynchburg, Nahunta, and Wahee soils have similar drainage. Lenoir and Wahee soils have mixed mineralogy, and in addition Wahee soils contain more than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the sand and silt fraction. Lynchburg and Nahunta soils have 18 to 35 percent clay."

Faceville, Marlboro, Norfolk, and Wagram soils are well drained and are on the dryer parts of the landscape. In addition, Wagram soils have thick sandy surface layers. Goldsboro soils also have better drainage than the Dunbar soils, and they occur in intermediate positions between the Dunbar soils and the well drained soils on the landscape."
