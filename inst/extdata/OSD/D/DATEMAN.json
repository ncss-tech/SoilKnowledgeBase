  "OVERVIEW": "The Dateman series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils.  Dateman soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rock on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 3 to 80 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 27 inches and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
