  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dupee soils are in, depressions and drainageways on broad, gently sloping tops (summit position and interfluve component), and undulating side slopes (backslope, footslope, and toeslope positions) of hills along the margins of the Willamette Valley in Oregon. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevation is 170 to 800 feet where these soils occur on the Spencer Formation along the western margins of the Willamette Valley, 300 to 1,400 feet where these soils occur on the Eugene and Fisher formations along the eastern margin of the southern part of the Willamette Valley, and up to 2,500 feet in Douglas County. The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from marine tuffaceous sandstone, silstone, or mudstone of the Spencer Formation or from arkosic and micaceous sandstone, siltstone of the Eugene and Fisher Formations. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches. The frost-free season averages 160 to 235 days."

Bellpine soils have hue redder than 7.5YR, are fine textured, 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact, have less\nthan 35 percent base saturation in the argillic horizon, and occur adjacent hills at higher elevations. Carlton soils are greater than 60 inches dep to bedrock, have a mollic epipedon, and occur on adjacent footslopes and terraces. Chehulpum soils are less than 20 inches deep to a paralithic contact, and occur on hills. Hazelair soils are very fine textured, lack an argillic horizon and occur on hills. Jory soils have hue redder than 7.5YR, are fine textured, greater than 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact, have less than 35 percent base saturation in the argillic horizon, and occur on adjacent hills at higher elevations. Linslaw soils have redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less at a depth of less than 30 inches, are somewhat poorly drained, and occur along drainageways dissecting old terraces and on colluvial fans. Oakland soils are well drained, 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact, and occur on foothills. Panther soils are poorly drained, very fine textured, and occur in swales and concave drainageways on hills. Steiwer soils are fine-loamy, 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact, have a mollic epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick, and occur on hills. Wellsdale soils are moderately well drained, 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact, and occur hills. Willakenzie soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact, are well drained, and occur on hills.

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 24 inches (A1, A2, AB, and BA horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 24 to 51 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and BCt horizons)\nAquultic feature - the zone from 34 to 42 inches having redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less and the zone from24 to 42 inches having base saturation (sum) of less than 75 percent\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 24 to 44 inches (Bt1, Bt2 and upper 2 inches of the BCt horizon)\nThe typical pedon was relocated based on field documentation from the MLRA A2 Willamette Valley update project. The pedon reflects a modal series concept which includes: very deep to bedrock, somewhat poorly drained, brown hues, superactive cation exchange activity class, medium to moderately fine textures in argillic horizon, and occuring dominantly on the Eugene, Fisher, and Spencer geologic formations. The series occur along the margins of the Willamette Valley. It is differentiated from similar soils in fine families which occur on adjacent geologic formations which are derived from siltstone, have red hues, and an active cation exchange activity class. The Dupee series occur on the Dolph geomorphic surface.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
