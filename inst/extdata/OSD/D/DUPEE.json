Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevation is 170 to 800 feet where these soils occur on the Spencer Formation along the western margins of the Willamette Valley, 300 to 1,400 feet where these soils occur on the Eugene and Fisher formations along the eastern margin of the southern part of the Willamette Valley, and up to 2,500 feet in Douglas County. The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from marine tuffaceous sandstone, silstone, or mudstone of the Spencer Formation or from arkosic and micaceous sandstone, siltstone of the Eugene and Fisher Formations. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches. The frost-free season averages 160 to 235 days."

Chehulpum soils are less than 20 inches deep to a paralithic contact, and occur on hills. Hazelair soils are very fine textured, lack an argillic horizon and occur on hills. Jory soils have hue redder than 7.5YR, are fine textured, greater than 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact, have less than 35 percent base saturation in the argillic horizon, and occur on adjacent hills at higher elevations. Linslaw soils have redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less at a depth of less than 30 inches, are somewhat poorly drained, and occur along drainageways dissecting old terraces and on colluvial fans. Oakland soils are well drained, 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact, and occur on foothills. Panther soils are poorly drained, very fine textured, and occur in swales and concave drainageways on hills.

The pedon reflects a modal series concept which includes: very deep to bedrock, somewhat poorly drained, brown hues, superactive cation exchange activity class, medium to moderately fine textures in argillic horizon, and occuring dominantly on the Eugene, Fisher, and Spencer geologic formations. The series occur along the margins of the Willamette Valley. It is differentiated from similar soils in fine families which occur on adjacent geologic formations which are derived from siltstone, have red hues, and an active cation exchange activity class. The Dupee series occur on the Dolph geomorphic surface.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
