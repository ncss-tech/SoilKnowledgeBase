    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to soft bedrock typically is 20 to 30 inches, but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Some pedons have thin A horizons.  The A and E horizons have a combined thickness of 2 to 8 inches.  The depth to a horizon with visible salt or gypsum accumulations ranges from 5 to 14 inches.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 7 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A and E horizons are loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam or silty clay loam.  They are medium acid to neutral.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silty clay, clay, silty clay loam or clay loam averaging between 35 and 50 percent clay.  It has coarse or medium columnar structure that separates to blocky in most pedons.  It is very firm or firm.  It is neutral to strongly alkaline.  Clay films are on faces of columns.\nThe Btkn horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  Bty, Btz, Btkyz and Btkz horizons are allowed.  They have properties similar to the Btk horizon.  The combined thickness of these horizons ranges from 0 to 14 inches.\nThe Bky horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silty clay, silty clay loam, clay loam or loam.  It has few to common salt and/or gypsum crystals.  It is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  By, Bz, Bkyz, Bkz and Byz horizons are allowed.  They have properties similar to the Bky horizon. Combined thickness of these horizons ranges from 0 to 20 inches.  Some pedons have a Bk or BCy horizon.\nThe Cr horizon typically is platy soft shale, siltstone or mudstone bedrock.  Some pedons have a C horizon above the Cr horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dogtooth soils are on level to moderately steep uplands.  Slope gradients commonly are 1 to 15 percent but range from 0 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in residuum weathered from saline-alkali, calcareous soft shale, siltstone or mudstone.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 18 inches.  Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer."

Belfield, Daglum and Rhoades soils are on nearby foot slopes, swales and terraces.  These soils do not have soft bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches.  Cabba, Moreau, Reeder, Regent, Vebar and Wayden soils are on nearby uplands.  These soils do not have E horizons or Btn horizons that have strong columnar structure.   Janesburg soils are on positions similar to Dogtooth soils.  They do not have visible gypsum crystals or nests within depths of 16 inches."

Included with Rhoades or other series in older surveys in North Dakota and South Dakota.  Where this series is mapped near an ustic moisture regime that borders on an aridic, soils are included that classify as Natriboralfs.  Also included in mapping are similar soils that are shallow to soft bedrock.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
