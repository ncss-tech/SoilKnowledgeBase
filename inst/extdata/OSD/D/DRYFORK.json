  "OVERVIEW": "The Dryfork series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed silty eolian or lacustrine deposits.  These soils are on lake plains and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
