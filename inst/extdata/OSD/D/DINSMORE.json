  "OVERVIEW": "The Dinsmore series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) of loess and the underlying glacial till. Dinsmore soils are on interfluves, ridges and side slopes on dissected till plains. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about (33 inches).",
