  "OVERVIEW": "The Drummond series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in material weathered from loamy and clayey alluvium predominantly from Permian redbeds. These soils are on flood plains in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 in).",
