Catelli soils have an annual soil temperature of 56 to 58 degrees F. and are dry for more than 200 days after the summer solstice. Ginnis soils have a paralithic contact and are dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Shangland soils do not have O horizons and have a paralithic contact. Texascreek soils are dry 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice and have a paralithic contact. Roney soils do not have O horizons."
