  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Deerrun series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 8 to 90 percent in mountains and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
