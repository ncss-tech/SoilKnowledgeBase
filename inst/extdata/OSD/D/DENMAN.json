  "OVERVIEW": "The Denman series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils. The upper part of the soil formed in colluvium and the underlying part formed in material weathered from shale of Pennsylvanian age. These strongly sloping to steep upland soils are on sideslopes on the outer edge of the frontal belt of the Ouachita Mountains. Slopes range from 8 to 30 percent. Mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 46 inches.",

Bassfield, Latonia, and Rumford soils have a coarse-loamy control section. Bengal, Carnasaw, Cuthbert, Enders, Endsaw, Galilee, and Kirvin soils have a clayey control section. Bigfork, Saffell, and Zafra soils have a loamy-skeletal control section. Hartsells, Linker, Pirum, Sherwood, and Spadra soils do not have clayey IIB2t horizons. Honobia soils have a clay-skeletal control section. Kalmia and Maxtora soils have a fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal control section. Shermore soils have a fragipan."
