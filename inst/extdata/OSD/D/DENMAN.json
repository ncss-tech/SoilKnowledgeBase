The upper 15 inches of the control section has 30 percent or less clay content.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is stony loam or gravelly loam. Content of coarse fragments of sandstone ranges from 20 to 50 percent by volume. About 5 to 25 percent by volume is less than\n76 mm in diameter and 0 to 40 percent by volume is more than 76 mm in diameter. Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nSome pedons have A2 horizons that range up to 9 inches thick. The A2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture, reaction, and content of sandstone fragments are the same as the A1 horizon.\nThe B1 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is stony loam, stony clay loam, gravelly clay loam, gravelly loam, cobbly clay loam, or cobbly loam. Content of coarse fragments of sandstone ranges from 15 to 35 percent by volume. About 5 to 25 percent by volume is less than 76 mm in diameter and 0 to 20 percent by volume is more than 76 mm in diameter. Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nThe B21t horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown or red. The B21t horizon is clay loam, loam, gravelly clay loam, gravelly loam, cobbly clay loam, or cobbly loam. Content of coarse fragments of sandstone range from 10 to 30 percent by volume. About 5 to 30 percent by volume is less than 76 mm in diameter and 0 to 15 percent by volume is more than 76 mm in diameter. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe IIB22t horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8 with mottles in shades of red, brown, or gray. It is clay, silty clay, shaley clay, or shaley silty clay. Fragments of sandstone and shale less than 76 mm in diameter make up 5 to 30 percent by volume. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe IIB3 horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6. Some pedons are coarsely mottled or variegated in shades of red, brown, or gray. Texture, reaction, and content of coarse fragments of sandstone and shale are the same as the IIB22t horizon.\nThe IICr horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is shale or shaley clay that is tilted more than 20 degrees from horizontal. Reaction is neutral to moderately acid."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Soils in similar families are the Bassfield, Bengal, Bigfork, Carnasaw, Cuthbert, Enders, Endsaw, Galilee, Hartsells, Honobia, Kalmia, Kirvin, Latonia, Linker, Maxtora, Pirum, Rumford, Saffell, Sherwood, Shermore, Spadra, and Zafra series. Bassfield, Latonia, and Rumford soils have a coarse-loamy control section. Bengal, Carnasaw, Cuthbert, Enders, Endsaw, Galilee, and Kirvin soils have a clayey control section. Bigfork, Saffell, and Zafra soils have a loamy-skeletal control section. Hartsells, Linker, Pirum, Sherwood, and Spadra soils do not have clayey IIB2t horizons. Honobia soils have a clay-skeletal control section. Kalmia and Maxtora soils have a fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal control section. Shermore soils have a fragipan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Denman soils are on strongly sloping to sideslopes on the outer edge of the frontal belt of the Ouachita Mountains. The upper part of the soil formed in colluvium, and the underlying part formed in material weathered from shale of Pennsylvanian age. Slopes range from 8 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches. Mean annual temperatures range from 60 degrees to 66 degrees F. Thornthwaite annual P-E indices are greater than 64."

Bengal soils are on similar topographic position as Denman soils. Carnasaw and Pirum soils are usually on similar topographic positions as Denman soils but they are at higher elevations than Denman soils. Zafra soils are on sideslopes and footslopes. Clebit soils have a solum less than 20 inches thick over hard sandstone bedrock and they are on ridge crests or narrow benches on the sideslopes. Octavia and Panama soils are on sideslopes and footslopes. Octavia soils have a fine-loamy control section and Panama soils have a loamy-skeletal control section. Sobol and Tuskahoma soils have a clayey control section and are usually at lower elevations than the Denman soils."
