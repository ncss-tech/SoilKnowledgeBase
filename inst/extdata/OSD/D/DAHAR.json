The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 46 degrees F.  The moisture control section is usually dry, but is moist in some part 25 to 35 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 4l degrees F.  It is dry in all parts for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  However, it is not darker than value of 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist, both broken and crushed when mixed to a depth of 7 inches.  The horizon is noncalcareous to moderately calcareous and mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is moderately calcareous or strongly calcareous.\nThe Bqkm horizon has value of 7 or 8 dry and 6 or 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  This horizon is strongly cemented with some small areas of weak cementation but it is not indurated.\nThe C horizon has value of 7 or 8 dry and 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Clay content ranges from l0 to 20 percent and gravel range from 0 to 55 percent with textures of sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam and very gravelly sandy loam.  It is strongly calcareous or very strongly calcareous and moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
