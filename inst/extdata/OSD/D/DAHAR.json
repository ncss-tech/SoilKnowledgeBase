  "OVERVIEW": "The Dahar series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from tuffaceous sandstone and limestone.  The Dahar soils occur on dissected hillsides.  Slopes are 8 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

It is dry in all parts for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  However, it is not darker than value of 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist, both broken and crushed when mixed to a depth of 7 inches.  The horizon is noncalcareous to moderately calcareous and mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is moderately calcareous or strongly calcareous.\nThe Bqkm horizon has value of 7 or 8 dry and 6 or 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  This horizon is strongly cemented with some small areas of weak cementation but it is not indurated.\nThe C horizon has value of 7 or 8 dry and 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Clay content ranges from l0 to 20 percent and gravel range from 0 to 55 percent with textures of sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam and very gravelly sandy loam.
