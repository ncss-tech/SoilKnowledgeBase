  "OVERVIEW": "The Dahar series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from tuffaceous sandstone and limestone.  The Dahar soils occur on dissected hillsides.  Slopes are 8 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches (355 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F (6 degrees C).",
