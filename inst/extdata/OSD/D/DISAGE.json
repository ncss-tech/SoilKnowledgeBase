  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The average annual soil temperature at the lithic contact ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F.  These soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section more than half of the time.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 35 to 55 percent coarse fragments by volume.  Organic matter is estimated to range from 0.5 to 1 percent.  Solum thickness and depth of bedrock ranges from 14 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry, and a chroma of 2 or 3 moist.\nThe BAt horizon is a very gravelly clay loam or very cobbly clay loam.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, chroma of 3 through 5 dry or moist.  They are very gravelly clay loam, extremely cobbly clay loam, or very cobbly clay.  Structure is moderate to strong subangular blocky or prismatic."

Grumblen soils have carbonates in the lower argillic horizon and are moderately alkaline throughout.  Jung soils have moderately alkaline argillic horizons with free carbonates in the lower portion.  Loomis soils are 8 to 14 inches to bedrock.  Rocconda soils are mildly or moderately alkaline and have mainly channers in the control section."

Elevations are 500 to 2,000 feet.  These soils are in an arid climate with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 9 inches. The mean January temperature is about 29 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is about 50 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 135 to 195 days."

Kiona soils are on hillslopes and colluvial sideslopes and are loamy-skeletal and more than 40 inches deep.  Nevo soils are on hillslopes, ridgetops and benches and are loamy-skeletal and 5 to 12 inches to a lithic contact.  Sohappy soils are on benches and toeslopes and are coarse-loamy and more than 40 inches deep."
