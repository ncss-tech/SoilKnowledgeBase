  "OVERVIEW": "The Disage series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt, with additions of loess, on ridgetops and hill slopes. Slopes are 3 to 60 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 8 inches and average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The average annual soil temperature at the lithic contact ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F.  These soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section more than half of the time.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 35 to 55 percent coarse fragments by volume.  Organic matter is estimated to range from 0.5 to 1 percent.  Solum thickness and depth of bedrock ranges from 14 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry, and a chroma of 2 or 3 moist.\nThe BAt horizon is a very gravelly clay loam or very cobbly clay loam.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, chroma of 3 through 5 dry or moist.  They are very gravelly clay loam, extremely cobbly clay loam, or very cobbly clay.  Structure is moderate to strong subangular blocky or prismatic."
