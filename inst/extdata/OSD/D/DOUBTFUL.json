  "OVERVIEW": "The Doubtful series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained soils formed in mixed volcanic ash and glacial drift over glacial drift and residuum on ridges, valley walls, and bedrock benches.  Slopes are 15 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,800 millimeters.  The mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.",

These soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with reworked glacial drift over glacial drift and residuum.  The climate consists of cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,600 to 3,000 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 7 degrees C. Frost-free season is 30 to 60 days."

Forbidden soils also have coarser textures in the upper portion of the soil profile.  Stetattle soils have thick A horizons with higher amounts of organic carbon in the upper portion of the soil profile."
