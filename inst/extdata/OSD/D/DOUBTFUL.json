These soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with reworked glacial drift over glacial drift and residuum.  The climate consists of cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,600 to 3,000 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 7 degrees C. Frost-free season is 30 to 60 days."

Forbidden and Tepeh soils have less than 36 cm of andic soil material and are usually on more active landscape positions of valley walls and debris cones.  Forbidden soils also have coarser textures in the upper portion of the soil profile.  Stetattle soils have thick A horizons with higher amounts of organic carbon in the upper portion of the soil profile."
