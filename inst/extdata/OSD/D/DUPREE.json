  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedded shale ranges from 25 to 50 cm.  The soil typically ranges from medium acid to slightly alkaline; however, strongly and extremely acid phases have been recognized.  Typically the soils do not have free carbonate but some pedons have slight effervescence.  The control section averages between 50 and 70 percent clay.  The soil typically is extremely hard when dry.  Colors are inherent to the parent material.  When the soil is dry, cracks 10 to 50 mm wide extend through the solum.  A weak crust typically occurs at the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 (3 to 5 moist) and chroma of 1 or 2.  Where it has value of less than 5.5 and 3.5 moist, it is less than 10 cm thick.  It is clay or silty clay.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 (3 to 5 moist) and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay.  Some pedons may contain up to 60 percent by volume parafragments of shale.  Some pedons may contain accumulations of gypsum and other salts.\nSome pedons have a C horizon.\nThe Cr horizon is weakly cemented shale and has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y.  It typically has thin seams of gypsum and other salts in the upper part."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 9 degrees C and mean annual precipitation from 330 to 510 mm."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chantier, Oko, Opal, Promise, and Sansarc soils.  Chantier, Opal, and Sansarc soils are on similar landscape positions.  Opal soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Sansarc soils are more friable and contain free carbonate throughout. Oko soils have an argillic horizon and formed in clayey glacial till and are above the Dupree soils.  Promise soils are very deep and occur on plane to slightly concave, gently sloping fans and toe slopes below the Dupree soils.  Badlands miscellaneous areas are typically associated with the Dupree soils."

Little bluestem, big bluestem, prairie sandreed, and needleleaf sedge commonly occur on strongly and extremely acid phases."
