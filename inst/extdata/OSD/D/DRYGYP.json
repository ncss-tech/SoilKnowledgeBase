  "OVERVIEW": "The Drygyp series consists of very shallow to a petrogypsic horizon, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from gypsum rock. Drygyp soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F.",

The climate is that of a low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to Sonoran Desert.  The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches, the mean annual temperature is 70 to 75 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 300 to 360 days."
