  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Drygyp soils are on fan remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived from gypsum rock. Slope ranges from 2 to 15 percent. Elevations are 1,200 to 2300 feet. The climate is that of a low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to Sonoran Desert.  The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches, the mean annual temperature is 70 to 75 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 300 to 360 days."
