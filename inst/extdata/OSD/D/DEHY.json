  "OVERVIEW": "The Dehy series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Dehy soils are on alluvial fans and low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C.",
