The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 53 degrees F.  The soils are strongly acid to slightly acid, becoming less acid with depth.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days.  They average 50 to 70 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section.\nThe E horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam.\nThe Bs horizon has value and chroma of 3 or 4 moist.  It contains 5 to 10 percent iron-manganese shot.\nThe BC horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 moist.  It has redox concentrations with chroma greater than 2  in some pedons.\nThe 2Bsm horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has redox concentrations with chroma greater than 2 in some pedons.  It is weakly cemented."

These soils formed in very gravelly ablation glacial material overlying extremely firm glacial till derived from mixed rock sources.  The glacial till occurs at 24 to 36 inches in depth.  The climate is cool and dry in the summer and mild and wet in the winter.  Annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 45 inches.  The average July temperature is 59 degrees F., the average January temperature is 29 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F.  The growing season is about 258 days above 28 degrees F."

Olete soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact."

This soil has the morphology of a Spodosol (3/24/94) if the albic horizon is not a volcanic ash layer.  Classification changed 1/2000 from Vitrandic Durochrepts to Vitrandic Dystroxerepts based on revision to Soil Taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon\nAlbic horizon - from 3 to 5 inches\nCambic horizon - from 5 to 31 inches\nCemented pan - beginning at 31 inches and cemented with aluminum, iron, and organic matter.\nVitrandic subgroup feature - from 3 to 31 inches having estimated properties of > 5 percent volcanic glass and 0.4 to 1.0 percent acid-oxalate Al plus 1/2 Fe.\nOxyaquic feature - a perched water table from 24 to 30 inches at times from November through March.\nParticle-size control section - from 13 to 31 inches.\nDepths to diagnostic horizons and features as noted in range of characteristics are measured from the to of the first mineral horizon."
