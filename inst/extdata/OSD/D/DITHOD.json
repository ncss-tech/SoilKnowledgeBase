Elevations range from 1,158 to 1,341 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 110 to 150 days."

Fallon soils have mainly sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the particle-size control section and have ochric epipedons.  Sagouspe soils are sandy, calcareous, and have ochric epipedons."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 90 and 150 cm (moderately deep and deep free water occurrence classes) from December through September.  Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for brief periods or occasional flooding for long periods between December and June."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Dithod soils are used mainly for irrigated cropland.  Most areas have been cleared, leveled, and irrigated.  Alfalfa, small grains, corn, and legume-grass pastures are the principal crops.  The native vegetation is basin big sagebrush and some perennial grasses or black greasewood and inland saltgrass in the more saline-sodic areas."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 38 cm (Ap and A horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 90 and 150 cm at certain times during normal years (parts of the C2 and 2C3 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (C1 horizon and parts of the A and C2 horizons).\nThe revision of March 2003 changed the particle-size class from Fine-loamy to Coarse-loamy after field study of the series type location.  Some Dithod components in Churchill, Lyon, and Washoe Counties, Nevada need future correlation to other soil series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
