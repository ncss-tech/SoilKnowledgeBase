  "OVERVIEW": "The Dithod series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Dithod soils are on flood plains and low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 90 and 150 cm (moderately deep and deep free water occurrence classes) from December through September.  Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for brief periods or occasional flooding for long periods between December and June."

Alfalfa, small grains, corn, and legume-grass pastures are the principal crops.  The native vegetation is basin big sagebrush and some perennial grasses or black greasewood and inland saltgrass in the more saline-sodic areas."

Some Dithod components in Churchill, Lyon, and Washoe Counties, Nevada need future correlation to other soil series."
