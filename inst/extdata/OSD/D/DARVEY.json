  "OVERVIEW": "The Darvey series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium from calcareous sandstone, shale and limestone.  These soils are on hills, fan terraces, and valley fill.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.",
