    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 36 to 60 inches.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 42 to 80 inches.  The rock fragment content by volume is 1 to 10 percent with 1 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 2 percent cobbles and 0 to 1 percent stones.  The rock fragments are of mixed lithology, but are mostly of igneous origin. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F.\nSome pedons have an Oa or Oe horizon as much as 2 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  It has 20 to 50 percent fine sand or coarser and 5 to 20 percent clay.  It is very strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The redder hue is only in the lower part and the lower value is only in the upper part.  Subhorizon with moist value of 3 have dry value of more than 5. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. It has 20 to 50 percent fine sand or coarser and 5 to 20 percent clay. It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.  The E horizon extends into the B horizon as tongues.\nThe glossic horizon consists of E/B or B/E or both.  The E and Bt parts each occupy between 15 and 85 percent of the horizon.  The E part has similar colors and textures given for the E horizon.  The Bt part has similar colors and textures given in the Bt horizons.  Some pedons have 2E/B or 2B/E horizons or both.\nThe Bt horizon has 2.5YR or 5YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features in the upper part. It is loam or clay loam typically averaging between 20 to 45 percent fine sand or coarser and 20 to 35 percent clay. The B/A clay ratio ranges from 2 to 4.  Clay films in the Bt horizon are thin to thick and common to many in the upper part grading to few and thin in the lower part. It is moderately acid or strongly acid in the upper part and slightly acid or neutral in the lower part.  Some pedons have 2Bt horizons.\nThe C horizon has 2.5YR or 5YR hue with value and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  It has 20 to 45 percent fine sand or coarser and 18 to 30 percent clay. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have 2C horizons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are in the Freer, Keewatin, and Stuntz series.  Freer soils have dense till (paralithic contact) with bulk density greater than 1.8 within the series control section.  Keewatin and Stuntz soils have hue of 10YR or yellower throughout the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils have plane or slightly convex slopes range from 0 to 3 percent on gently undulating to rolling moraines and till floored lake plains.  They formed primarily in reddish brown, loam or clay loam glacial till of the Superior lobe of the late Wisconsin glaciation.  A thin mantle of aeolian or water-deposited sediments overlies the till in some places.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 43 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 30 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 145.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 900 to 1600 feet."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  The main ones are the Baden (T), Blackhoof, Duluth, Mahtowa, and Ellsburg (T), series which are members of a drainage sequence with the Dusler soils and which formed in similar materials.  The very poorly drained Baden soils are in concave swales and shallow depressions.  The very poorly drained Blackhoff soils have a histic epipedon and have concave slopes.  The well and moderately well drained Duluth soils have convex slopes and are on higher lying or more sloping terrain.  The poorly drained Mahtowa and Ellsburg are on lower lying concave slopes.  Organic soils also are common associates."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 22 inches (A, E and E/B horizons); albic horizon - the zone from 4 to 22 inches (E1, E2 and 2E/B horizons); glossic horizon - the zone from 15 to 22 inches (E/B horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from 22 to 55 inches (Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons).  Other features are:  frigid temperature regime; aquic moisture regime based on water table and capillary saturation to the surface.  Reddish colors of the parent material in the Bt and C horizons mask the low chroma of Fe depletions.  A positive reaction to alpha-alpha-dipyridol is assumed. 1/18/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected.\nThis series concept is currently under review for bulk density, soil moisture status and slope classes.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to Minnesota Ag. Exp. Station Central File Code numbers CFC 2643 and CFC 3133 for laboratory analysis of representative pedons.  Soil Interpretation Record number is MN0160.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
