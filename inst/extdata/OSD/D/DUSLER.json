  "OVERVIEW": "The Dusler series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy glacial till on till floored lake plains, and moraines. Permeability is moderate in the mantle and slow in the underlying material. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches.",

The rock fragments are of mixed lithology, but are mostly of igneous origin. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F.\nSome pedons have an Oa or Oe horizon as much as 2 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  It has 20 to 50 percent fine sand or coarser and 5 to 20 percent clay.  It is very strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The redder hue is only in the lower part and the lower value is only in the upper part.  Subhorizon with moist value of 3 have dry value of more than 5. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. It has 20 to 50 percent fine sand or coarser and 5 to 20 percent clay. It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.  The E horizon extends into the B horizon as tongues.\nThe glossic horizon consists of E/B or B/E or both.  The E and Bt parts each occupy between 15 and 85 percent of the horizon.  The E part has similar colors and textures given for the E horizon.  The Bt part has similar colors and textures given in the Bt horizons.

They formed primarily in reddish brown, loam or clay loam glacial till of the Superior lobe of the late Wisconsin glaciation.  A thin mantle of aeolian or water-deposited sediments overlies the till in some places.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 43 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 30 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 145.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 900 to 1600 feet."

The very poorly drained Baden soils are in concave swales and shallow depressions.  The very poorly drained Blackhoff soils have a histic epipedon and have concave slopes.  The well and moderately well drained Duluth soils have convex slopes and are on higher lying or more sloping terrain.  The poorly drained Mahtowa and Ellsburg are on lower lying concave slopes.  Organic soils also are common associates."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 22 inches (A, E and E/B horizons); albic horizon - the zone from 4 to 22 inches (E1, E2 and 2E/B horizons); glossic horizon - the zone from 15 to 22 inches (E/B horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from 22 to 55 inches (Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons).  Other features are:  frigid temperature regime; aquic moisture regime based on water table and capillary saturation to the surface.  Reddish colors of the parent material in the Bt and C horizons mask the low chroma of Fe depletions.  A positive reaction to alpha-alpha-dipyridol is assumed. 1/18/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected.\nThis series concept is currently under review for bulk density, soil moisture status and slope classes."
