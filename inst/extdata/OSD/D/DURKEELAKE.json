The Durkeelake soils formed in sandy outwash and the underlying loamy glaciofluvial deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 610 to 762 mm (24 to 30 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 7.2 degrees C (40 to 45 degrees F)."

The moderately well drained Croswell soils formed entirely in sandy material on similar landscape positions. The somewhat excessively drained Graycalm soils, the excessively drained Grayling soils, and the well drained Klacking soils are on similar or slightly higher landscape positions. The very poorly drained Leafriver and Tawas soils are in depressions."

Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 61 to 107 cm (2 to 3.5 feet) between November and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low, depending on slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the sandy material and moderately high in the underlying loamy material. Permeability is rapid in the sandy material and moderate or moderately slow in the underlying loamy material."
