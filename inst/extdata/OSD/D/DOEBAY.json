  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Billscabin, Inskip, and Turtleback series. Billscabin soils are more than 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Inskip soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 57 degrees F, and rock fragments are vesicular basalt from recent lava flows. Turtleback soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Series with similar classification but mixed mineralogy include the Atring, Barpeak, Beekman, Farber, Firmountain, Forgay, Geppert, Half Dome, Hartless, Hilltish, Howler, Kanid, Kindig, Mayacama, Neuns, Sheetiron, Straight, Woodin, and Vena soils. Atring, Geppert, and Straight soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Barpeak, Farber, Forgay, and Half Dome soils are very deep. Beekman, Howler, and Woodin soils have greater than 18 percent clay in the control section. Firmountain soils do not have a lithic contact because fractures are less than 4 inches apart, and have flat phyllite or schist rock fragments. Hartless, Kanid, and Kindig soils have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Hilltish soils formed in material weathered from conglomerate and have rounded rock fragments. Mayacama, Neuns, and Sheetiron soils are dry in the soil moisture control section for more than 90 days, and are in an active cation-exchange activity class. Vena soils have acid igneous rock fragments, dominantly rhyolite."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Doebay soils occur on mountainsides and hillsides at elevations of sea level to 2,400 feet. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. These soils formed in glacial drift mixed with colluvium from bedrock of metasedimentary lithology. The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and mild moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 40 inches. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is 200 to 240 days."

Hiddenridge soils have a mollic epipedon. Morancreek soils have a lithic contact greater than 60 inches from the soil surface. Turtleback soils have a lithic contact between 40 and 60 inches."
