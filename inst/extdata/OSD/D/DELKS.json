  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the Bh horizon is less than 30 inches.  Depth to the Btg horizon is more than 37 inches.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value 2 to 4, chroma 2 or less; or it is neutral with value of 2.  When dry, this horizon has a salt and pepper appearance due to a mixture or organic matter and uncoated sand grains.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 or less.  Streaks and organic matter accumulations and depletions in shades of black, gray, brown, and yellow range from few to common.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe Eg&Bh horizon, where present, is discontinuous and has the same range of colors as the E horizon and the Bh horizon.  Content of weakly to strongly cemented organic bodies range from 0 to 40 percent.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Organic matter depletions in shades of red, brown, or yellow range from few to many.  It is very weakly to strongly cemented in 50 to 90 percent of the horizon.  Root channels ranging up to 1.0 inch in diameter and filled with strongly cemented sand in shades of brown, gray, or black range from none to many.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy sand.\nIn some pedons a discontinuous layer of weakly cemented sand ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 inches in thickness is between the Bh horizon and the Btg horizon.  It has the same range of colors and textures as the Btg horizon.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 6.   Redoximorphic accumulations in shades of red, brown, or yellow range from few to many.  Texture is sandy clay or clay."

The very poorly and poorly drained Ankona, Nettles, and Waveland soils are on similar to lower positions and have Bh horizons below a depth of 30 inches.  In addition, Nettles soils have high base saturation in the argillic horizons and Waveland soils do not have argillic horizons.  Eureka soils are on similar to lower positions, do not have Bh horizons, and have clayey control sections.  The very poorly and poorly drained Immokalee, Myakka, and Wabasso soils are on similar to lower positions and lack ortstein.  In addition, Immokalee soils are more than 30 inches deep to the Bh horizon, and Myakka soils do not have argillic horizons, and Wabasso soils have high base saturation and have argillic horizons within 37 inches of the surface.  The moderately well to excessively drained Jonathan soils are on higher positions, are more than 50 inches deep to the Bh horizon, and lack ortstein.  Lawnwood, Ona, Pepper, and Salerno soils are on similar positions.  In addition, Lawnwood, Ona, and Salerno soils lack argillic horizons, Ona soils do not have ortstein, Pepper soils have loamy argillic horizons with high base saturation, and Salerno soils have Bh horizons below 50 inches.  The somewhat poorly drained to moderately well drained Pomello soils do not have ortstein or argillic horizons.  The excessively drained St. Lucie soils are on higher positions, do not have Bh horizons or ortstein, and are sandy throughout."
