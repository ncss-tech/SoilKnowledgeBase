Rock fragment content of the control section ranges from 10 to 30 percent.  Reaction throughout the control section ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid, but the pH does not range below 5.5 throughout the control section.\nThe A1 horizon has hue from 5YR through 10YR, value from 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 15 to 60 percent and includes 10 to 40 percent cobbles and 5 to 20 percent gravel.\nThe A2 horizon, when present, has hue from 5YR to 10YR, value from 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 15 to 60 percent and includes 10 to 40 percent cobbles and 5 to 20 percent gravel.\nThe 2Bg horizon is gleyed with hue moist of 5GY, 2.5Y or 5Y; value moist from 2 through 5; chroma moist from 1 through 4.
