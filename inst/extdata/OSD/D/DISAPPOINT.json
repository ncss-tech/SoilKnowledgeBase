  "OVERVIEW": "The Disappoint series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in a thin silty loess mantle over coarse and medium textured glacial till.  Disappoint soils are in depressions on glacial till plains and toeslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F.",
