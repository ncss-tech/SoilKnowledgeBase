  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision recognizes that the lithic contact is deeper (40 to 60 inches) and that typically a lag line of limestone fragments occur within 20 to 40 inches of the surface. This lag line apparently was considered to be a lithic contact. Minimal change in interpretations will result due to the upper part being clayey.\nClassification is changed 11/89 from fine-silty, carbonatic, thermic Typic Calciustolls to fine-silty, carbonatic, thermic Udic Calciustolls.\nEdited 12/2016 (RFG-TRD): Converted to tabular format and added metric units. Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nParticle-size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in)\nMollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 33 cm (0 to 13 in)\nCambic horizon - the zone from 33 to 48 cm (13 to 19 in)\nCalcic horizon - the zone from 48 to 132 cm (19 to 52 in)\nCalcium carbonate equivalent is more than 40 percent.\nLithic contact - occurs at 132 cm (52 in)\nADDITIONAL DATA: S82TX099001 (TAMU); S1963TX099001 (Coryell Co.)
