  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "RAL-PTC-TWN",
  "REVDATE": "12/2003",
  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Deloit series consists of very deep, well drained soils on foot slopes on uplands and alluvial fans. These soils formed in local loamy alluvium or colluvium derived from pre-Wisconsin glacial till. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 74 centimeters (29 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F).",
