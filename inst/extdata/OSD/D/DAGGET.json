Alflack soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Canlodore soils have albic E horizons and an ustic moisture regime. Castlepeak and Chena soils are on glacial outwash fans and stream terraces and do not have bedrock within 60 inches. Cryomont soils are on low terraces and alluvial fans, have greater than 60 percent volcanic ash in the surface horizons and are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock. Eklutna has a udic moisture regime. Graylock soils are 100 to 150 cm deep to a lithic contact. Nataga soils are on alluvial fans and toeslopes and do not have bedrock within 150 cm. Nizina soils are on floodplains and stream terraces and do not have bedrock within 150 cm. Obscurity and Studebaker soils have a udic moisture regime, lack ochric epipedons, and have 15 to 50 percent volcanic glass in the particle-size control section. Perfecto soils have albic horizons and an ustic moisture regime. Ragamuffin and Stecum soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to paralithic contact."
