  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock from 40 to 60 inches.  The soil has cracks in most years one or more centimeters wide to a depth of 20 inches.  The reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the upper part of the solum and strongly acid to mildly alkaline in the lower part and in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon and AB horizon, where present, have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 to 3 or is neutral.  The E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 1 or 2 or is neutral.  The texture of these horizons is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 1 or 2 or is neutral.  Mottles of higher chroma range from few to many.  The texture is clay except the upper few inches is silty clay in some pedons.  The BC or Cg horizon has colors and textures like the Btg horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Closely related series in other families are the Ashford, Baldwin, Jackport, Ketona, Mayhew, Sessum and Tensas soils.  Ashford soils have a solum greater than 60 inches thick.  Baldwin, Mayhew, Sessum and Tensas are in a fine textural class and have montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Jackport soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy and are greater than 60 inches to bedrock.  Ketona soils are very similar except they are in a fine textural class."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils formed in clayey sediments or stream terraces and uplands.  Slopes are dominantly less than 5 percent, but range from 0 to 8 percent.  Near the type location mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F and average annual precipitation is about 45 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Capshaw, Colbert, Hamphire, Inman, Talbott and Tupelo series.  The moderately well drained Capshaw and somewhat poorly drained Tupelo soils are on stream terraces and uplands in positions similar to Dowellton.  Both of these soils are in fine textural families.  Capshaw soils have chroma of 4 or higher in the B horizon.  Tupelo soils have chroma of 3 or higher in the upper part of the B horizon.  Colbert soils are on uplands and have a chroma of 4 or higher in the B horizon.  Hampshire, Inman and Talbott soils are on adjacent uplands.  They are higher on the landscape and are well drained."
