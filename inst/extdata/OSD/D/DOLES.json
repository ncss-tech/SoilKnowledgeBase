Depth to top of the fragipan ranges from 20 to 30 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is commonly very strongly acid to medium acid but ranges to neutral where limed.\nAn E horizon is present in many pedons.\nThe BE horizon or BA horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 1 to 4, and is mottled.  It is strongly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 2 to 4, and is mottled.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 6.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is medium acid to very strongly acid.\nSome pedons have a C horizon that has similar color and texture range as the BC horizon.  It is medium acid to very strongly acid in the upper part and medium acid to slightly acid below a depth of about 80 inches.\nSome pedons have 2B and 2C horizons where a lithologic discontinuity can be identified between the loess and silty colluvium or old alluvium."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Avonburg, Bartle, Dubois, Platea, Wadsworth, and Weinbach series.  Avonburg soils contain more sand in the lower part of the solum.  Bartle soils have stratification in the underlying material and typically have the fragipan at a depth of more than 30 inches.  Dubois soils have stratification in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon.  Platea soils formed in glacial till and do not have an argillic horizon above the fragipan.  Wadsworth soils contain coarse fragments and contain more sand in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum.  Weinbach soils have mica flakes in the solum and typically have thicker solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Doles soils are on valley fills in abandoned preglacial drainage systems of the Allegheny Plateau.  Slope gradients are 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in loess and silty colluvium or old alluvium.  In most areas the loess mantle is up to 24 inches thick.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 38 to 43 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from about 52 to 56 degrees F."

All of these soils, except the Omulga soils, lack a fragipan.  Allegheny soils are fine-loamy and are on more sloping areas.  Omulga soils are moderately well drained soils and typically are on more sloping areas.  Piopolis soils are poorly drained and very poorly drained soils on nearby flood plains.  Richland soils are fine-loamy and are on toeslopes.  Tygart and Wyatt soils have more clay.  Tygart soils are on similar topographic positions,  but Wyatt soils are moderately well drained and are on higher topographic positions or on more sloping areas.  Weinbach soils have mica flakes in the solum."
