  "STATES": "OH,PA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Doles series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess and silty colluvium or old alluvium in valley fills in abandoned preglacial drainage systems in the Allegheny Plateau.  These soils have moderately slow permeability above the fragipan and slow permeability in the fragipan.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 41 inches, and mean annual temperature is 54 degrees F.",

It is strongly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 2 to 4, and is mottled.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 6.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is medium acid to very strongly acid.\nSome pedons have a C horizon that has similar color and texture range as the BC horizon.  It is medium acid to very strongly acid in the upper part and medium acid to slightly acid below a depth of about 80 inches.\nSome pedons have 2B and 2C horizons where a lithologic discontinuity can be identified between the loess and silty colluvium or old alluvium."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Avonburg, Bartle, Dubois, Platea, Wadsworth, and Weinbach series.  Avonburg soils contain more sand in the lower part of the solum.  Bartle soils have stratification in the underlying material and typically have the fragipan at a depth of more than 30 inches.  Dubois soils have stratification in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon.  Platea soils formed in glacial till and do not have an argillic horizon above the fragipan.  Wadsworth soils contain coarse fragments and contain more sand in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum.  Weinbach soils have mica flakes in the solum and typically have thicker solum."

All of these soils, except the Omulga soils, lack a fragipan.  Allegheny soils are fine-loamy and are on more sloping areas.  Omulga soils are moderately well drained soils and typically are on more sloping areas.  Piopolis soils are poorly drained and very poorly drained soils on nearby flood plains.  Richland soils are fine-loamy and are on toeslopes.  Tygart and Wyatt soils have more clay.  Tygart soils are on similar topographic positions,  but Wyatt soils are moderately well drained and are on higher topographic positions or on more sloping areas.  Weinbach soils have mica flakes in the solum."
