  "OVERVIEW": "The Doby series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in material derived from semiconsolidated shale. These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
