  "OVERVIEW": "The Dix series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils. Very gravelly sandy material is at a depth of 10 to 20 inces. Permeability is rapid in the solum and very rapid in the very gravelly sand. They formed in loamy, sandy, and gravelly soil material deposited over gravelly material on stream terraces, alluvial fans, foot slopes, and uplands. Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 18 inches at the type location.",
