Amelar soils have a mollic epipedon that is less than or equal to 38 cm thick and secondary carbonates from a depth of 25 to 36 cm.  Broad, Milk (T), Sheepcreek, and Small soils are moderately deep.  Custco soils have a mollic epipedon that is less than or equal to 38 cm thick and less than 27 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Drage, Remount, and Searla soils lack a calcic horizon.  Rawnjay soils have a calcic horizon that contains 5 to15 percent calcium carbonate in the upper part of the calcic horizon and 15 to 40 percent in the lower part of the calcic horizon.  Scalfar soils have a mollic epipedon that is less than or equal to 36 cm thick. Swampydraw soils have an argillic horizon beginning above 25 cm."
