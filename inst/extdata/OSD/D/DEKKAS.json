    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dekkas soils are on outwash plains between basaltic lava flows.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in outwash material from tephra deposited in Thousand Lakes Valley and transported downstream through Gulch Eiler.  Elevation is 4,600 to 5,000 feet.  The climate is sub humid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 35 to 45 inches.  Snowfall is 60 to 96 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 39 to 41 degrees F. Frost-free season is 50 to 80 days."

Twinbuttes soils are on cindercones and lava flows and are medial-skeletal.  Wengler soils are on lava flows and escarpments adjacent to outwash plains and are ashy-skeletal."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nThe Bb horizon is thought to represent evidence that the Dekkas series was deposited over the more highly developed Scarface and Gasper soils.  Block faulting of the Hatcreek Valley has left the Scarface and Gasper soils exposed to the east of the area where Dekkas is mapped.\nMineralogy is dominantly amorphic (allophane/imogolite).\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to about 3 inches (A horizon),\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This pedon was characterized by UC Davis in 1988.  Sample number is 88CA-089-09 unpublished.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
