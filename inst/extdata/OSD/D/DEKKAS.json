    "content": "REMARKS:\nThe Bb horizon is thought to represent evidence that the Dekkas series was deposited over the more highly developed Scarface and Gasper soils.  Block faulting of the Hatcreek Valley has left the Scarface and Gasper soils exposed to the east of the area where Dekkas is mapped.\nMineralogy is dominantly amorphic (allophane/imogolite).\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to about 3 inches (A horizon),\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This pedon was characterized by UC Davis in 1988.  Sample number is 88CA-089-09 unpublished.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
