  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Soil depth ranges from 10 to 20 inches over sandstone bedrock.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  Coarse fragments of sandstone or chert range from 0 to 30 percent by volume in the sola or individual horizons.\nThe A horizon ranges from brown or light brown to reddish brown or reddish yellow in hue of 5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand. Coarse fragments of sandstone or siliceous pebbles and cobbles comprise 0 to 15 percent by volume.\nThe Bt horizon ranges from red or reddish brown to yellowish red or reddish yellow in hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or loam or their gravelly counterparts with a clay content of 12 to 25 percent.\nThe Cr layer is weakly cemented sandstone bedrock;  The Cr layer in some pedons is interbedded with unconsolidated loamy and clayey sediments.  The Cr layer can be dug with a spade when moist.  The Cr may contain masses and strata of strongly cemented sandstone or ironstone."

Series in similar families are Cuevitas, Delmita, Duval, Jimenez, Lacoste, Quemado, Randado, Sharvana, Verick, and Zapata series.  Cuevitas, Delmita, Lacoste, Randado, and Sharvana soils have a petrocalcic horizon.  In addition, Sharvana soils have soil temperatures less than 72 degrees F.  Delmita and Duval soils have sola more 20 inches thick.  Jimenez and Quemado soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in their sola, and in addition, Jimenez soils are calcareous. Verick soils have hue of 2.5Y and 10YR and are calcareous.  Zapata soils are calcareous and lack an argillic horizon."

Climate is semiarid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 28 inches and mean annual air temperature ranges from 70 to 74 degrees F.,  Frost free days range from 250 to 320 days and elevation ranges from 450 to 800 feet.

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly rangeland, but some areas are farmed and most of these areas are irrigated.  Peanuts, melons, grain sorghum, winter vegetables, and tame pasture are the main crops.  Native vegetation consists of mid grasses, a few short grasses, about 5 percent woody shrubs and 10 percent perennial forbs. Typical forbs are velvet bundleflower, bushsunflower, and orange zexmania.  As retrogression occurs, such mid grasses as tanglehead and silver bluestem decrease.  Woody shrubs and short grasses increase or invade. Typical increasers and invaders are guajillo, blackbrush, leatherstem, hooded windmillgrass, sand dropseed, threeawn, and red grama."
