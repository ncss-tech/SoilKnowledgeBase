    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Dashiki soils are on volcanic plateaus. Slopes are undulating to rolling and range from 2 to 12 percent. The soil formed in a thick mantle of local alluvium derived from tephra and loess over tephra. The rock fragments and size component and rock fragments are dominantly obsidian. Elevations range from 7,200 to 8,300 feet. The average annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 65 inches. Mean annual air temperature is 32 to 37 degrees F. Frost may occur at anytime throughout the year."
