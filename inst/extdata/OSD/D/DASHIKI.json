  "OVERVIEW": "The Dashiki series consists of very deep and well drained soils on undulating to rolling areas of volcanic plateaus and formed in a mantel of local alluvium derived from tephra and loess over tephra. Slopes are 2 to 12 percent. Dashiki soils have moderately rapid permeability in the upper part and very rapid permeability in the lower part. The mean annual precipitation is about 1300 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 1 degrees C.",
