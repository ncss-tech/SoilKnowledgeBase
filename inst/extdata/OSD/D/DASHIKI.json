  "OVERVIEW": "The Dashiki series consists of very deep and well drained soils on volcanic plateaus. Slopes are 2 to 12 percent. These soils formed in a mantel of local alluvium derived from tephra and loess over tephra. Dashiki soils have moderately rapid permeability in the upper part and very rapid permeability in the lower part. The average annual precipitation is about 50 inches. Average annual air temperature is about 34 degrees F.",
