  "OVERVIEW": "The Donna series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to a duripan that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess high in volcanic ash.  Donna soils are on fan piedmont remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
