  "OVERVIEW": "The Dilts series consists of shallow, well drained, slowly or very slowly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from claystone or shale bedrock.  These soils are shallow to shale.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and have slopes ranging from 1 to 60 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 14 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to claystone or shale is less than 20 inches.  The control section is clay or silty clay and averages about 50 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay or silty clay and has moderate or strong granular structure.  It ranges from neutral to medium acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It has weak or moderate blocky or platy structure and is strongly or very strongly acid.  In some pedons few to many yellow and yellowish brown stains are on the surfaces of the plates, along vertical cracks and faces of peds.  The bedrock is strongly or very strongly acid."
