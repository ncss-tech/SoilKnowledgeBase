The control section is clay or silty clay and averages about 50 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay or silty clay and has moderate or strong granular structure.  It ranges from neutral to medium acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It has weak or moderate blocky or platy structure and is strongly or very strongly acid.  In some pedons few to many yellow and yellowish brown stains are on the surfaces of the plates, along vertical cracks and faces of peds.  The bedrock is strongly or very strongly acid."
