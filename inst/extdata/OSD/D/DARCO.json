    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly included in the Lakeland and Troup series. The series was updated in 2002 to allow value 6 in the Bt horizon and to allow clay loam texture below 60 inches deep. The series was updated in 2004 to allow 7.5YR hue in the E and EB horizons.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 117 cm (46 in) (Ap, E1, E2, E3, horizons) - thickness and texture results in Grossarenic subgroup.\nArgillic horizon - the zone from approximately 117 to 218 cm (46 to 86 in) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL data from Type location S74TX-001-1 and TAMU pedon S80TX-405-003.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010 ________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
