  "OVERVIEW": "The Dobel series consists of very shallow and shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Dobel soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
