  "OVERVIEW": "The Dickeypeak series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  The Dickeypeak soils are on fan terraces and stream terraces.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes are 2 to 6 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
