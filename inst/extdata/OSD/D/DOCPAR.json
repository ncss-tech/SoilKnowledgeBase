    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to stratified substrata ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is complex with finer materials overlying coarser, stratified substrata.  When mixed, the texture is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  Prorated clay content ranges from 20 to 30 percent and sand from 35 to 55 percent fine sand or coarser in the control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or  5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam or clay loam with 24 to 35 percent clay.  Rock fragments, mainly small rounded pebbles, range from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam or clay loam with 24 to 35 percent clay.  Rock fragments, mainly small rounded pebbles, range from 0 to 10 percent.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 15 percent, of which about half is pedogenetic.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  This horizon is highly stratified but when averaged is typically a fine sandy loam above a depth of 40 inches with 12 to 20 percent clay.  Rock fragments, mainly rounded pebbles, are variable but range from 0 to 15 percent above 40 inches.  The thin strata are sandy loam, loam, loamy sand, and sand.  The organic carbon content is erratic and decreases irregularly with depth.  EC is less than 4 mmhos.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
