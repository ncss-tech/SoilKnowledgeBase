  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The sola are 28 to 60 inches thick.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 60 inches.  These soils typically lack rock fragments.  However, some pedons have as much as 5 percent of rock fragments of mixed lithology in part to all of the solum or C horizon or both.  Some pedons have an 0 horizon as thick as 4 inches. The mollic epipedon is 24 to 54 inches thick.  The 10- to 40-inch particle-size control section typically averages between 40 and 60 percent clay; however in some pedons material with less clay in the lower part of the control section results in an average between 35 and 40 percent; it has less than 15 percent sand. These soils typically have texture of silty clay or clay throughout the solum, but some pedons have silty clay loam or clay loam in the lower part.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 or 3 or is N 2/0 or N 3/0.  It lacks redoximorphic features in some pedons.  It has dark-colored iron or manganese oxide coatings or concretions in some pedons.  It lacks gypsum crystals in many pedons.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a Bkg horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is typically silty clay or clay, but clay loam or silty clay loam are within a depth of 40 inches in some pedons. In addition, loam or silty loam are below depths of 40 inches in some pedons.   It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  It lacks secondary carbonates in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils have concave slopes with gradient of 0 to 2 percent in depressions and drainageways on ground moraines and glacial lake plains.  They formed in clayey glacial lacustrine sediments, or in clayey till, or in clayey lacustrine sediments over clayey till.  These deposits are Late Wisconsinian in age.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 18 to 26 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Fargo, Nutley, Sinai and Fulda soils which are members of a hydrosequence with the Dovray soils; on large glacial lakes, Dovray may be associated with Bearden soils.  Fargo soils are poorly drained and are on adjacent plane sloping areas.  The Nutley soils are well or moderately well drained and are on convex slopes.  The Sinai soils are moderately well drained and are on plane to slightly concave slopes.  The Fulda soils are poorly drained and are on flats.  Somewhat poorly drained Bearden soils are-fine-silty and have a calcic horizon.   In some places the well drained Hattie and Forman, the moderately well drained Aastad, and the poorly drained Hegne soils are associates.  The Hegne soils have a calcic horizon and developed in materials similar to Dovray.  The Hattie, Forman and Aastad soils formed in glacial till."
