  "OVERVIEW": "The Deneka series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in a thin mantle of volcanic ash influenced loess overlying friable to firm glacial till underlain by igneous or metamorphic bedrock. Deneka soils are on structural benches; and crests and steep backslopes of mountains. Slopes range from 0 to 85 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F.",
