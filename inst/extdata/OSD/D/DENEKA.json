The silty solum ranges in thickness from 11 to 18 inches over glacial till, and may have a buried solum. The upper 10 centimeters of the spodic horizon have more than 6 percent organic carbon. The upper part of the control section formed in loess dominated by amorphous material and has andic properties. Reaction throughout the mineral profile ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe A horizon (where present) has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe E and Eb horizon have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bhs horizons have hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam and loam.\nThe Bs and Bsb horizons have hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is silt loam, fine sandy loam and sandy loam.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is loam or sandy loam modified by 35 to 60 percent total coarse fragments, 15 to 45 percent gravel, 10 to 25 percent cobbles, and 0 to 3 percent stones."
