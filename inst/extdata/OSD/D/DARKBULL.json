  "OVERVIEW": "The Darkbull series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the profile and very rapid in the lower part.  They are on terraces and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 10 inches.",
