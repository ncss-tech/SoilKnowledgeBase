  "OVERVIEW": "The Debute series consists of deep moderately well drained,\nslowly permeable soils that formed in a thin mantle of loess over loamy Southern Coastal Plains sediments.  These soils are on\nnearly level to sloping late Pleistocene age terraces.  Slopes\nrange from 1 to 8 percent.  Water runs off the surface at a medium\nto rapid rate.",
