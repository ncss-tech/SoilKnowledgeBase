  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Delassus series consists of deep and very deep, moderately well drained soils with fragipans formed in loess mixed with slope alluvium and the underlying slope alluvium or residuum from granite and similar rocks of igneous origin. These soils are on wide gently and moderately sloping uplands with slopes ranging from 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.",

Annandale soils have fragipans of gravelly sandy loam and formed in glacial till derived from gneiss. Beltsville soils are semiactive and formed in silty sediments over coastal plain gravelly and sandy sediments.  Califon soils have formed in deeply weathered till or colluvium and rock fragments derived predominantly from granitic gneiss.  Hanover soils have rock fragments dominated by sandstone.  Meckesville soils have hues of 5YR or redder in the fragipan.  Monongahela soils are semiactive and formed in alluvium.  Trego soils have B horizons with more than 40 percent sand.  Tonti soils formed in cherty residuum from limestone.  Watson soils have formed in glacial till and contain rock fragments derived from sandstone and shale."

Irondale and Knobtop soils are associated with fine textured felsitic parent rock and are located at higher elevations and on steeper slopes. In addition, the Irondale soils are very stony and both Knobtop and Irondale soils are moderately deep to hard rock.  Loughboro soils have colors of lower chroma and a clayey subsoil and are on nearly level uplands.  Syenite soils are very bouldery and are on steeper upland side slopes."
