    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Annandale, Beltsville, Califon, Hanover, Meckesville, Monongahela, Tonti, Trego, and Watson series.  Annandale soils have fragipans of gravelly sandy loam and formed in glacial till derived from gneiss. Beltsville soils are semiactive and formed in silty sediments over coastal plain gravelly and sandy sediments.  Califon soils have formed in deeply weathered till or colluvium and rock fragments derived predominantly from granitic gneiss.  Hanover soils have rock fragments dominated by sandstone.  Meckesville soils have hues of 5YR or redder in the fragipan.  Monongahela soils are semiactive and formed in alluvium.  Trego soils have B horizons with more than 40 percent sand.  Tonti soils formed in cherty residuum from limestone.  Watson soils have formed in glacial till and contain rock fragments derived from sandstone and shale."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Delassus soils are on broad smooth to undulating uplands, saddles, and on talus slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  They formed in loess mixed with slope alluvium, and the underlying slope alluvium or residuum weathered from granite or similar igneous rocks.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 47 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Irondale, Knobtop, Loughboro, and Syenite soils.  None of these soils have a fragipan. Irondale and Knobtop soils are associated with fine textured felsitic parent rock and are located at higher elevations and on steeper slopes. In addition, the Irondale soils are very stony and both Knobtop and Irondale soils are moderately deep to hard rock.  Loughboro soils have colors of lower chroma and a clayey subsoil and are on nearly level uplands.  Syenite soils are very bouldery and are on steeper upland side slopes."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: The majority of the area remains in native hardwood forest dominated by upland oaks.  Those areas that are cleared are used for hay, pasture, and row crops.  Fescue, orchard grass, and native grasses are the principal hay and pasture plants and wheat, corn, and grain sorghum are the principal cultivated crops."
