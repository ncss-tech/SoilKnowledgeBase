  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to a horizon containing 5 to 20 percent plinthite ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Base saturation at 50 inches below the top of the Bt horizon ranges from 5 to 25 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value 4 through 6, chroma 2 through 4.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 and 6, chroma of 3 and 4.  Thickness of the combined A and E horizons ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand.  Reaction is medium acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles in shades of red, yellow, and gray are in the lower part of most pedons.  Texture is sandy clay loam.  Plinthite ranges from 5 to 20 percent in the Bty horizon and from 0 to 5 percent in the Bt and Bt' horizons.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Fuquay, Lilbert, Pocalla, and Stilson series in the same family; and the Bonneau, Bowie, Boykin, Briley, Darco, Depcor, Gunter, Larue, Leefield, Letney, Lucy, Pinetucky, Rentzel, Rosalie, Shankler, Troup, Trep, and Wagram series.  Fuquay and Stilson soils have upper Bt horizons with mottles of red and gray, contain less silt and more medium and coarse sand and have low activity clay in the argillic horizon. Lilbert soils are developed in older sediments and are assumed to have different chemical and/or mineralogical properties.  Pocalla soils have bisequal profiles.  Bowie and Pinetucky soils have thinner surface layers that contain less sand.  Bonneau, Boykin, Briley, Letney, Lucy, Rosalie, Trep, and Wagram soils contain less than 5 percent plinthite.  Darco, Gunter, Shankler, and Troup soils have sandy surface layers more than 40 inches thick.  Depcor and Larue soils have a base saturation of more than 35 percent. Leefield and Rentzel soils contain mottles with chromas of 2 or less in the upper Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Doucette soils are on gently sloping to sloping uplands of the West Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  The soils formed in sandy and loamy sediments of Pleistocene Age, mainly of the Willis formation.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 46 to 58 inches.  Summer rainfall ranges from 30 to 40 inches.  Summer moisture deficit ranges from 0 to 4 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 66 degrees to 70 degrees F., and the Thornthwaite annual P-E indices exceed 72."
