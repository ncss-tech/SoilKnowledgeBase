The C horizon is very gravelly and cobbly sandy loam, loamy sand or fine sand containing less than 18 percent  clay and more than 50 percent coarse fragments.  There are few to many voids larger than 1mm. that are not filled with fines in the lower part of the control section.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 40 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at 20 inches is 54 to 58 degrees F.  The A1 horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 1 through 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has weak or moderate fine and medium granular structure.  This horizon is neutral or slightly acid.  The C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is very gravelly and cobbly loamy fine sand, fine sand or sandy loam and contains over 50 percent coarse fragments.  This horizon is neutral and slightly acid."

These soils formed in colluvium derived from mixed sedimentary and metamorphic parent rocks.  The climate is humid with 23 to 35 inches precipitation falling mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is about 57 degrees F."

Cluff soils have a mollic epipedon 6 to 9 inches thick overlying the A2 horizon and have fine textured argillic horizons with more than 35 percent clay.  Fitzgerald soils lack mollic epipedons and have albic and argillic horizons.  Roundy soils have A2 horizons underlain by fine textured argillic horizons that have less than 35 percent coarse fragments and more than 35 percent clay."
