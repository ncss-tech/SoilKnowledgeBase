  "OVERVIEW": "The Dawny series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvial and eolian material derived primarily from noncalcareous sandstone.  Dawny soils are on relict eolian surfaces, upland valley fills, and in basins.  Slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Dawny soils are typically noncalcareous, but some pedons contain few fine masses of calcium carbonate below 50 inches.  Depth to the base of the mollic epipedon ranges from 25 to 38 inches.  Bedrock is deeper than 60 inches.  Coarse fragments are typically less than 5 percent but range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F., which occurs about April 20-27, but is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days from July 15 to October 25 and for at least 90 cumulative days during this period.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is neutral or slightly acid.\nAn AB or BA horizon is present in most pedons.  It has the same range in characteristics as the A horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Textures are fine sandy loam or sandy loam with 10 to 18 percent clay and 60 to 75 percent fine and coarser sand.  Structure is typically subangular blocky or prismatic.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Textures are loamy sand, loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, or fine sandy loam with less than 15 percent clay.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline."

The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 17 inches, half of which falls as rain and snow in April, May, and June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 43 to 49 degrees F.

Jayem and Vetal soils lack argillic horizons.  Also, Jayem soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick."
