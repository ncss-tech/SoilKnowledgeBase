  "OVERVIEW": "The Dunsmuir series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from medisedimentary and ultramafic rocks on hills and mountains.  The average annual precipitation is 55 inches and the mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent.",

The profile between depths of 6 and 18 inches is dry in all parts from June to October and is moist in all parts from December to May. The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 59 degrees F. The ratio of gibbsite plus extractable iron oxide to clay is 0.2 or more. The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon averages 30 to 35 percent clay. The profile is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has color of 1 OYR 3/4, of 7.5YR 4/6, 5/6, or 5/8, or of 5YR 4/4, 4/6, or 5/6. It has moist color of 5YR 3/4 or 4/4 or of 2.5YR 3/6. It is 20 to 27 percent clay and 5 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe Bt horizon has color of 7.5YR 5/6 or 5/8, 5YR 4/6, or 2.5YR 4/6. It has moist color of 5YR 5/8 or of 2.5YR 3/4, 3/6, 4/6, or 5/6. It is clay loam or gravelly clay loam and is 30 to 40 percent clay, 5 to 20 percent gravel, and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nIn some areas there is a BCt or Ct horizon. Colors and textures of the BCt or Ct horizon are the same as those of the Bt horizon. Variegated moist color of 1 OYR 4/3 or 7/3 or of 7.5YR 4/4 or 5/8 is present in the A, Bt, or Ct horizon in some areas."
