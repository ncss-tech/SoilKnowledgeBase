Blackmagic, Jagerson and Poachie soils are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30) and receive most of the precipitation in the winter. Mohave soils are in the Sonoran Desert and Sonoran-Chihuahuan transition (MLRAs 40 & 41) and have a bi-modal precipitation pattern. Cornville soils are not calcareous throughout.  Hap and Tres Hermanos soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. Mohave soils have less than 45 percent sand in the Bt horizons and have calcic horizons at depths greater than 20 inches.  Madurez soils have calcic horizons at depths greater than 20 inches.  Jagerson, and Kidwell soils are moist in the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative during July-September."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dona Ana soils are on alluvial fans and fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  The soils formed in sediments derived principally from limestone, calcareous sandstone, siltstone, shale, and small amounts of granite, monzonite, rhyolite, quartzite, and andesite.  Elevation is 3,600 to 5,830 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 to 12 inches with a marked summer maximum.  The mean annual air temperature is about 58 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 days to 240 days."
