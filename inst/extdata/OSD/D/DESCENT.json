  "OVERVIEW": "The Descent series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from granitoid and gneiss. Descent soils are on ballenas and fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).",

In addition, Carrwash soils have more than 50 percent of the rock fragments in the particle-size control section in the 2 to 5 millimeter range and Rizzo soils have a dryer climate, typical of the Lower Colorado Desert, with a moisture control section that is usually dry, and only moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring."

Carrizo and Rizzo are competing soils but have a calcium carbonate equivalent of less than 5 percent in the particle-size control section. Deprave, Oldale and Roostertail soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections and an argillic horizon. In addition, Deprave soils have a duripan within 50 centimeters of the surface and Roostertail soils have a duripan below 100 centimeters."
