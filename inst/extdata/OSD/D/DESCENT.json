  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Carrwash (NV), Carrizo (CA+AZ) and Rizzo (CA) series. All of these soils have calcium carbonate equivalents (CCE) of less than 5 percent in the control section and do not have rock fragments which are dominantly channers and flagstones. In addition, Carrwash soils have more than 50 percent of the rock fragments in the particle-size control section in the 2 to 5 millimeter range and Rizzo soils have a dryer climate, typical of the Lower Colorado Desert, with a moisture control section that is usually dry, and only moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring."

Elevations range from 150 to 660 meters (492 to 2,165 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."

Blackeagle soils are on adjacent mountain backslopes, have a cambic horizon and are shallow to bedrock. Carrizo, Deprave, Oldale, Rizzo and Roostertail soils are on adjacent fan aprons and fan remnants. Carrizo and Rizzo are competing soils but have a calcium carbonate equivalent of less than 5 percent in the particle-size control section. Deprave, Oldale and Roostertail soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections and an argillic horizon. In addition, Deprave soils have a duripan within 50 centimeters of the surface and Roostertail soils have a duripan below 100 centimeters."
