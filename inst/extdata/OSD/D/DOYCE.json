  "OVERVIEW": "The Doyce series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium derived from sedimentary and igneous rocks on fan terraces.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone of dark colored soil material from the surface to a depth of 10 inches. (A1, A2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone of clay accumulation from a depth of 10 to 20 inches. (Bt and Btk horizons)\nCalcic horizon -the zone from 20 to 44 inches.  (Bk horizons)\nThese soils were reclassified from Aridic Calcic Argixerolls to Calcic Argixerolls in 9/94 based on a 12 to 14 inch precipitation and upland range site.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated."
