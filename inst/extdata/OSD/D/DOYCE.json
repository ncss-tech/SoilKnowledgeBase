(A1, A2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone of clay accumulation from a depth of 10 to 20 inches. (Bt and Btk horizons)\nCalcic horizon -the zone from 20 to 44 inches.  (Bk horizons)\nThese soils were reclassified from Aridic Calcic Argixerolls to Calcic Argixerolls in 9/94 based on a 12 to 14 inch precipitation and upland range site.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
