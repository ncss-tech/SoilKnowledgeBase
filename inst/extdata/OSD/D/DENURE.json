These soils formed in alluvium from acid and basic igneous rock and eolian deposits. Elevation is 500 to 2,200 feet (152 to 671 meters). The climate is hot, arid continental. The mean annual precipitation is 2 to 10 inches (51 to 254 mm) occurring as gentle winter rains and erratic high intensity summer thunderstorms. The mean annual air temperature is 68 to 74 degrees F (20 to 23.3 degrees C). The frost-free period is 240 to 325 days."

The present type location better typifies the concept of the series and the distinction between it and the competing Dateland series.
