  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Depalt series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous clayey terrestrial sediments of Lower Cretaceous age.  These soils occupy nearly level to gently sloping uplands.  Slopes are dominantly 0 to 2 percent but range to 3 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to 80 inches.  The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 40 to 60 percent.  When dry, cracks 1/2 to more than 1 inch wide extend from the surface to a depth of more than 12 inches.  Cracks remain open from 90 to 150 cumulative days in most years.  Slickensides and wedge-shaped peds begin at a depth of 6 to 24 inches.  Gilgai microrelief is indistinct but slickensides are common below 6 inches.  Coarse fragments chert and limestone pebbles range from few to 15 percent by volume in the upper Bss and 10 to 40 percent in the lower part of the Bk horizon.\nThe Bss and Bk horizon have colors mainly in shades of gray, brown, or red with hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6 , and chroma of 2 to 6.  Clay content in the 10 to 40 inch control section is 40 to 60 percent.  Texture of the B horizons is dominantly clay or silty clay.  In some pedons below 24 inches, it is silty clay loam or clay loam or their gravelly counterparts.  Some pedons contain horizons that are very gravelly and 2 to 6 inches thick.  Fragments are mostly chert but include some limestone.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nWeakly consolidated to cemented and weathered or indurated limestone occurs in some pedons at depths below 60 inches."

Frelsburg, Ferris, Latium and Medlin soils have hue of 10YR or grayer throughout and are calcareous in the surface layers.  Crawford series has sola less than 40 inches thick over limestone.  Heiden, Luling, Ovan, and Sanger soils have dominant hue of 10YR or grayer throughout.  Tamford soils occur over clayey Permian sediments and occur in areas where the mean temperature is less than 65 degrees F."
