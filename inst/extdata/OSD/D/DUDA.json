  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 12 to 24 inches and the depth to sandstone bedrock typically is about 25 inches, but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Carbonates are leached to the bedrock.   Small sandstone fragments are throughout some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or sandy loam. It is slightly acid or neutral.  Some pedons have light colored fine sand surface horizons where winnowing has removed the fines and organic matter.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loamy fine sand or loamy sand and is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or fine sand and ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  The C horizon contains 2 to 15 percent by volume sandstone fragments; however, the boundary between the C and Cr horizons typically is clear or abrupt.\nThe Cr horizon typically is moderately cemented sandstone; however, in some pedons it is weakly cemented with few, moderately cemented or strongly cemented sandstone fragments.  The sandstone is not always continuous in respect to depth, and loose sand underlies the sandstone in some pedons."

Valentine soils typically are on higher convex landscapes.  Anselmo, Doger, and Dunday soils do not have bedrock within depths of 40 inches, have mollic epipedons, and are on similar landscapes. Holt and Ronson soils are coarse-loamy, and are on nearly level and gently undulating tablelands.  Tassel soils have loamy textures and sandstone bedrock at shallow depths and are on crests and shoulders within the landscape.  Vetal soils have mollic epipedons, are coarse-loamy, and are in upland swales."
