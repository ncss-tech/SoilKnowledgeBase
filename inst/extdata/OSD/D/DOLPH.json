  "OVERVIEW": "The Dolph series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess and the underlying clayey residuum weathered from micaceous schist.  These upland soils have slow permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 45 inches.  Silty mantle is less than 30 inches thick.  The A horizon ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.  The B horizon is extremely acid to strongly acid.  The C horizon is strongly acid to slightly acid.  The upper silty mantle does not have coarse fragments.  Volume of pebbles in the residuum (lower part of solum and in the substratum range from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe Ap or A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Where present, the A horizon is 3 to 5 inches thick.\nThe E horizon has 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR hue; value of 4 through 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Mottles are few to many and distinct to prominent.\nDolph soils have E/B or B/E horizons, or both.  They have tongues of E material surrounding thin, columnlike upward extensions of the Bt horizon or wholly surrounding small, isolated remnants of the Bt horizon.  The tongues have characteristics like the E horizon.  The Bt part has 5YR, 2.5YR, or 10R hue; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has 5YR, 2.5YR, or 10R hue; value of 3 through 5; and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Clay films are faint and common to continuous on faces of peds as well as in tubular pores.  The control section averages between 35 and 55 percent clay and from 10 to 35 percent fine sand or coarser.\nWhere present, the 2BC horizon has textures, colors, reaction ranges, and structure intermediate between the 2Bt horizon and the 2C horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y hue; value of 3 through 6; chroma of 2 through 8, but hue ranges to 10R immediately below the 2BC horizon where present.  Mottles are few to many and distinct to prominent.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand, but the range includes silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam in the upper part."

The Dolph soils formed in a loess mantle less than 30 inches thick and in the underlying clayey residuum weathered from micaceous schist.  A paralithic contact is at a depth of 40 to more than 60 inches.  Mean annual temperature is estimated to range from 43 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches."
