    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 18 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 20 feet.  Coarse fragments of rounded quartz gravels ranges from 1 to 15 percent in the solum and from 0 to 10 percent in the C horizon.  Reaction is strongly to very strongly acid unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4 and chroma of 0 through 2.  It is sandy loam or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 6 through 8.  It is sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.  The BC horizons are similar to the Bt and C horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Higher chroma mottles and streaks are common.  Thin lenses up to 3 inches thick of silty clay are common in the C horizon.  Content of feldspar sand ranges from about 25 to 60 percent in the C horizon.  It is loamy sand to sandy loam."

The Athol, Carpenter, Door, Hayter and Westmoreland soils have sandstone and shale coarse fragments.  The Bolton, and Morrison soils have chert rock fragments.  The Duffield soils have more silt than the Dumfries.  The Bookwood, Culleoka, Frondorf, Loudonville, Penn and Ryder soils have bedrock betweem 20 and 40 inches. The Brecknock soils have bedrock from 40 to 60 inches.  The Dormont, Myersville, Neshaminy and Washington soils have hue redder than 7.5 YR.  The Grayford and Lamotte soils have a loess capping.  The Legore soils have diabase and diorite rock fragments.  The Sudley soils are weathered from Triassic-Jurassic sandstone and conglomerate and have rock fragments of these in the solum.  The Wheeling soils are on river terraces and underlain with sand or sand and grave.  The Williamsburg soils have a solum more than 60 inches thick."

These soils developed in sandy feldspathic sediments in highly dissected Coastal Plain terraces.  Slope ranges from 2 to 55 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 42 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 59 degrees F."
