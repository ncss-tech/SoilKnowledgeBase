    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 39 to 42 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 54 to 56 degrees F.  Content of rock fragments in the particle-size control section range from 35 to 65 percent by volume.  Depth to top of the argillic horizon ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  Clay content of the argillic horizon ranges from 28 to 35 percent.  Some pedons do not have an A&B horizon.\nThe A1 horizons have a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 to 3.  Typically, it is a loam, but is a cobbly loam in some pedons.  It contains 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobble.\nThe A2 horizon has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is a very gravelly loam, very gravelly fine sandy loam or cobbly loam.  It contains 10 to 25 percent gravel, 10 to 15 percent cobble and 0 to 5 percent stones by volume.\nThe B2 horizon has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It is a very cobbly clay loam, or very stony clay loam.  It contains 20 to 35 percent gravel, 10 to 20 percent cobble, and 5 to 15 percent stones by volume."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Lucky Star, Nordic, (T)Norway Flat, and Schuster series.  The Lucky Star soils have a more acid soil reaction and redder hues in the Bt horizon.  Nordic soils are more acid in reaction, lack both A&B horizons, and B&A horizons, an have an A2 horizon that is 19 to 28 inches thick.  The (T)Norway Flat soils have less than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon and have A&B horizons below a depth of 40 inches.  The Schuster soils have hues of 5YR or 2.5YR in the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dunckley soils are on mountainside slopes at elevations of 7,200 to 8,500 feet.  Slopes range from 25 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium derived from sandstone.  Mean annual temperature is 37 to 40 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 22 inches.  The frost-free season is about 40 to 65 days."

Skyway soils are coarse-loamy and have a thicker mollic epipedon with a lithic contact between a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Splitro is shallow to a lithic contact.  Winevada soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections, a thicker mollic epipedon, and have a lithic contact between a depth of 20 and 40 inches."
