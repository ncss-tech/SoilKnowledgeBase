  "OVERVIEW": "The Dunckley series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from sandstone.  These soils are on mountain side slopes and have slopes ranging from 25 to 65 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm.",
