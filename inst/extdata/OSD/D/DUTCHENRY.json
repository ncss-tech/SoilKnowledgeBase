    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The average annual soil temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. These soils are usually moist in the moisture control section but are dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 25 inches thick. The particle-size contral section has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.05 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, 15 to 30 percent sand-size pumice 0.5 to 2.0mm in diameter and 0 to 10 percent rock fragments, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples and an apparent field estimate of 4 to 10 percent clay. Base saturation is less than 75 percent in some subhorizons within 30 inches of the surface. Depth to the indurated duripan is 20 to 40 inches. Basalt bedrock underlies the indurated duripan at 30 to 60 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, chroma of 2 or 3 dry and 1 or 2 moist.\nThe A1 horizon reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe A2 horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist. Texture is ashy fine sandy loam, ashy loam, or ashy silt loam. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist. Texture is ashy fine sandy loam, ashy loam, or ashy silt loam. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 1 to 10 percent. Reaction is slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bkqm horizon has value of 6, 7, or 8 dry and 5, 6, 7, or 8 moist, and chroma of 1, 2, or 3 dry and 2, 3, or 4 moist. The indurated duripan is cemented with silica and calcium carbonate, is 4 to 24 inches thick, and is fractured with average duripan plates measuring 4 to 14 inches in width and 1 to 4 inches in thickness. The duripan is directly underlain by basalt bedrock in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dutchenry soils are on nonglaciated plateaus. Elevation is 2,400 to 3,200 feet. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Dutchenry soils formed in mixed loess and volcanic ash primarily from the G and B eruptions of Glacier Peak 12,750 to 11,250 years ago over indurated lime-silica duripan. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches. Average January air temperature is 26 degrees F., average July air temperature is 70 degrees F., and average annual air temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F. Frost-free season is 110 to 165 days."

Dougville soils are on sideslopes and toeslopes and have an argillic horizon. Farmer soils are on uplands and have an argillic horizon. Norax soils are on eroded uplands, have an argillic horizon, and do not have a mollic epipedon. Sevar soils are on sideslopes and have an argillic horizon. Silico soils are on sideslopes and toeslopes and are shallow to indurated duripan."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this pedon are a mollic epipedon from 0 to 24 inches and a Bk horizon from 24 to 33 inches with 6 percent calcium carbonate equivalent over a indurated lime-silica duripan. The soil from the surface to 33 inches has 10 to 30 percent pumice and 30 to 60 percent volcanic glass. The particle control section is the zone from 10 to 33 inches (part of the AB1, and the AB2 and Bk horizons). The pumice is white, gray, or yellowish brown.\nADDITIONAL DATA:. The calcium carbonate equivalent test done on the Bk horizon was run in the survey office using a standard calcimeter.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
