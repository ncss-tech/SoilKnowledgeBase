  "OVERVIEW": "The Doubledia series consists of deep, well drained soils with very slow permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from lacustrine deposits. Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent in foothills and valleys. The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
