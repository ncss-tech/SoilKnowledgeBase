  "OVERVIEW": "The Domerie series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in phyllite and schist with an admixture of volcanic ash in the upper horizons.  Domerie soils are on mountain sides at elevations of 3,600 to 5,800 feet.  Slopes are 30 to 70 percent.  The average annual precipitation  is about 60 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
