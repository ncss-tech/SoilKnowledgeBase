The soils are usually moist and are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days during summer and fall. The particle-size control section has by volume 40 to 70 percent angular channers and flagstones.  It has acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.7 to 2.8 percent, volcanic glass content of 30 to 70 percent, 15-bar moisture of 5 to 12 percent, phosphate retention of 40 to 80 percent, and an estimated moist bulk density of 0.85 to 1.10 g/cc.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has a value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and 2 through 4 moist.\nThe Bw1 horizon has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is ashy loam or ashy sandy loam with 20 to 40 percent phyllite and schist fragment.\nThe Bw2, Bw3, and Bw4 horizons have value of 6 or 7, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 4 to 6 dry or moist.

These soils developed from residuum and colluvium from phyllite and schist with an admixture of volcanic ash.  They are in  a climate with cool moist summers and cool moderately wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 50 to 70 inches.  The average January temperature is about 24 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 62 degrees F.  The average annual temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F. and frost-free season is 35 to 80 days  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 130 to 170 days."
