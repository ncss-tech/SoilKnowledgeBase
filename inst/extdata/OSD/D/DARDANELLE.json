Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the A and BA horizons; strongly acid to neutral in the B horizon; moderately acid to mildly alkaline in the BC horizon and strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the C horizon.  In some pedons, the C horizon is calcareous.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3, or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2, or hue of 5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3, or hue 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2, or hue of 5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.

Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Although not diagnostic, dark colored ped coatings are present in the Bt2 and Bt3 horizons of most pedons.  The clay content ranges from 20 to 35 percent with less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. Some pedons have high chroma mottles below 30 inches.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 3 or 4, or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2 or 4, or hue of 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.
