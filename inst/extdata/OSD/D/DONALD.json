  "OVERVIEW": "The Donald series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on fan remnants, alluvial fans, stream terraces, hills and mountain slopes. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
