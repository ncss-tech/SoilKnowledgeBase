The soils are usually moist and are dry in all parts between the depths of 4 to 12 inches for 100 to 115 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The soils are moist in winter.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to the duripan is 20 to 40 inches and depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.\nThe Ap and A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.  It is loam and has 0 to 20 percent gravel.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and moist.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay.  It has 0 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe 2Cqm horizon is indurated with 1 to 2 mm thick laminar bands or is strongly cemented and indurated in the upper part.  The lower part is weakly cemented in some pedons and contains up to 25 percent gravel.  Thin seams of lime-silica occur in some pedons.  Some pedons have a 2Bqm horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has a hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 or 5 moist, chroma 2 to 8 moist or dry.  It is very gravelly loam or very gravelly sandy loam and contains 25 to 55 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles."

These soils formed in lacustrine deposits and alluvium of Pleistocene age derived from basalt, andesite, and some pyroclastic rocks.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  The frost-free period is 70 to 110 days."
