  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to bedrock range from 20 to 40 inches.  Flat, subangular or angular, sandstone fragments, 1 to 10 inches across increase with depth and range from 10 to 60 percent in individual horizons of the solum and from 50 to 90 percent or more in the C horizon.  The amount of rock fragments typically increases with depth.  Weighted average rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 75 percent in the particle-size control section.  Cobbly, channery, and very stony phases are common.  Reaction ranges from extremely through strongly acid where unlimed.  Illite, kaolinite, and vermiculite are common clay minerals.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. If cultivated, an Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Structure is weak very fine or fine granular.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture and structure are similar to the A horizon.\nSome pedons have a BA horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Average clay content typically is between 6 to 15 percent but ranges up to 18 percent in the particle-size control section.  Structure is weak to moderate, fine or coarse subangular blocky.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8 and chroma of 4 to 8. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine- earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is sandy loam or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction.  Bedrock is gray to brown sandstone of varying hardness and is commonly fractured without displacement."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Hazleton and Wallen soils are in the same family. Hazleton soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock.  Wallen soils allow more silt textures in the solum.\nThe Hailey, Lehew and soils are in related families.  Hailey soils formed in residuum from cherty limestone. Lehew soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the B horizon.  Marbleyard soils have rock fragments dominantly of quartzite and metasandstone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dekalb soils are on nearly level to very steep, uplands and ridges.  Slopes are usually convex with gradients of 0 to 80 percent.  The regolith weathered from gray and brown acid sandstone in places interbedded with shale and graywacke.  The climate is humid temperate with mean annual rainfall of 36 to 60 inches and mean annual air temperature of 47 to 59 degrees F.  The growing season ranges from 110 to 180 days."
