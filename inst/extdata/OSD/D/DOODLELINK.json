Gimlett soils contain less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Lamondi soils are slightly acid or medium acid.  Moweba soils have 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR hues in the B horizon.  Piersonte soils have O horizons and rock fragments of shale.  Scoap soils have 8 to 12 percent clay in the control section.  Umatilla soils have O horizons and have a dominance of cobbles in the particle-size control section."

The soils formed in colluvium and slope alluvium weathered from extrusive igneous rocks and volcanic ash.  Elevations are 1,433 to 2,195 meters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 360 to 500 mm.  The average annual air temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 60 to 100 days."

Amboat soils are clayey-skeletal.  Brose soils are shallow.   Congle soils occur on the same landscape, but are not skeletal.  Nawt and Stricker soils occur on the same landscape, but at lower elevations, are mesic, and are not Pachic.  Oshone soils occur on terraces, are fine and moderately deep to a hardpan.  Tucker soils occur on terraces, are fine and somewhat poorly drained."
