  "OVERVIEW": "The Doodlelink series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from extrusive igneous rocks and volcanic ash. They are on mountainsides and breaks.  Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 400 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

Nawt and Stricker soils occur on the same landscape, but at lower elevations, are mesic, and are not Pachic.  Oshone soils occur on terraces, are fine and moderately deep to a hardpan.  Tucker soils occur on terraces, are fine and somewhat poorly drained."
