Dekoven, Kings, Montgomery, and Titus soils are other closely related families.  Dekoven soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Kings and Titus soils have smectitic mineralogy.  Montgomery soils have organic matter content that decreases regularly with depth and are calcareous below a depth of 26 and 48 inches."
