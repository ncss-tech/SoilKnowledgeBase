  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 5 to 30 inches.  Depth to continuous genetic horizons if visible secondary calcium carbonate ranges from 12 to 35 inches.  The control section is usually loam or clay loam, but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 10 to 55 percent and sand from 15 to 65 percent with less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in a major part of the control section and are mainly 10 to 24 inches in diameter.  Sand and silt fractions contain 2 to 20 percent or more dark ferromagnesian rich minerals and fragments of basalt, and rock fragments are mainly basalt stones.  The A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.  The B2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is neutral or moderately alkaline.  The C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline, and has 3 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Capps, Chugter, Fishers, Ortiz and Shirk series.  Capps soils have 20 to 60 percent calcium carbonate in the Cca horizon.  Chugter soils have hue of 5YR or redder.  Fishers soils are noncalcareous to depths of more than 40 inches and lack horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation.  Ortiz and Shirk soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Deacon soils are on alluvial fans and valley sideslopes.  Slopes typically range from about 2 to 40 percent.  The soils formed in thick, calcareous, medium to moderately fine textured materials weathered from igneous and sedimentary rocks.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches with nearly equal precipitation in all months.  Mean annual temperature is 46 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 66 degrees F."
