  "OVERVIEW": "The Dosie series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from andesite and basalt.  Dosie soils are on plateaus and mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
