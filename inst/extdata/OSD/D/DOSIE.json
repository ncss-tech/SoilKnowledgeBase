    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dosie soils are on plateaus and mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from andesite and basalt.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,500 to 2,200 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 65 to 90 days."
