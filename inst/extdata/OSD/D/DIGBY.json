  "OVERVIEW": "The Digby series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy outwash overlying gravelly, loamy and sandy outwash deposits. They are on terraces and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",

Angola, Mitiwanga, Nuhi, and Shadeland soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Appleton soils are not stratified in the lower part of the series control section. Ayrshire and Whitaker soils average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Burdett and Darien soils have rock fragments dominated by shale within the series control section. Crawleyville and Mongle soils are more acid than slightly alkaline in the lower part of the series control section. Ovid soils have hue redder than 10YR in the argillic horizon. Sleeth soils do not have subhorizons in the lower part of the series control section with less than 85 percent sand and are commonly more than 112 cm (44 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon."

The till substratum phase has till (with 27 to 42 percent clay) within a depth of 71 to 122 cm (28 to 48 inches). These phases will need to be evaluated during MLRA update activities.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 36 cm (Ap, BEg horizons).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 36 to 112 cm (Btg, Bt, B'tg horizons).\nAquic conditions: redox features in all horizons below a depth of 20 cm."
