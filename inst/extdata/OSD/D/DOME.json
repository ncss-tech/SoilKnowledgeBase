  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact of weathered granitic rock ranges from 40 to greater than 60 inches.  The soil between depths of about 8 to 24 inches usually becomes moist in all parts in late October or November and remains moist until mid-May or June.  The soil is dry in all parts the rest of the year.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 30 percent by volume.  Rock fragments on glacial outwash positions are gravelly in the surface horizons becoming cobbly with depth.  When this soil is forming in place the cobbly textures are not evident.  Texture of the control section is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam or loamy coarse sand with less than 18 percent clay.  Base saturation is assumed to be less than 60 percent in all parts between 10 and 30 inches.  Mollic colors do not extend below a depth of 9 inches.\nThe A horizon has a color value of 4 to 6 dry, 3, 4, 5 or 6 moist, and chromas of 2 to 4 in hue of 10YR and 7.5YR.  It has a weak medium or coarse subangular blocky to moderate fine or medium granular structure.  Reaction is slightly acid or medium acid.\nThe Bw horizon has a dry color value of 5, 6 or 7, and chromas of 3 through 8 in hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 2.5YR.  Moist colors are 10YR, 5YR or 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6, 5/8, 6/4, 6/6 or 6/8.  It has moderate fine or medium subangular blocky structure.  Reaction is medium or strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has a color value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chromas of 3 through 5 in hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR.  It has weak subangular blocky structure, or is massive.  The Cr material grades into hard granitic rock at varying depths.  Reaction is medium or strongly acid."

Chaix, Loper, and Elwha soils are all 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Gilligan soils have silt loam or very fine sandy loam in the control section and have less than 15 percent rock fragments.  Tethrick soils are only dry for 60 to 80 days following the summer solstice.  Ulricher soils have mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 50 degrees F.  In addition they formed from metamorphic rock and are influenced by volcanic material."

The soils formed in material weathered from Mesozoic granitic rock, principally granodiorite.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and warm dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 24 to 60 inches, mean annual air temperature varies from 46 degrees to 50 degrees F, and the frost-free season is about 125 to 225 days."
