  "OVERVIEW": "The Delight series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey marine sediments overlying calcareous claystone or marl. They are on concave upland slopes on interfluves of the Cretaceous Western Gulf Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area. Near the type location, the average annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F) and the average annual precipitation is 1219 to 1600 mm (48 to 63 in). Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.",
