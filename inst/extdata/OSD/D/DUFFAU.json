  "OVERVIEW": "The Duffau series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy residuum weathered from sandstone and siltstone.  These nearly level to moderately sloping soils occur on footslopes and backslopes of ridges on hills. Slope are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).",
