  "OVERVIEW": "The Devine series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy sediments mixed with  thick beds of Uvalde Gravel of Quaternary age. These nearly level to strongly sloping soils are on high stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 711 mm (28 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 20.5 degrees C (69 degrees F).",
