  "OVERVIEW": "The Dorper series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Dorper soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
