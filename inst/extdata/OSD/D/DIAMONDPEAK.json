  "OVERVIEW": "The Diamondpeak series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in tephra and colluvium over residuum from hydrothermally altered rocks. Diamondpeak soils are on mountain side slopes in hydrothermally altered areas in the Southern Cascade mountains. Slopes range from 10 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 117 inches (2972 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F (4 degrees C).",
