  "OVERVIEW": "The Dalecreek series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from granite.  These soils are on flood plains, valley fills, and alluvial terraces in mountainous areas.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 17 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F.",

Depth to the seasonal high water table ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 67 degrees F.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.  EC ranges from 0 to 4 mmhos.  Clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 18 to 35 percent but is usually 20 to 25 percent.  Content of coarse fragments in the particle-size control section averages 0 to 30 percent.  Coarse fragments are dominantly fine angular granitic pebbles with 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Texture typically is loam, sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam modified with 5 to 15 percent fine angular gravel.\nThe Bw horizon ,when present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Texture typically is loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam with 18 to 25 percent clay.  Texture is modified with 0 to 30 percent fine angular gravel.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Texture is typically sandy clay loam or loam modified with 0 to 30 percent fine angular gravel and stratified with thin lenses of fine sandy loam, sandy loam, and loamy coarse sand."
