    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ashburn, Blocher, Gallipolis, Jeneva, Percell, Stonehead, Tarhollow and Westgate series. Ashburn, Blocher, Gallipolis and Percell soils do not have a paralithic contact in the series control section. Jeneva soils average less than 40 percent clay in the 2Bt horizon.  Stonehead soils average less than 8 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section (2BC horizon). Tarhollow soils compete very closely with Deuchars soils, but do not have pararock fragments in the series control section. Westgate soils have at least one subhorizon with dominant hue of 5YR or redder in the 2Bt horizon and formed in residuum dominantly from calcareous shale with interbedded limestone and siltstone."

They formed in loess or silty slope alluvium and the underlying residuum from shale that can be interbedded with thin beds of sandstone or siltstone. Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Frost-free days range from 170 to 200."

The moderately deep, less clayey Adyeville soils are on similar landform positions. The moderately well drained Apalona soils have a fragipan, and are on summits and shoulders of hills. The deep or very deep, moderately well drained Ebal and moderately deep Kitterman soils are backslopes of hills. The deep, well drained Wellston soils are on similar landforms."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) in the upper part of the solum and moderately low or moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers/s) in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow in the lower part. The potential for surface water runoff is high. An intermittent, perched high water table is at 61 to 91 centimeters (2.0 to 3.0 feet) from December to April in most years."
