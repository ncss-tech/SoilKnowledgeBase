  "OVERVIEW": "The Deuchars series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess or silty slope alluvium and the underlying residuum from shale interbedded with thin beds of sandstone and siltstone. These soils are on hills. Slopes range from 6 to 24 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
