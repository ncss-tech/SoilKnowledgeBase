  "OVERVIEW": "The Domell series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in lahar or mudflow material with a high content of volcanic ash and pumiceous cinders.  They are on convex glaciated mountain slopes at elevations of l,800 to 2,800 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 80 inches and average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Landforms associated with Domell soils show evidence of rounding and sculpting by alpine glaciation.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in lahar or mud flow material with a high content of volcanic ash and pumice.  The lahar is overlain by a mantle of aerially deposited volcanic ash and pumice fragments.  Domell soils are underlain by ablation and weakly cemented basal till at depths greater than 60 inches.  The climate is characterized by cool dry summers and cool wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 70 to 90 inches.  Average annual air temperature is 42  to 44  F.   The growing season (28  F.) is 160 to 180 days."
