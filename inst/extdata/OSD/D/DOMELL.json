Pebble size pumice fragments which are heavily weathered (soft) range from 5 to 30 percent throughout the profile.  The control section has less than 18 percent clay by apparent field texture.  Domell soils are underlain by alpine ablation and basal till at depths of 50 to 60 inches in some pedons.  The soil ranges from slightly acid to moderately acid throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Hard pebbles range from 5 to 10 percent.\nThe Bw1 horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry.  It is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.   Hard pebbles range from 5 to 20 percent and cobbles from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe Bw2 and Bw3 or BC horizons have value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.

Murtip soils have apparent 18 to 24 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Tolany soils lack pumice fragments in the particle-size control section.  Larchmount and Lempira soils have an umbric epipedon more than 20 inches thick and have more than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Murtip soils are strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout.  Volash soils have a xeric moisture regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Domell soils are on convex mountain slopes, benches, and ridgetops of the central Cascades in southeastern Lewis County, Washington.  Landforms associated with Domell soils show evidence of rounding and sculpting by alpine glaciation.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in lahar or mud flow material with a high content of volcanic ash and pumice.  The lahar is overlain by a mantle of aerially deposited volcanic ash and pumice fragments.  Domell soils are underlain by ablation and weakly cemented basal till at depths greater than 60 inches.  The climate is characterized by cool dry summers and cool wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 70 to 90 inches.  Average annual air temperature is 42  to 44  F.   The growing season (28  F.) is 160 to 180 days."
