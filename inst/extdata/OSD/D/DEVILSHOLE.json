  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Devilshole soils are on convex positions on summits and shoulders of predominantly southeast to southwest-facing ridges and mountain slopes. Slopes are 5 to 50 percent. Elevations are 60 to 1000 meters. These soils formed in residuum from mudstone and sandstone. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers with a marine layer influence and cool wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1525 to 3050 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 13 to 15 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 280 days."
