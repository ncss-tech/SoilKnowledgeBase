  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The Combined thickness of the A1, B1, and B2t horizons ranges from 30 to 40 inches.  Gravel and cobbles are present throughout the profile and generally increase with depth.  The rock fragments range from 30 to 50 percent by volume in the A1 horizon, 40 to 60 percent in the B1 horizon, and 50 to 80 percent in the B2t horizon, and 70 to  95 percent in the C horizon.  The mean soil temperature ranges from about 42 to 46 degrees F., and the mean annual soil temperature at the 20 inch depth ranges from 60 to 65 degrees F.  The soils are moist 55 to 65 percent of the time, but are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days in the 8 to 24 inch depth in the summer and early autumn.  The A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has weak or moderate medium granular structure.  This horizon is slightly acid or neutral.  The B1 horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is very cobbly heavy clay loam or cobbly clay loam.  This horizon has weak to moderate, medium subangular blocky or weak medium prismatic structure.  The B2t horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  (The values of 3 moist occur only in the upper portion of the horizon within 18 inches of the surface.)  It is dominantly very cobbly clay, but ranges to very cobbly heavy clay loam with more than 35 percent clay.  It has moderate medium to fine prismatic structure that  parts to moderate medium or fine subangular blocky structure.  This horizon has thin to moderately thick continuous clay films on faces of peds.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  The Cca horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 or 5.  It is very cobbly clay loam or very cobbly loam.  This horizon is mildly to strongly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ant Flat, Hoskins, Rucklick, Sheep Creek, and Yeates Hollow series.  Ant Flat soils have clay argillic horizons that contain little or no gravel or cobbles.  Hoskin soils have very cobbly heavy loam or light clay loam argillic horizons with less than 35 percent clay and lack horizons of lime accumulation.  Rucklick soils have a mean annual temperature with less than 35 percent clay.  Yeates Hollow soils lack horizons of lime accumulation."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Datwyler soils are at elevations of 5,000 to 7,000 feet above sea level on very steep, south and west facing mountain slopes with gradients of 30 to 60 percent.  They formed in colluvium and residuum from limestone and calcareous sandstone.  The climate is moist subhumid with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F..  The average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 26 inches.  The frost free season is 90 to 130 days."

Also, Maughan soils have less than 35 percent cobbles and gravel in the argillic horizon and Elzinga soils contain less than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon."
