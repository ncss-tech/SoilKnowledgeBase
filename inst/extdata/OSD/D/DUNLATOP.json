  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 37 to 42 degrees F and mean annual summer temperature ranges from 49 to 57 degrees F.  These soils are noncalcareous throughout.  The solum ranges from 24 to 40 inches thick.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the A and B horizons and are dominately less than 3 inches in diameter.  Coarse fragments in the substrata range up to 35 percent and are pebble or cobble-size.  The particle size control section is sandy clay loam or clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay, 15 to 35 percent silt and 30 to 60 percent sand.  The contrasting material, influenced by ash and basaltic materials, occurs mainly below 16 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is slightly acid or medium acid.\nThe B/E horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  They are medium acid to strongly acid.\nThe contrasting ash influenced 2C horizon occurs at 20 to 40 inches below the surface.  It has hues of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 7 or 8, 6 or 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It ranges from medium acid to very strongly acid."

Hub and Rimton soils are slightly acid to slightly alkaline throughout.  Stringam soils have a solum thickness of 42 to 56 inches.  Telcher soils are neutral or slightly acid throughout.  Bramard soils have mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick and lack E horizons.   Nisula soils have solums 48 to 70 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dunlatop soils are on high mountains, side slopes, and uplands, at elevation of 9,400 to 11,200 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The soils are formed in basalt and ash materials which overlie volcanic ash influenced materials.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is 25 to 32 inches, the majority of which comes as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 35 to 38 degrees F.  Frost-free season is less than 60 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This series provides a concept with ash influence that the other Mollic Cryoboralfs do not have.  This soil will not meet the requirements of the Andept suborder; however, it is severely affected by the underlying volcanic ash.  The series name is coined from the Dunckley Flat Tops Mountain.  Laboratory Sample No. is S81CO-103-001.  Last updated by the state 4/94.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
