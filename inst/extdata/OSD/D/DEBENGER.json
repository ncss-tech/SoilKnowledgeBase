  "OVERVIEW": "The Debenger series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from sedimentary rocks.  Debenger soils are on ridges, fans and hillslopes and have slopes of 1 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist, but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 80 to 110 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 20 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It averages 18 to 25 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent gravel.  It is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry.  It is clay loam or loam, with 20 to 35 percent clay.  It is strongly or moderately acid."
