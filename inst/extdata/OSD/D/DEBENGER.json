The soils are usually moist, but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 80 to 110 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 20 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It averages 18 to 25 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent gravel.  It is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry.  It is clay loam or loam, with 20 to 35 percent clay.  It is strongly or moderately acid."

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from sedimentary rocks.   The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is 37 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is 72 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 40 inches.  The frost-free period is 130 to 200 days."
