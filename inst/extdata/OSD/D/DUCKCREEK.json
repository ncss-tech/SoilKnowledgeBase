  "OVERVIEW": "The Duckcreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils  that formed in interbedded shale and sandstone residuum and clayey sedimentary beds. These soils are on hills, mountains and escarpments. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
