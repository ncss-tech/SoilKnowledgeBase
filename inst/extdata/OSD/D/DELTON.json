  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the sandy mantle ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from about 30 to 50 inches.  Coarse fragments are absent throughout the pedon.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid  in the solum and is moderately acid or slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to  4.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. The Ap or A horizon is typically loamy fine sand, loamy sand, sand or fine sand but is fine sandy loam in some pedons.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, , value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is loamy fine sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or sand.\nThe 2Bt  horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand.\nThe 3Bt horizon typically has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR.  Less typically it has hue of 2.5YR.  Value is 4 to 6 and chroma is 3 to 6.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Clay content ranges from 35 to about 60 percent.\nThe 3C horizon has texture and color like the 2Bt2 horizon.  Thin lenses of coarser texture are in the C horizon in many pedons."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Delton soils are on nearly level to sloping areas of glacial lake basins, stream terraces, lake terraces, and outwash plains bordering lake basins.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Delton soils formed in sandy outwash or eolian deposits, in a loamy transition layer, and in the underlying clayey lacustrine deposits.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 29 to 32 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 44 to 50 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Plainfield, Wautoma, and Wyeville soils.  In some places, the somewhat poorly drained Wyeville and poorly drained and very poorly drained Wautoma series form a drainage sequence with the Delton soils, and occupy gentle gradients or level sites and depressions, respectively, in the landscape.  In other places, the excessively drained Plainfield soils are nearby where the sandy deposits thicken to more than 60 inches."
