  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the ash influenced silty loess mantle ranges from 2 to 12 inches.  The solum ranges in thickness from 3 to 11 inches and may be bisequal.  Average particle size of the control section is sandy with the average coarse fragment content ranging from 0 to 20 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum and moderately acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe E and Eb horizons have moist value from 4 through 7 and moist chroma from 1 through 4.  In some pedons, tonguing of the E into the underlying spodic horizon is common.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bs horizon has moist hue from 5YR through 7.5YR, moist value from 3 through 5 and moist chroma from 3 through 6. Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  In some pedons a few weakly cemented fragments with hue of 2.5YR or 5YR occur immediately below the albic horizon.\nThe 2Bsb horizon has moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, moist value from 3 through 5, and moist chroma from 4 through 6.  Texture is fine sand, loamy sand or sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 5 percent gravel.  This horizon is absent in many pedons.\nThe 2C horizon has moist hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, moist value of 3 or 4 and moist chroma from 2 through 4.  Texture is fine sand, sand or coarse sand. Discontinuous strata with textures of fine sandy loam through silt are present.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 5 percent cobble and 0 to 20 percent gravel with occasional pockets and strata with up to 50 percent gravel."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Delyndia soils are on outwash plains and hillslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in a loess mantle consisting of an admixture of amorphous material of volcanic origin and airborne sediments from broad nonvegetated floodplains.   he loess mantle is underlain by loose, sandy glacial outwash material.  Climate is transitional maritime - continental.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 32 to 36 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 27 inches."
