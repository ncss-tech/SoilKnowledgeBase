  "OVERVIEW": "The Delyndia series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a thin mantle of silty loess overlying loose, sandy glacial outwash.  Delyndia soils are on outwash plains and hillslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the ash influenced silty loess mantle ranges from 2 to 12 inches.  The solum ranges in thickness from 3 to 11 inches and may be bisequal.  Average particle size of the control section is sandy with the average coarse fragment content ranging from 0 to 20 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum and moderately acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe E and Eb horizons have moist value from 4 through 7 and moist chroma from 1 through 4.  In some pedons, tonguing of the E into the underlying spodic horizon is common.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bs horizon has moist hue from 5YR through 7.5YR, moist value from 3 through 5 and moist chroma from 3 through 6. Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  In some pedons a few weakly cemented fragments with hue of 2.5YR or 5YR occur immediately below the albic horizon.\nThe 2Bsb horizon has moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, moist value from 3 through 5, and moist chroma from 4 through 6.  Texture is fine sand, loamy sand or sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 5 percent gravel.  This horizon is absent in many pedons.\nThe 2C horizon has moist hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, moist value of 3 or 4 and moist chroma from 2 through 4.  Texture is fine sand, sand or coarse sand. Discontinuous strata with textures of fine sandy loam through silt are present.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 5 percent cobble and 0 to 20 percent gravel with occasional pockets and strata with up to 50 percent gravel."
