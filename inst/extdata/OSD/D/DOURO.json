  "OVERVIEW": "The Douro series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon.  The permeability is moderate above the very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon. Douro soils formed in calcareous loamy eolian sediments of the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping plains. The mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in) and the mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F). Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.",
