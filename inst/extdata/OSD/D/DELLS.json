  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 36 inches and commonly is the same as the thickness of the silty deposit over the loamy sand or sand.  The A horizon is medium acid to neutral.  The B and C horizons are strongly acid to neutral.  The upper part of the solum does not have coarse fragments, but the lower part of the solum and the substratum have 0 to 5 percent pebbles by volume.\nThe Ap or A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe BE horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 5.\nThe Bt horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 5, but in some subhorizons of the Bt horizon, the chroma is 2.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The part of the control section formed in the silty deposits averages between 20 and 32 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt2 horizon has similar colors as the Bt horizon.  It is sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe 2C horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 4 through 8, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loamy sand or sand, but some pedons have thin strata of sandy loam, loam, or silt loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the only series in this family.  Other series in closely related families are Canoe, Curran, Halder, Hayfield, Lawler, Poskin, Shiffer, and Tell.  Canoe and Curran soils have a thicker mantle of silty deposits and do not have a contrasting texture shallower than 40 inches.  Halder, Hayfield, and Shiffer soils contain more fine sand or coarser in the control section.  Lawler soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and have a mollic epipedon.  Poskin soils are in the same strongly contrasting particle-size class but have tonguing of the E horizon into the Bt horizon and are frigid.  Tell soils do not have mottles of low chroma in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:   Dells soils are on stream terraces and lake terraces.  Slope gradients are 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in 20 to 36 inches of loess or other silty deposits, or both, and in the underlying sand or loamy sand.  Mean annual preciptation ranges from 28 to 32 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 43 to 53 degrees F."

Curran, Lawler, and Shiffer soils are on similar landscape positions.  The Tell series are on higher positions in the landscape.  Bertrand soils formed in a thicker mantle of silty deposits.  In addition, the Bertrand soils are on higher positions in the landscape."
