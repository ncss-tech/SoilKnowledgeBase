  "OVERVIEW": "The Dryck series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium on floodplains stream terraces.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper 23 inches and very rapid below that depth.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
