  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 15 to 30 inches. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout unless limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Dry value is 6 or more.  Texture of the Ap horizon is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.  Undisturbed pedons have an A horizon that has colors and textures similar to the Ap horizon.  It is up to 5 inches thick.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6, with chroma of 2 or less restricted to subhorizons below 20 inches.  Texture is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4..  Texture is loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or silt.  Thin or very thin strata of silty clay loam or silty clay are in some pedons. The C horizon has weak, medium to very thick plates or it is massive."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Scio series is the only other series in the same family. Scio soils have moderate permeability to a depth of 40 inches. The Belgrade, Bridgehampton, Hitchcock, Nicholville, and Unadilla series are in related families.  Belgrade soils have base saturation greater than 60 percent.  The well drained and moderately well drained Bridgehampton soils have a bisequum.  Hitchcock soils do not have iron depletions within a depth of 24 inches.  Nicholville soils have a spodic horizon.  The well drained Unadilla soils have moderately rapid or rapid permeability below a depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dartmouth soils are on terraces and lake plains.  Slopes commonly are 0 to 8 percent, but range up to 15 percent.  The soils formed in silty lacustrine material.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F. The growing season ranges from 110 to 180 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the well drained Hitchcock, the poorly drained Raynham, the poorly drained Binghamville, and the very poorly drained Birsall soils.  Agawam, Enfield, Haven, Ninigret, Sudbury and Tisbury soils are in similar landscape positions, but formed in loamy over sandy materials.  Deerfield, Merrimac, and Windsor soils are in similar positions on the landscape, but formed in sandy or gravelly material.  Hadley, Limerick, Occum, Pootatuck, Rippowam and Winooski soils are on adjacent flood plains."

The former classification was Coarse-silty, mixed, active, mesic Aquic Dystrochrepts.  2.  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 11 inches (Ap horizon).\nb.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 11 to 22 inches (Bw horizon).\nc.  Aquic subgroup  feature - iron depletions within a depth of 24 inches from the mineral soil surface (lower part of the Bw horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
