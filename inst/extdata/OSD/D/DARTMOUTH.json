  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. CED-HRM-CAW",
  "REVDATE": "01/2000",
  "STATES": "NH",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Dartmouth series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in silty lacustrine material.  They are on terraces or lake plains. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow or slow in the substratum.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 15 to 30 inches. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout unless limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Dry value is 6 or more.  Texture of the Ap horizon is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.  Undisturbed pedons have an A horizon that has colors and textures similar to the Ap horizon.  It is up to 5 inches thick.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6, with chroma of 2 or less restricted to subhorizons below 20 inches.  Texture is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4..  Texture is loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or silt.  Thin or very thin strata of silty clay loam or silty clay are in some pedons. The C horizon has weak, medium to very thick plates or it is massive."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Scio series is the only other series in the same family. Scio soils have moderate permeability to a depth of 40 inches. The Belgrade, Bridgehampton, Hitchcock, Nicholville, and Unadilla series are in related families.  Belgrade soils have base saturation greater than 60 percent.  The well drained and moderately well drained Bridgehampton soils have a bisequum.  Hitchcock soils do not have iron depletions within a depth of 24 inches.  Nicholville soils have a spodic horizon.  The well drained Unadilla soils have moderately rapid or rapid permeability below a depth of 40 inches."

Agawam, Enfield, Haven, Ninigret, Sudbury and Tisbury soils are in similar landscape positions, but formed in loamy over sandy materials.  Deerfield, Merrimac, and Windsor soils are in similar positions on the landscape, but formed in sandy or gravelly material.  Hadley, Limerick, Occum, Pootatuck, Rippowam and Winooski soils are on adjacent flood plains."

The former classification was Coarse-silty, mixed, active, mesic Aquic Dystrochrepts.  2.  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 11 inches (Ap horizon).\nb.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 11 to 22 inches (Bw horizon).\nc.  Aquic subgroup  feature - iron depletions within a depth of 24 inches from the mineral soil surface (lower part of the Bw horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
