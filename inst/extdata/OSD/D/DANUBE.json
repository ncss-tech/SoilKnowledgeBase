  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to sand and gravel typically ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches thick. A calcic horizon is typically at the surface or within a depth of 16 inches.   The upper mantle has 15 to 32 percent clay size carbonates and a calcium carbonate equivalent of 15 to 35 percent. The upper mantle typically does not have rock fragments.  Rock fragment content in the lower material range from 0 to 35 percent. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A, Ap, Apk or Ak horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1. It is silty clay or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have an AB or ABk horizon.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2BCg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is loamy sand, sand, fine sand, loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, or their gravelly analogues."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Danube soils are on plane or slightly concave slopes with gradient of 0 to 2 percent on outwash plains and valley trains. They formed in a 20 to 40 inch thick mantle of alluvium or loess overlying sandy and gravelly outwash sediments that are Late Wisconsinan in age. Mean annual air temperature is about 45 to 48 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 25 to 30 inches. Frost-free days range from 124 to 155. Elevation above sea level ranges from 900 to 1300 feet."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Athelwold, Calco, Mayer, Millington, and Talcot series. The moderately well drained Athelwold soils are on higher lying terrain. The Calco and Millington soils are slightly lower on the landscape and do not have the sandy and gravelly underlying materials. The Mayer and Talcot soils are on similar landscape positions."
