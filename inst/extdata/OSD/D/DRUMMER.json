  "OVERVIEW": "The Drummer series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy stratified outwash on nearly level or depressional parts of outwash plains, stream terraces, and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",

Chalmers, Maxcreek and Maxfield soils are less than 40 inches to subhorizons that average more than 15 percent sand. Chetomba, Madelia, Pella, Rushmore, and Wacousta soils contain carbonates at depths less than 40 inches. Dolbee and Elvira soils formed in silty alluvial sediments on flood plains and river terraces and are subject to flooding.  Dolbee soils do not have stratification and typically have less sand in the substratum than the Drummer soils. Elvira soils have high concentrations of iron and manganese oxides in the solum. Dunham soils average more than 15 percent gravel in the lower part of the series control section. Elpaso, Gillett, and Grove soils have a well graded sand fraction in the lower part of the series control section.  Garwin, Hartsburg, Marcus, Mascoutah, Ossian, and Sable soils average less than 15 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Patton soils average less than 25 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section, and the sand fraction is dominantly fine and very fine sand."

The somewhat poorly drained Brenton, moderately well drained Clare and well drained Proctor soils have a thinner mantle of loess.

In drained conditions, an apparent seasonal high water table is 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 31 cm (1.0 foot) below the surface at some time between January and May in most years.  In undrained conditions, an apparent seasonal high water table is 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 foot) below the surface at some time between November and June in most years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Water ponds on these soils for brief periods during the spring. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate."

These soils are identified for study as part of future MLRA update activities. These soils will be evaluated to determine if they need to be re-correlated to different series or whether new series will need to be developed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nmollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 48 cm (19 inches) (Ap, A, and BA horizons);\ncambic horizon - the zone from approximately 48 to 119 cm (19 to 47 inches) (Bg, Btg1, Btg2, and 2Btg3 horizons);\nlithologic discontinuity - at a depth of 104 cm (41 inches) (contact between the Btg2 and 2Btg3 horizons);\naquic conditions - redoximorphic features present in the zone from approximately 36 to 152 cm (14 to 60 inches) (BA, Bg, Btg1, Btg2, 2Btg3, and 2Cg horizons);\naquic moisture regime; mesic temperature regime."
