  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Delacit series consists of shallow, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium mixed with spring deposited travertine. The Delacit soils are on beach plains. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
