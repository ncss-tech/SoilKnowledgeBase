The official series description was developed according to SSR01 Technical Note--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015). Further field investigation and laboratory sampling on outwash terraces in MLRA 2 is recommended to determine the distribution and influence of volcanic ash. Concurrent evaluation of Giles and Yelm series should be conducted as these soils formed in similar parent material and on similar landforms."
