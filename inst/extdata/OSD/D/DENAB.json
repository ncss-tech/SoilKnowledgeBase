  "OVERVIEW": "The Denab series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from tuff.  Denab soils are on pediments.  Slope ranges from 3 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
