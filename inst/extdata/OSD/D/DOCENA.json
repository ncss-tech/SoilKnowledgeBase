(3 to 7 inches thick)\nB21t--4 to 26 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) silt loam;\nfew medium distinct light brownish gray (10YR  6/2) mottles; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine\nand few medium roots; common fine and medium pores; thin\ndiscontinous clay films on faces of peds; light brownish gray\nmottles are in the lower part; very strongly acid; diffuse wavy boundary.\nB22t--26 to 40 inches; mottled brownish yellow (10YR 6/6),\nlight yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) and light gray (10YR 7/2) silt\nloam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable;\nfew fine roots; common fine pores; thin discontinous clay films on faces of peds; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.\n(Combined thickness of the B21t and B22t horizons is 25 to 55 inches.)\nIIB23t--40 to 58 inches; mottled brownish yellow (10YR 6/6), gray (10YR 6/1) and reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) silty clay loam; moderate coarse and medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; common fine pores; thick continuous clay films on\nfaces of peds; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 35\ninches thick)\nIIC--58 to 65 inches; mottled brownish yellow (10YR 6/6),\ngray (10YR 6/1) and reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) silty clay loam; massive; firm; strongly acid.\nTypeLocation:  Jefferson County, Alabama; 3.0 miles east of\nBessemer, 1,000 feet east and 1,900 feet south of the NW corner of Sec. 25, T. 19 S., R.4  W.\nRangeinCharacteristics:  Solum thickness is 40 to 60 inches.\nDepth to weathered shale or sandstone is more than 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to very strongly acid except\nwhere the surface layer has been limed.  Many pedons contain black\nor brown, manganese and iron concretions and accumulations.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The thickness of A horizons with values of\n3, is less than 6 inches.  Texture is generally silt loam, but the range includes loam and fine sandy loam.\nThe B1 or A2 horizon, where present, is silt loam or loam.  These horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and\nchroma of 4 or 6.\nThe upper B2t horizon has hue of 10YR and 7.5YR, value of 4\nthrough 6, and chroma of 4 through 8, with mottles of chroma 2 or less in the upper 24 inches.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The lower B2t horizon is mottled in shades of red, brown, yellow, and gray or it has the same hue, value, and chroma as the upper B2t horizon with common to many mottles of chroma 2 or less.\nThe IIBt horizon, where present, formed in residual shale and has silty clay or silty clay loam texture, or it formed in alluvial sediments and has loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or silt loam texture and is slightly brittle in less than 40 percent of the\nmass.  Horizons with these characteristics are more than 30 inches below the surface.\nThe C horizon material is variable in texture and color but is\nslowly permeable.  It is highly weathered shale, or firm\n@underclay@ which may contain layers of soft coal, or alluvial or colluvial sediments that contain few to many gravels and\nconcretions.\nCompetingSeries:  There are no other known series in this family.  The Abell, Altavista, Kirksey, and\nWhitwell series are similar soils in related families.  Abell, Altavista, and Whitwell soils are fine-loamy. Kirksey soils have siliceous mineralogy and slate bedrock at 40 to 60 inches.\nGeographicGEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Docena soils are on nearly level to gent sloping depressions, toeslopes, heads of drainageways, and high stream flood plains of the Appalachian Plateau and upland flats in limestone valleys. These soils formed in alluvial or colluvial sediments or in thin alluvial or colluvial sediments overlying material weathered from residual shale, locally known as\n@underclay.@  Slope is commonly 0 to 4 percent but ranges to 6 percent.\nGeographicallyAssociatedSoils:  These are Albertville,\nChoccolocco, Holston, Montevallo, Nauvoo, State, and Townley\nseries.  Albertville, Holston, Montevallo, Nauvoo, and Townley\nsoils are on uplands.  In addition, Albertville and Townley soils have clayey subsoils and shale bedrock within 60 inches of the surface, Holston and Nauvoo soils have fine-loamy subsoils, and Montevallo soils have shale bedrock within 20 inches of the\nsurface.  Choccolocco and State soils are on similar landscapes,\nbut lack mottles of chroma 2 or less within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon.\nDrainageandPermeability:  Moderately well drained.  Permeability\nis moderate in the upper part of the sola and slow to moderately\nslow in the lower B2t and C horizons.  A seasonal water table is within 1.5 to 3 feet during the winter and early spring.  Water\nmoves laterally through the soil and substratum immediately\nbeneath the soil.  Runoff is slow to medium.  Docena soils are subject to occasional shallow flooding for very brief periods.\nUseandVegetation:  Most of the Docena soils have been cleared and cropped in the past.  At present most of these soils are used for pasture.  Native vegetation includes oaks, yellow-poplar,\nhickories, shortleaf and loblolly pine.\nDistributionandExtent:  Appalachian Plateau of Alabama.  Possibly\nin Georgia and Tennessee.  The series is of small extent.\nSeriesEstablished:  Jefferson County, Alabama, 1980."
