The shale formation in Indiana is the Mississippian age New Providence; also named gray-green shale.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 1) Ochric epipedon: the zone from 0 to 8 cm (0 to 3 inches) (A horizon); 2) Argillic horizon: the zone from 8 to 61 cm (3 to 24 inches) (Bt1, Bt2 horizons); and 3) Paralithic contact: the zone where soil meets soft bedrock at 91 cm (36 inches).\nA very deep phase is recognized, (Bartholomew, Co. IN).\nThe representative component and horizon data is in DMU# 124, 496.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data for S90IN143-002 (typical pedon) and S03IN19-002 is at the National Soil Survey Lab, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
