The soil is noncalcareous to 60 inches or more, but some pedon may contain hard carbonate concretions within 30 inches of the soil surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 and chroma of 2. Texture is silty clay or clay, but may be silty clay loam or silt loam in areas with thin layers of recent overwash.\nThe Bwss1 horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3, or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2. Texture is clay. Mottles are in shades of yellow or brown. The lower Bwss horizons have hue of 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4; or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4; or hue of 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4. Mottles are in shades of red, brown, or gray. Texture is clay or silty clay. The weighted average of the 10-40 inch particle size control section ranges from 60 to 85 percent clay.

Series in closely related families include Bonham, Buxin, Chireno, Dardanelle, Egam, Moreland, Perry, Pledger, Portland, Roebuck, and Zaar. Bonham soils have argillic horizons and are in a fine particle size class. Buxin, Moreland, and Pledger soils are in a mixed mineralogy class and are in a fine particle size class. Chireno and Egam soils are in a fine particle size class and do not have vertic properties. Dardanelle soils have argillic horizons, do not have vertic properties, and are in a fine-silty particle size class. Perry soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are in a mixed mineralogy class. Portland soils do not have a mollic epipedon. Roebuck and Zaar soils are in a fine particle size class."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in clayey alluvium from Permian geological formations. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 51 inches near the type location."

These soils occur on ridge-swale, flood plains, or slack water areas adjacent to Desha soils. Bowdre soils do not have thick dark colored surface layers and formed in thin clayey alluvium over loamy sediments. Latanier and Wabbaseka soils also formed in thin clayey alluvium over loamy sediments. McGehee soils are in a fine-silty particle-size class and do not have thick dark surface layers. Oklared soils are in a coarse-loamy particle size class and are calcareous. Sharkey soils have thin dark surface layers and grayer subsoils. Robinsonville soils are in a coarse-loamy particle-size class and do not have thick dark surface layers."
