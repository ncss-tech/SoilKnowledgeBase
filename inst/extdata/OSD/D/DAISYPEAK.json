The potential native range vegetation is highly dependent upon elevation and can consist of sedges, Idaho fescue, rough fescue, poverty grass, alpine bluegrass, alpine death camas, vetch, gentain and shrubby cinquefoil.  Forested areas consist of a mixed overstory of spruce, Douglas-fir, subalpine fir, lodgepole pine and whitebark pine with an understory of elk sedge, pinegrass, vetch, arnica, clematis, and cleft leaved groundsel."
