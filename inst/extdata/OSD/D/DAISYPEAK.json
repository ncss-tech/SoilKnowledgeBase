  "OVERVIEW": "The Daisypeak series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum or colluvium over residuum derived from calcareous sedimentary rock sources. These soils are on mountains, ridges, and structural benches.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 765 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.",

Forested areas consist of a mixed overstory of spruce, Douglas-fir, subalpine fir, lodgepole pine and whitebark pine with an understory of elk sedge, pinegrass, vetch, arnica, clematis, and cleft leaved groundsel."
