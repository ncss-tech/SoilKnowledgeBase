Bear Lake soils lack an accumulation of organic material on floodplains and low stream terraces. Bloomington soils have a thick dark mineral soil surface on lake plains. Chesbrook soils are carbonatic and lack an accumulation of organic soil material. Dingle soils have a thick layer of organic material in the upper part on the same landscape position. Picabo soils are carbonatic and have less than 18 percent clay in the control section on low alluvial fans."
