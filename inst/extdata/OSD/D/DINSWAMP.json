  "OVERVIEW": "The Dinswamp series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in organic material over lake sediments. These soils are on lakebeds and lake terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
