  "OVERVIEW": "The Deatman series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from greenish tuff, breccia and agglomerate.  Deatman soils are on ridgetops and hillsides in mountainous terrain and have slopes of 20 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist and are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days during the four-month period following the summer solstice.  Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The average of rock fragments in the profile above bedrock range from 15 to 30 percent pebbles, 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent stones.  The average in the control section ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 25 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is gravelly or cobbly loam or sandy clay loam and has 20 to 30 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is gravelly or cobbly loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe underlying bedrock ranges from grayish green, olive to olive brown."
