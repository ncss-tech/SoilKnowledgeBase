The soils are usually moist and are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days during the four-month period following the summer solstice.  Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The average of rock fragments in the profile above bedrock range from 15 to 30 percent pebbles, 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent stones.  The average in the control section ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 25 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is gravelly or cobbly loam or sandy clay loam and has 20 to 30 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is gravelly or cobbly loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe underlying bedrock ranges from grayish green, olive to olive brown."
