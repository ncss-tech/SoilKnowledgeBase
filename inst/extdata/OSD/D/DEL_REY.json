The particle-size control section averages between 35 and 45 percent clay.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E or Eg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral. Some pedons have a EB or BE horizon with properties similar to the E horizon.\nThe Bt or Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 6. It is silty clay loam or silty clay. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe BC, BCg, BCt, or BCtg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 8. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay. The lower part of the horizon is stratified in some pedons and some strata are silt loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. The horizon is calcareous in some pedons.\nThe Cg or C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 8. It commonly is silt loam or silty clay loam several feet thick. Some pedons are stratified with layers of silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy loam, sand, and silty clay. Average clay content ranges from 22 to 33 percent. Average sand content ranges from 5 to 20 percent. Rock fragment content is less than 2 percent. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

The soils formed in calcareous silt loam or silty clay loam lacustrine sediments. Some pedons have clay loam till in the substratum below depths of 112 centimeters (44 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from about 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 737 to 1,016 millimeters (29 to 40 inches).

Aptakisic, Martinton Nappanee, and Starks soils are on nearby similar positions. Aptakisic and Starks soils contain less clay. Martinton soils have mollic epipedons. The Camden, Saylesville, and Zurich soils are better drained, contain less clay in the control section, and are on higher landform positions. The poorly drained and very poorly drained Milford soils are on nearby nearly level or depressional parts of glacial lake plains and have a mollic epipedon."

These soils will be evaluated during MLRA update activities.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 23 centimeters (9 inches) (A and E horizons); albic horizon - the zone from a depth of 10 to 23 centimeters (4 to 9 inches) (E horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 23 to 84 centimeters (9 to 33 inches) (Bt, Btg1, and Btg2 horizons); aquic conditions - presence of redoximorphic features in the zone from 23 to 152 centimeters (9 to 60 inches) (E, Bt, Btg1, Btg2, BCtg, and Cg horizons.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data from the typical pedon is on file at the Illinois State Office; laboratory numbers 19865 to 19872, dated August 5, 1965.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
