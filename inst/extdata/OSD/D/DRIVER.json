    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum is 22 to 35 inches.  The soil from a depth of 9 to 23 inches is assumed to be dry in all parts from April 15th until January 15th and is continuously moist in some part for less than 90 consecutive days.  Gravel content is 0 to 15 percent.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/4, 6/3, 5/4 or 5/3 and moist color of 10YR 5/3, 4/4, 4/3 or 3/4.  It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  Clay content is 8 to 25 percent.  The B2t horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/4, 5/6, 6/4; 7.5YR 5/4 or 5/6 and moist color of 10YR 3/6, 4/4, 4/6; or 7.5YR 4/4.  The texture is loam, or clay loam.  Clay content is 20 to 35 percent.  The clay increase from the A to the Bt horizon is 5 to 20 percent.  In some pedons the lower part of the Bt horizon is weakly cemented with silica.\nThe upper part of the C horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 5/4; 10YR 5/6 or 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/3, or 4/4.  It is weakly cemented with silica but when crushed it is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  The structure is moderately subangular blocky or structureless.\nThe lower part of the C horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/4, 5/6, 6/3 or 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/3 or 4/4.  It is commonly stratified with textures of loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or loam coarse sand.  There are 2 to 15 percent gravel in this horizon.  Clay content is 5 to 20 percent throughout the C horizon."

The climate is arid with hot dry summers and cool somewhat moist winters.  Ground fog occurs in winter.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches.  Mean January temperature is 48 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 84 degrees F.; the mean annual temperature is 64 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 250 to 300 days."
