  "OVERVIEW": "The Driver series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from granitic rock.  Driver soils are formed on alluvial terraces of 0 to 2 percent slopes.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",

The soil from a depth of 9 to 23 inches is assumed to be dry in all parts from April 15th until January 15th and is continuously moist in some part for less than 90 consecutive days.  Gravel content is 0 to 15 percent.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/4, 6/3, 5/4 or 5/3 and moist color of 10YR 5/3, 4/4, 4/3 or 3/4.  It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  Clay content is 8 to 25 percent.  The B2t horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/4, 5/6, 6/4; 7.5YR 5/4 or 5/6 and moist color of 10YR 3/6, 4/4, 4/6; or 7.5YR 4/4.  The texture is loam, or clay loam.  Clay content is 20 to 35 percent.  The clay increase from the A to the Bt horizon is 5 to 20 percent.  In some pedons the lower part of the Bt horizon is weakly cemented with silica.\nThe upper part of the C horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 5/4; 10YR 5/6 or 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/3, or 4/4.  It is weakly cemented with silica but when crushed it is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  The structure is moderately subangular blocky or structureless.\nThe lower part of the C horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/4, 5/6, 6/3 or 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/3 or 4/4.  It is commonly stratified with textures of loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or loam coarse sand.  There are 2 to 15 percent gravel in this horizon.  Clay content is 5 to 20 percent throughout the C horizon."
