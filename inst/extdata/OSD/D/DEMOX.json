The soil between depths of 10 to 30 inches is dry is all parts from about July 10 until November 10 (120 days).  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts less than half the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.\nMollic epipedon ranges from 21 to 36 inches thick.  Stones and cobbles cover 5 to 30 percent of the soil surface.  Clay content ranges from 10 to 18 percent throughout the profile.  Reaction ranges from mildly to moderately alkaline.  The 10 to 40 inch particle size control section has 35 to 50 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/2 or 4/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/3, 3/2 or 3/1.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 50 percent.  Stones and cobbles range from 5 to 30 percent.  Gravel range from 10 to 20 percent.  Texture is stony sandy loam and very stony sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/4, 6/3, 5/3 or 2.5Y 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/4, 4/3 or 3/3.

Dehlinger soils have a particle-size control section that averages 18 to 30 percent clay and are dry 90 to 120 days.  Drit soils are dry 90 to 100 days and are slightly acid or neutral.  Gamboa soils have a mean soil temperature of 54 degrees to 58 degrees F. and are always above 41 degrees F.  Langrell soils are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days and cobbles and stones are the dominant coarse fragment.  Packard soils have a particle-size control section that averages 25 to 35 percent clay, are slightly acid and have a soil temperature that ranges from 52 degrees to 57 degrees F.  Wrentham soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches."

The soils formed in colluvium weathered from basalt and tuff.  Elevations are 4,035 to 5,000 feet.  The climate is semiarid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 to 16 inches.  Snowfall is 15 to 25 inches.  The average annual temperature is about 46 to 50 degrees F.  The average January temperature is about 28 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 63 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 60 to 80 days."
