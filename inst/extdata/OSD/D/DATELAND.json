  "OVERVIEW": "The Dateland series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in stream or fan alluvium and eolian deposits. Dateland soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, fan piedmonts,  or relict basin floors. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches (18 cm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 70 degrees F (21.1 degrees C).",
