  "OVERVIEW": "The Demar series consists of deep or very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in clayey alluvium from acid clay shales.  These soils are on terraces.  They have very slow permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

These soils range from neutral to strongly acid in the upper 12 inches and from very strongly acid to extremely acid below this depth.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is loam but is clay loam in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The clay content of the Bt horizon is between 35 and 60 percent.  Structure of the Bt horizon ranges from weak or moderate, medium or coarse columnar in the Bt1 horizon and moderate or strong, medium or coarse blocky in the Bt2 horizon.\nThe Bz horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 3.  It has common or many accumulations of gypsum and other salts.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It contains 20 to 50 percent fragments of shale."

In addition, the Graner soils are more friable and the Grummit soils have shale within depths of 20 inches.  Broadhurst soils are on similar landscapes as the Demar soils.  Graner and Grummit soils are on adjacent undulating to steeply sloping uplands.  Demar soils are usually associated with slickspots which are nearly barren and have a nearly continuous dispersed surface crust and are in micro-lows."
