  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and the depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 degrees to 55 degrees F.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from March 15 to December 15 and exceeds 47 degrees from April 15 to November 15.  The soil is dry in all parts of the moisture control section (9 to 24 inches) from July 1 to October 15 and is moist in all parts of the moisture control section form January 1 to May 15.  The particle-size control section (10 to 24 inches) ranges from 10 to 25 percent clay and has 35 to 55 percent rock fragments.  Base saturation of the solum is 25 to 40 percent throughout by sum of cation.  Reaction of the solum is medium through very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/4 or 4/3 and moist color of 10YR 3/3, 3/2, or 2/2.  It is gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loam. Gravel ranges from 15 to 30 percent.  Where the A horizon is not thick enough for an umbric epipedon the upper part of the B2 horizon is dark enough to qualify.\nThe Bw horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/4 or 5/3 and moist color of 10YR 4/4, 4/3, 3/4, or 3/3.  It is very gravelly sandy clay loam, very gravelly sandy loam, or very gravelly loam.  The upper part of the Bw horizon ranges from less than 35 to more then 35 percent fragments.  The average of the control section is greater than 35 percent.  Clay content usually increases by less than 1.2 times that of the overlying horizon and where it does increase by more than 1.2 times, the increase in clay is reached in more than 30 cm veritical distance.  Total rock fragments range from 35 to 55 percent and consist of stones and cobbles that range from 0 to 10 percent, and gravel ranges from 30 to 45 percent."

Mean January temperature is about 36 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 66 degrees F; mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 110 to 180 days."
