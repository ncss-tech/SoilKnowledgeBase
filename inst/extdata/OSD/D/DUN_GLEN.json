    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dun Glen soils are on fan skirts, inset fans, and basin floor remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a loess mantle high in volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,160 to 1,680 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
