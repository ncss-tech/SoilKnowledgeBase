  "OVERVIEW": "The Duzen series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary sources. Duzen soils are on river terraces and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1780 millimeters (70 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
