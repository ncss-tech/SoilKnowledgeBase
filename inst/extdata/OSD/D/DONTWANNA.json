    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dontwanna soils are on glacial outwash fan remnants.  They typically occur on summit positions. They formed in predominately volcanic alluvium derived from andesite. Slopes are 8 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 1,680 to 2,134 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 70 to 90 days."

Heenlake soils have a paralithic contact between 50 to 100 cm. Slinkard soils have a mollic epipedon more than 50 cm thick. Toejom soils have a paralithic contact within 50 cm and an ochric epipedon."
