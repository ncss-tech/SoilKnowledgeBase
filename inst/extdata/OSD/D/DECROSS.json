The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 35 to 45 degrees F. and the mean annual summer soil temperature ranges from 49 to 58 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent gravel or channers.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam averaging 18 to 35 percent clay.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent gravel or channers.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Matrix texture is loam or light clay loam.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent gravel or cobbles.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.  The calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 40 percent and decreases by more than 5 percent in some lower horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Decross soils are on mountain slopes, relict alluvial fans, fan aprons, and pediment toeslopes.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium from limestone.  Elevation is 5,600 to 9,000 feet.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 to 24 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 33 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated at 30 to 70 days depending upon elevation, aspect, and air drainage."
