  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  In most years, the soils are usually moist but are dry for more than 80 to 90 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches within the 4 month period following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches. The solum is 20 to 40 inches thick. Organic matter decreases to less than 1 percent above depth of 20 inches and commonly between depths of 10 and 15 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Rock fragments up to about 1 inch in diameter range up to 3 percent in the solum.\nThe B horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist. It is silt loam or loam with 16 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fragments coarser than very fine sand. This horizon has weak medium to fine subangular blocky structure. It has up to 5 percent noncalcareous nodules 1/2 to 1 inch in diameter."

Anders soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Beckley, Bong, Chenoweth, Cleverly, Conconully, Juliaetta, Knutsen, Laidlaw, Newborn, Owhi, Phoebe, Uhlig, and Wato soils lack a paralithic or lithic contact above depth of 40 inches. Also, Beckley, Bong, Conconully, Knutsen, Laidlaw, and Phoebe soils are moderately coarse textured. Cleverly, Hesslan and Knutsen soils have 5 to 35 percent rock fragments in their control section. Also, Hesslan soils dominantly are loam in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Duart soils are on uplands and have nearly level to steep slopes. Dominant gradients are up to 25 percent but slopes range to 55 percent. Elevations range from 800 to 1,800 feet. The soils formed in a reworked loess mantle with an appreciable component of volcanic ash overlying semiconsolidated sandstone. Summers are warm and dry with an average July temperature of 68 degrees F. Winters are cool and moist with an average January temperature of 31 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 48 degrees to 50 degrees F. Precipitation ranges from 12 to 14 inches annually. Frost-free period is 120 to 150 days."
