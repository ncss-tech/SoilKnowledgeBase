  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Fondis, Iliff, Jonpol, Platmak, Platner and Platsher series.  Fondis soils have a lithologic discontinuity within the argillic horizon.  Iliff soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Jonpol soils area moderately deep.  Platmak and Platner soils do not have a coarse sand 2C horizon.  Platsher soils have a 2Bk horizon that has more than 15 percent rock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dawes soils are on nearly level or very gently sloping uplands with slope gradients of 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in medium and moderately fine textured loess containing carbonates.  The underlying materials are bedrock or coarse sand that limit effective root penetration.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 20 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  Frost-free days range from 120 to 140 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Alliance, Keith, Kuma, Rosebud, Richfield and Scott soils.  All the associated soils, except Scott, are slightly higher on the landscape and are better drained; they also lack E horizons and contain less clay in the argillic horizon.  Scott soils are very poorly drained, in depressions and pond water for long duration."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Permeability is slow in the Bt horizon, moderate in the C horizon, and very rapid in the 2C horizon.  Runoff is low.  These soils have a slowly permeable layer within the upper 1 meter that keeps the soil wet close enough to the surface for long enough periods that planting or harvesting operations are adversely affected on some areas during prolonged wet periods."

Consideration should be given to changing the classification accordingly.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  S58NE049-003 (Type Location), and S58NE049-004.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
