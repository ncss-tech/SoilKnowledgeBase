  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 4 to 15 inches.  Depth to soft shale bedrock ranges from 8 to 20 inches and hard bedrock is normally within 40 inches.  The reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  Fragments of shale and limestone range from 10 to 45 percent in the A horizon and 35 to 65 percent in the B and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, valve of 4 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4 or value of 3 and chroma of 1 to 4.  The E horizon, where present, has hue 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture of the fine earth is silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay and rarely loam or clay loam.\nThe Bw and Bt horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 or 6.  Mottles in shades of brown, yellow and red range from none to common.  Texture of the fine earth is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay and rarely clay loam.  The higher clay content in the Bw horizon is inherited from the parent rock.\nThe BC horizon or C horizon, where present,has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 4 or 6.  Mottles in shades of brown, yellow, red or gray range from none to common.  Texture of the fine earth is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay and rarely clay loam."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Dandridge is the only series in this family.  These are the Armuchee, Colyer, Eden, Inman, Litz, Needmore, and Sulphura series in closely associated families.  All of these soils except Colyer lack bedrock within 20 inches of the soil surface.  Armuchee and Colyer soils are strongly acid.  Eden and Needmore soils have continuous argillic horizons.  Inman soils are thermic.  Litz soils are strongly acid.  Sulphura soils are loamy-skeletal and silicious."

These soils formed in residuum from calcareous shales with thin strata of limestone and calcareous sandstone in places.  Average annual temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F.  and average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches."
