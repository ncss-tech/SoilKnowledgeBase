  "OVERVIEW": "The Dehart series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till and colluvium primarily from metamorphic rock.  Dehart soils are on mountains with slopes of 5 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
