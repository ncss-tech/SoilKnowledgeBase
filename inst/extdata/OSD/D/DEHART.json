The soil is usually moist in all horizons but is dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days during summer and autumn.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.45 to 1.55 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.   The particle-size control section is 35 to 70 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry and 3 through 5 moist.  It is very gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam, very cobbly loam, very cobbly sandy loam and extremely stony sandy loam.  It is 40 to 70 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is very gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam, very cobbly loam, extremely gravelly loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, extremely stony sandy loam, or extremely stony loamy fine sand.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dehart soils are on glaciated mountain sides, and slopes adjacent to drainages in glaciated regions at elevations of 1,500 to 3,500 feet.  The slopes are usually convex and range from 5 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in medium and coarse textured glacial till and colluvium with a component of loess and volcanic ash in the surface layer.  Dehart soils are in a continental climate with dry, warm summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean temperature in January is 25 degrees F, in July 67 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 20 inches.  The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 130 days."

Aits, Donavan, Stevens, and Waits soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Cedonia and Hunters soils have a fine-silty control section and formed in glacial lake sediments.  Garrison, Scoap and Stevens soils have a mollic epipedon.  Hardesty soils are ashy.  Raisio soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Rufus soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to bedrock. Scoap and Waits soils are frigid.  Springdale soils are sandy-skeletal."
