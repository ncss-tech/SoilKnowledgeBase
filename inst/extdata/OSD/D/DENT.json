  "OVERVIEW": "The Dent series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments on outwash plains, glacial lake plains, moraines and lake terraces. These soils have moderate permeability. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",

The well drained Almora soils are on similar positions in the landscape and have loamy mantle 24 to 40 inches over the sandy outwash. The very poorly drained Cathro soils are in depressions and along the edges of lakes. The well drained Lida soils formed in outwash and are on convex positions in the more sloping parts of the landscape. The well drained Lizzie soils are on higher lying more convex positions in the landscape. The poorly drained Pinelake soils are in shallow depressions, swales and along the edges of depressions of organic soils."
