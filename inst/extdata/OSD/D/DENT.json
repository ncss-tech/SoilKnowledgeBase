The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness.\nThe A or Ap horizon has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons have an E horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam with subhorizons of loam. It averages less than 15 percent fine or coarser with a clay content of 18 to 35 percent. It is moderately acid to neutral\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. It typically is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, silt or loam, but includes thin subhorizons of fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand or very fine sand.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Dent soils have linear to convex slopes on outwash plains, glacial lake plains, moraines and lake terraces. They formed in lacustrine sediments of Late Wisconsinan Age. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. The mean annual temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 22 to 28 inches. Annual frost free days range from 90 to 140 days. The elevation above sea level ranges from 1000 to 1600 feet."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Almora, Cathro, Lida, Lizzie, and Pinelake soils. The well drained Almora soils are on similar positions in the landscape and have loamy mantle 24 to 40 inches over the sandy outwash. The very poorly drained Cathro soils are in depressions and along the edges of lakes. The well drained Lida soils formed in outwash and are on convex positions in the more sloping parts of the landscape. The well drained Lizzie soils are on higher lying more convex positions in the landscape. The poorly drained Pinelake soils are in shallow depressions, swales and along the edges of depressions of organic soils."
