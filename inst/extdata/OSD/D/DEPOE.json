  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soil has a udic moisture regime; but has a short dry period of less than 45 days during the four-month period following the summer solstice.  Depth to the ortstein layer is 12 to 20 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 15 to 27 percent clay.  The mineral surface when mixed to a depth of 10 inches has moist value of 2 or 3, 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR with value of 2 to 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR with value of 3 through 5 moist, 6 through 8 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is loam, sandy loam or silt loam.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe 2Bsm and 2BCsm horizon is variegated, with hues of 10YR through 2.5YR, value of 3 through 7 and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is loamy sand, fine sand, sand with moderate to strong cementation.  The stronger cementation is in the redder bands indicating iron and/or aluminum cementation. The free iron to carbon ratio ranges from 0.2 to 2.\nThe 2C horizon is variegated loamy fine sand, fine sand or sand that is weakly stratified in some areas and has intermittent lenses cemented by iron and/or aluminum.  It is strongly acid or moderately acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Depoe soils are in depressional to gently sloping areas on marine terraces at elevations of 50 to 400 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  They formed in weakly stratified marine sediments and eolian deposits.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 90 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 49 to 53 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 53 degrees F., and the mean January temperature is about 49 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 300 days.  Depoe soils occur on the Pioneer Geomorphic surface."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bandon, Blacklock, Bullards, Ferrelo, Fendall, Lint, Nelscott, Netarts and Yaquina soils.  Bandon soils are well drained and have an ortstein layer at 20 to 36 inches.  Bullards, Netarts, and Yaquina soils lack an ortstein layer and are very deep.  In addition, Bullards soils are coarse-loamy and Blacklock, Netarts and Yaquina soils are sandy.  Ferrelo, Fendall, and Lint soils lack a spodic horizon.  Nelscott soils are moderately well drained and are 24 to 40 inches deep to the cemented Bsm horizon."

A perched water table fluctuates between depths of 1 and 2 feet below the surface during the summer months and to 0.5 feet above the surface from October to May."
