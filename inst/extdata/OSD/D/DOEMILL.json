The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about May to about October (about 150 to 200 days).  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay and 2 to 35 percent rock fragments, mostly gravel.  Mineralogy is mixed.  A fluctuating water table can occur between the top of the bedrock and 2 inches (5 cm) below the surface of the soil from November through March.  Redoximorphic features such as iron-manganese masses occur in the Bt horizon and manganese accumulations occur in layers 1/16 to 1/8 inch thick on top of the bedrock.  Rock fragments on the surface range from 0 to 20 percent gravel, 2 to 10 percent cobbles, 0 to 10 percent stones and 0 to 5 percent boulders.  Some pedons have a 1/16 inch, (2 mm) thick organic mat on the surface.\nThe A horizon dry color is 5YR 4/6, 5/6 or 7.5YR 5/6.  Moist color is 2.5YR 3/4, 5YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4 or 7.5YR 3/3.  Texture is loam or gravelly loam.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 24 percent.  Rock fragments range from 1 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent stones.
