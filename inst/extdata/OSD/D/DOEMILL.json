  "REVDATE": "10/2006",
  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Doemill series consists of shallow, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in residuum from volcanic mudflow breccia.  Doemill soils are on mounds and convex areas on ridge tops and side slopes on volcanic ridges in Cascade foothills.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches, (660 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F, (16 degrees C).",

A fluctuating water table can occur between the top of the bedrock and 2 inches (5 cm) below the surface of the soil from November through March.  Redoximorphic features such as iron-manganese masses occur in the Bt horizon and manganese accumulations occur in layers 1/16 to 1/8 inch thick on top of the bedrock.  Rock fragments on the surface range from 0 to 20 percent gravel, 2 to 10 percent cobbles, 0 to 10 percent stones and 0 to 5 percent boulders.  Some pedons have a 1/16 inch, (2 mm) thick organic mat on the surface.\nThe A horizon dry color is 5YR 4/6, 5/6 or 7.5YR 5/6.  Moist color is 2.5YR 3/4, 5YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4 or 7.5YR 3/3.
