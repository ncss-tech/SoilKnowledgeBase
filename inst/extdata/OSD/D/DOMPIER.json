The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 56 degrees F.  The soil is usually moist but is dry within all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section has 20 to 30 percent clay and 10 to 15 percent sand that is coarser than very fine.  Depth to redoximorphic depletions having chroma of 2 or less is 18 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  Clay content is 10 to 15 percent.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel.  It is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y moist, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam with 20 to 30 clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.  It is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Btx horizon has matrix hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dompier soils are on mountain sideslopes, benches and foot slopes.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from schist and other metasedimentary rocks and to some extent, from granodiorite.  Slopes are 30 to 60 percent.  Elevations are 1100 to 2800 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 54 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 35 to 60 inches.  The frost free period is 100 to 200 days."
