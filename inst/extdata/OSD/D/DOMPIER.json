  "OVERVIEW": "The Dompier series consists of moderately deep to a fragipan, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from schist.  Dompier soils are on mountain sideslopes,benches and foot slopes. Slopes are 30 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

(Bt and Btg horizons), clay content of the Bt and Btg is 23 and 26 percent respectively.\nFragipan - from 32 to 60 inches.  (Btgx horizon)\nParticle-size control section - from 16 to 32 inches.  (Bt and Btg horizons), averages 24 percent clay, 61 percent silt and 15 percent sand.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added to the classification in 10/2005.
