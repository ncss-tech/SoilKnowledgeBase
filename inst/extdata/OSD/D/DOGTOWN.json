    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is typically greater than 60 inches but may be 40 to 60 inches in some pedons.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.00 to 1.20 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent. Gravels are typically 2 to 5 mm in size.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  It is gravelly loam or very stony loam.  It has 10 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles and 0 to 30 percent stones.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 30 to 50 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 40 percent stones.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loamy sand or sand with 30 to 60 percent gravel, 10 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 40 percent stones.  The pH ranges from moderately to slightly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dogtown soils are on moderately steep and steep metastable and active north-facing side slopes of forested mountains.  Elevations range from 3,800 to 6,200 feet.  Slope is 12 to 80 percent.  The soil is formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from quartz diorite, with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 30 to 50 days."
