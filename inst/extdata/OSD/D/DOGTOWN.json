  "OVERVIEW": "The Dogtown series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils on forested mountains.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from quartz diorite with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  Slopes are 12 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Gravels are typically 2 to 5 mm in size.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  It is gravelly loam or very stony loam.  It has 10 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles and 0 to 30 percent stones.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.
