  "OVERVIEW": "The Diobsud series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in colluvium and glacial till high in phyllite with an admixture of volcanic ash.  Diobsud soils are on glacially modified mountain sides.  Slopes are 3 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 90 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an albic horizon from the mineral surface to 2 inches, a spodic horizon from 2 to 13 inches, andic soil materials from 0 to 28 inches, and a paralithic contact at 28 inches.  The spodic horizon meets chemical criteria and averages more than 6 percent organic carbon in the upper 4 inches."
