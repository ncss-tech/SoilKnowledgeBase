  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to loam or clay loam glacial till ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 40 inches and commonly corresponds to the depth to till. The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches in thickness and extends into the Bw horizon in most pedons. The particle size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay and 5 to 15 percent fine sand and coarser in the eolian sediments and 24 to 35 percent clay with more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser in the underlying glacial till.  Coarse fragments of mixed lithology typically are absent in the eolian sediments but the glacial till commonly contains 1 to 10 percent by volume.  A thin pebble band is at the contact of the two sediments in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 3 to 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is loam but is silt loam in some pedons.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It dominantly is loam or silt loam but is sandy loam or sandy clay loam in the lower part of some pedons.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam or loam.  It is slightly to moderately alkaline.  There are few to many accumulations of carbonate.  Some pedons have a Bk horizon. Some pedons have a 2Bw horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Distinct or prominent redox features are common or many in the 2C horizons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Flandreau, Germantown, Grovena, and Ves series.  Flandreau soils have sandy underlying material. Germantown soils have hard bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Grovena soils do not have glacial till within 40 inches of the surface. Ves soils formed entirely in glacial till."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dobalt soils are on nearly level to gently sloping uplands. Slopes are plane or convex. Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent. These soils formed in 20 to 40 inches of loamy eolian material overlying glacial till. Mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 26 inches.  Growing season is about 135 to 165 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 17 to 20 inches; and growing degree days are about 2700 to 3500."

The Flandreau, Grovena, and Splitrock soils generally are on similar positions on the landscape. In addition, Splitrock soils are fine-silty.   Bonilla soils have a thicker mollic epipedon and are on foot slopes.  Houdek soils formed in till, have an argillic horizon, and are on more convex slopes and narrow summits."
