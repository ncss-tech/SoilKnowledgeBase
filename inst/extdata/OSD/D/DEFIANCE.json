  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Other series in similar families include the Cape, Melvin, Newark, Orrville, Shoals, Sloan, and Wabasha series. Cape, Melvin, and Wabasha soils have low chroma matrix colors in all horizons to a depth of 76 cm (30 inches). In addition, Cape soils have smectitic clay mineralogy and are acid; Melvin soils have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section; and Wabasha soils have surface horizons with value of 3 or less. Newark, Orrville, Shoals, and Sloan soils have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. In addition, Sloan soils have a mollic epipedon and low chroma matrix colors to a depth of 76 cm (30 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Defiance soils are on flood plains of the sluggish tributaries that dissect the lake plain and are on some local depressed areas of ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Defiance soils formed in neutral or slightly alkaline recent alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 940 mm (30 to 37 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 9 to 12 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F)."

The very poorly drained Hoytville, Latty, and Paulding soils are on nearby lake plains. Shoals soils formed in loamy material and are on similar positions on the landscape. The very poorly drained Sloan and Wabasha soils are on slightly lower or in depressed positions in the landscape."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {

Depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 30 to 76 cm (1.0 to 2.5 feet) during late winter and spring in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. Permeability is slow. These soils are subject to occasional or frequent flooding."

Native vegetation is deciduous, swamp forest dominated by water-tolerant hardwoods, such as elm, cottonwood, sycamore, and silver maple."
