  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Delette series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived mainly from mixed rock sources. These soils are on fans and footslopes. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
