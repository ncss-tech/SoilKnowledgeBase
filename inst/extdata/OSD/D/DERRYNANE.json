  "OVERVIEW": "The Derrynane series consists of very deep, poorly drained and somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in a mantle of silty and clayey colluvial or glacio-lacustrine sediment over calcareous, loamy glacial till. Permeability is slow. Slopes range from 1 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The 10 to 40 inch particle size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay. A clay increase is typical in the B horizons but the B/A clay ratio is less than 1.2. The mantle of colluvial and glacio-lacustrine sediment typically ranges from 30 to 50 inches but some pedons range as thick as 70 inches. The lacustrine mantle typically does not have coarse fragments, but may contain up to 2 percent coarse fragments in some pedons. The underlying glacial till contains 2 to 8 percent coarse fragments, by volume, of mixed lithology. The sand content ranges from 30 to 45 percent and the clay content ranges from 18 to 32 percent in the glacial till.\nThe Ap and A horizons have a hue of 10YR or are neutral, value of 2 in the upper part and 2 or 3 in the lower part, with a chroma of 0 to 2. They are silty clay loam, clay loam or silty clay. Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bg or Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, values of 2 or 3 in the upper part, 4 in the lower part, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silty clay loam, clay loam or silty clay. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons may have a Bkg horizon.\nThe 2Bg or 2Btg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loam or clay loam. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2BCg horizon has a hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 1 to 3. It is loam or clay loam. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2Cg has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loam or clay loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Okoboji soils are saturated in the upper one fourth of the series control section for more than half of the 120 days following the summer solstice in an undrained condition. Wabash soils average more than 46 percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch particle size control section. Zoe soils have higher soluble salt concentrations and 4 to 8 millimhos/cm electrical conductivity below a depth of 12 inches. Zook soils have less than 30 percent sand in the lower one fourth of the series control section."

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 32 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 145 to 170 days. Elevation ranges from 1,000 to 1,250 feet above sea level."

The moderately well drained Erin and Kilkenny soils are on shoulder and backslope positions. The somewhat poorly drained Lerdal soils are on summits and gently sloping backslopes. The poorly drained Mazaska and Shields soils are on summits and swales. The very poorly drained Okoboji soils formed in similar sediment as Derrynane and are in closed depressions. The very poorly drained Rolfe soils are in slightly concave depressions on summits."
