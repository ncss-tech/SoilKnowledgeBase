  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to 60 inches thick. Depth to calcium carbonates ranges from 40 to 80 inches. The 10 to 40 inch particle size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay. A clay increase is typical in the B horizons but the B/A clay ratio is less than 1.2. The mantle of colluvial and glacio-lacustrine sediment typically ranges from 30 to 50 inches but some pedons range as thick as 70 inches. The lacustrine mantle typically does not have coarse fragments, but may contain up to 2 percent coarse fragments in some pedons. The underlying glacial till contains 2 to 8 percent coarse fragments, by volume, of mixed lithology. The sand content ranges from 30 to 45 percent and the clay content ranges from 18 to 32 percent in the glacial till.\nThe Ap and A horizons have a hue of 10YR or are neutral, value of 2 in the upper part and 2 or 3 in the lower part, with a chroma of 0 to 2. They are silty clay loam, clay loam or silty clay. Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bg or Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, values of 2 or 3 in the upper part, 4 in the lower part, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silty clay loam, clay loam or silty clay. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons may have a Bkg horizon.\nThe 2Bg or 2Btg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loam or clay loam. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2BCg horizon has a hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 1 to 3. It is loam or clay loam. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2Cg has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loam or clay loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Clamo, Okoboji, Wabash, Zoe and Zook series. Clamo soils have free carbonates within 30 inches. Okoboji soils are saturated in the upper one fourth of the series control section for more than half of the 120 days following the summer solstice in an undrained condition. Wabash soils average more than 46 percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch particle size control section. Zoe soils have higher soluble salt concentrations and 4 to 8 millimhos/cm electrical conductivity below a depth of 12 inches. Zook soils have less than 30 percent sand in the lower one fourth of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Derrynane soils are on plane to slightly concave positions on footslopes or toeslopes on moraines. Slopes range from 1 to 4 percent. They formed in 30 to 50 inches of silty and/or clayey colluvium and glacio-lacustrine sediment and the underlying calcareous, loamy, friable glacial till of Late Wisconsin age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 32 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 145 to 170 days. Elevation ranges from 1,000 to 1,250 feet above sea level."

The moderately well drained Erin and Kilkenny soils are on shoulder and backslope positions. The somewhat poorly drained Lerdal soils are on summits and gently sloping backslopes. The poorly drained Mazaska and Shields soils are on summits and swales. The very poorly drained Okoboji soils formed in similar sediment as Derrynane and are in closed depressions. The very poorly drained Rolfe soils are in slightly concave depressions on summits."
