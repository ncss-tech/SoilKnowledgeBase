Bajura and Coloso soils are on lower positions and have more clay in the control section.  In addition, Bajura soils are poorly drained and Coloso soils are somewhat poorly drained.  The excessively drained Reilly soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and have less clay in the control section.  Toa soils are on slightly lower positions, have more clay in the control section, and are Mollisols."
