  "OVERVIEW": "The Dique series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on flood plains of the Humid Coastal Plains MLRA.  They formed in alluvial deposits of mixed origin.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 57 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

The excessively drained Reilly soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and have less clay in the control section.  Toa soils are on slightly lower positions, have more clay in the control section, and are Mollisols."
