  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to sandstone ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The average annual soil temperature ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days during summer and fall. The upper 7 to 12 inches has an estimated volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, 15-bar moisture content of 10 to 12 percent, and moist bulk density of 0.85 to 1.0 g/cc. The exchange complex is estimated to be dominated by amorphous material in the particle-size control section.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. The 2Bw1 horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist. It averages 40 to 50 percent rock fragments and 5 to 15 percent sandstone parafragments. Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe 2Bw2 horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry, 3 or 6 moist. Texture is very stony or very cobbly sandy loam.  It averages 50 to 65 percent rock fragments and 20 to 35 percent sandstone parafragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Deroux soils are on mountain sides and have slopes of 30 to 90 percent. They formed in colluvium and residuum from Swauk sandstone with an admixture of volcanic ash. Elevations are 3,400 to 5,800 feet. The soils are in a continental climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 65 inches. The mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The growing season at 28 degrees F is 145 to 170 days."
