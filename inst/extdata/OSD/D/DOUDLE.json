Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges\nfrom 40 to 60 percent.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown to reddish brown in hue of\n5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 through 4.\nPedons with moist values and chromas less than 3.5 have A\nhorizons less than 7 inches thick.  Texture is cobbly loam,\ncobbly very fine sandy loam, or cobbly silt loam.  Reaction\nranges from mildly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizons are brown to light reddish brown in hue of\n5YR through 10YR, value 5 through 7 and chroma of 2 through\n6.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Brackett, Hext, Karnes,\nSeawillow, Shep, and Weymouth series.  Brackett soils have\nsola less than 20 inches thick.  Hext soils have mixed\nmineralogy.  Karnes soils lack a paralithic contact with\nsandstone within 40 inches depth.  Seawillow and Shep soils\nhave fine-loamy control sections and lack a paralithic\ncontact with sandstone within 40 inches depth.  Weymouth\nsoils have fine-loamy control sections and mixed mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Doudle soils are on gently sloping to\nstrongly sloping low ridges and knolls of the uplands.\nSlopes are dominantly less than 5 percent but range from 1\nto 12 percent.  The soils developed in weakly consolidated, calcareous, sandstones and loamy earths, locally called Pink Sandstone and Pink Caliche.  The unique formation is thought\nto be a basal member of Lower Cretaceous Age.  At the type\nlocation, the mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches,\nmean annual temperature about 65 degrees F., and\nThornthwaite annual P-E index is about 40."

Bolar soils have mollic\nepipedons and fine-loamy control sections.  Menard and\nPedernales soils have argillic horizons, and in addition,\nPedernales soils have more than 35 percent clay in the\ncontrol section.  Real soils have mollic epipedons and have\nsola less than 20 inches thick."
