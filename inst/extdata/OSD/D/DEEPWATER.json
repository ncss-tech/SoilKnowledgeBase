  "OVERVIEW": "The Deepwater series consists of deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in a thin loess mantle and underlying residuum from shales.  Slope ranges from 1 to 10 percent, but typically are less than 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).  Mean annual precipitation is about 1020 mm (40 inches).",
