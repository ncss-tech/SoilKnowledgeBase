The seasonal snowfall is 24 to 36 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F., mean January temperature is 34 to 38 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 68 to 71 degrees F.

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 2 and 3 feet (moderately deep free water occurrence class) from February through June.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  The water table fluctuates between 3 and 5 feet from July through January.  Drained phases exist with endosaturation between 3 and 5 feet from February through June.  These soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for brief periods between December and May or rare flooding for brief periods year-round."
