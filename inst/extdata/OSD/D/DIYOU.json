  "OVERVIEW": "The Diyou series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Diyou soils are on flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
