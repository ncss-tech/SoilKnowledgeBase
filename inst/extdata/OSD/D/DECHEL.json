  "OVERVIEW": "The Dechel series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils on swamps, marshes, backswamps, and flood plains of valley floors located on volcanic islands. These soils formed in formed in organic deposits and alluvial sediments derived from basalt, andesite, dacite, marine deposits, volcanic breccias, tuff, bedded tuff, or schist. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the subsoil and in the underlying material.  Slope is 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual rainfall is about 3685 millimeters (145 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 27 C (81 F).",

These soils formed in formed in organic deposits and alluvial sediments derived from basalt, andesite, dacite, marine deposits, volcanic breccias, tuff, bedded tuff, or schist Elevation is 0 to 67 meters (0 to 220 feet.) Depth to the water table ranges from 10 centimeters (4 inches) above mineral soil surface to about 25 centimeters (10 inches) below. The soils are flooded frequently for extremely brief periods and ponded frequently for very long periods all months of the year. The climate is tropical and moist. Because of the strong marine influence, the diurnal and annual range of temperature is limited. Rainfall averages about 3685 millimeters (145 inches) per year and ranges from approximately 2900 to 4400 mm (114 to 173 in.) The seasonal wet (May to November) and dry seasons (December to April) with the driest months (February, March, and April) averaging 178 to 229 milliliters (7 to 9 inches) per month. Rainfall is derived from convective uplift, which results in short duration rainstorms of high intensity. Rainfall is irregularly distributed geographically. These soils lie within the latitudinal zone that receives more solar radiation than it re-radiates back to space. This imbalance maintains the atmospheric temperatures in a quasi-steady state. The mean daily temperature throughout the year averages 27 C (81 F) with a mean diurnal range of about 4 C (7 F.) Relative humidity averages about 90 percent at night and 75 to 80 percent during the day."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Dechel series had an O horizon when originally mapped in 1980 but due to changes in management practices such as; drainage ditches, fluctuating water table, lack of organic inputs, and turning over the soil. Over time, the organic matter has been oxidized and removed from the system. Now much of the Dechel series with O horizons can only be found in native vegetation. Dechel soils that formed in alluvium derived from soils that formed from schist typically have a higher pH value and base status than Dechel soils derived from soils on volcanic parent material. Dechel soils in Yap are classified as Fluvaquents and derived from schist. These soils have a high water table, are susceptible to subsidence, and have poor engineering properties.\nThe traditional system of agriculture included intensive taro cultivation. The soil is first dug out down to the fresh water lens, tall grasses and sedges, weeds, and young trees are removed or pushed into the mud as fertilizer. The soil is turned over and work, which requires the Palauans to dig down deep as far as they can with their hands and lift the mud and organic matter to turn it over. Wood ashes, twigs, grasses, and leaves are added below the mud to keep insects, fungus, and bacteria away and for fertilizer.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - From the surface to a depth of 10 centimeters (A horizon).\nCambic horizon - from 10 to 109 centimeters (Bg and BCg horizons)\nAquic Conditions - 10 to 200 centimeters\nReduced Matrix - 10 to 200 centimeters\nEndosaturation - 10 to 200 centimeters\nRedox depletions with chroma 2 or less -10 to 200 centimeters\nParticle-size control section - 25 to 100 centimeters\nN value: greater than 0.7\nLithologic discontinuity - 28 and 61 centimeters (61 and 103 inches) (2BCg and 3Cg horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: National Soil Survey Laboratory Data No. S79TQ63910 used to define mineralogy, and Military Geology of Palau Islands, 1956, and Yap Islands, 1960, are used to define the series. Additional data are National Soil Survey Laboratory # 03PW004001 and 07FM060001.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 10th edition 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
