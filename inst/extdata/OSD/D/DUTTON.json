  "OVERVIEW": "The Dutton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine materials or residuum from semiconsolidated shale or interbedded shale and sandstone.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
