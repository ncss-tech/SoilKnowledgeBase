These soils formed in lacustrine materials or in residuum from semiconsolidated shale or interbedded shale and sandstone.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; and short, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 105 to 135 days."
