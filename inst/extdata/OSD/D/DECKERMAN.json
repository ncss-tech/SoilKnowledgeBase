    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Deckerman soils are on lake plains and flood plains.  They formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 4,300 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid with a mean annual precipitation of 13 to 15 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 51 to 53 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 65 to 79 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 180 days."

Some areas are used industrial sites and urban development.  The native vegetation in rangeland is mainly inland saltgrass, alkali sacaton, black greasewood, and basin wildrye."
