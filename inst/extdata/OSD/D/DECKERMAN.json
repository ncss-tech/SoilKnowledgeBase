  "OVERVIEW": "The Deckerman series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Deckerman soils are on lake plains and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
