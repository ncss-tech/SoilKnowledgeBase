  "OVERVIEW": "The Demotte series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapid permeable soils that formed in alluvium from limestone and dolomite. Demotte soils occur on meadows, and alluvial fans. They have slopes of 0 to 8 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 32 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
