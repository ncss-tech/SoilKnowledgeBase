Jean soils are moist for less than 10 cumulative days between June and August. Kokan soils are moist periodically in the upper part of the control section for more than 20 days cumulative during July through September. Pipecan soils are usually dry, moist in some part during winter and spring and intermittently moist near the soil surface only following occasional summer convection storms."

Elevations are 650 to 933 meters (2,132 to 3,060 feet). The climate is arid with warm, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 175 millimeters (4 to 7 inches); mean annual air temperature is 17 to 20 degrees C (63 to 78 degrees F). The frost-free season is 270 to 320 days."
