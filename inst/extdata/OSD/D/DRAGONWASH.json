  "OVERVIEW": "The Dragonwash series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed igneous and metamorphic sources. Dragonwash soils are on drainageways. Slopes range from 2 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 138 millimeters (5.5 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 18.5 degrees C (65 degrees F).",
