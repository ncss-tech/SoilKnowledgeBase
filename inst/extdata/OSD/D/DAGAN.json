Sandstone or conglomerate is at a depth of 40 to 60 inches or more.  The mean annual soil temperature is 36 to 44 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.  The soil is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 or more consecutive days within the 4 months following the summer solstice.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of  2 through 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  It commonly is gravelly loam or gravelly silt loam, and less commonly very stony loam.  Rock fragments range from 25 to 65 percent, with 20 to 55 percent as pebbles, 0 to 30 percent as cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent as stones.  The A horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry and 3 through 6 moist.  It commonly is very gravelly loam and less commonly very cobbly loam or extremely gravelly silt loam.  Rock fragments range from 50 to 75 percent, with 40 to 70 percent as pebbles and 0 to 35 percent as cobbles.  The Bw horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline, and slightly calcareous to strongly calcareous.\nThe Bk and C horizons have hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 8 dry and 4 through 6 moist. Texture is commonly extremely gravelly silt loam or extremely gravelly loam and less commonly cobbly sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 65 to 80 percent, 20 to 80 percent pebbles and 0 to 60  percent cobbles.  The C horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
