  "OVERVIEW": "The Ducklake series consists of deep, well drained soils on glaciated slopes of mountains. Ducklake soils are formed in volcanic ash overlying glacial till from granite. Slopes are 5 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 57 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
