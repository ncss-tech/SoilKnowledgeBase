  "OVERVIEW": "The Deerhorn series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in aeolian deposits reworked by water over basalt.  Deerhorn soils are on basalt plains and buttes and have a slope of 0 to 15 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
