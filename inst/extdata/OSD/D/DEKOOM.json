  "OVERVIEW": "The Dekoom series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from limestone, dolomite, and calcareous shale.  Dekoom soils are on side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
