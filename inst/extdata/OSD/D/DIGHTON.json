  "OVERVIEW": "The Dighton series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy and clayey materials over sandy deposits on till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 2 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",
