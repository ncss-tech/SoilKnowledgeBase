    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Current competitors are the Betonnie, Bijou, Gilcrest, Khapo, Neesopah, Terro, Tintero, and Vonalee series.  Betonnie and Bijou have no visible carbonates in the control section.  Bijou and Khapo have granitic parent materials.  Neesopah and Tintero have higher carbonates in the Bk horizons and should be reclassified as Calciargids. Terro soils have lithic or paralithic contacts at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Tintero and Vonalee have yellower hues in the control section."
