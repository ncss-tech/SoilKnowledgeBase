  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum ranges from 24 to 45 inches. Bedrock is deeper than 60 inches. Depth to carbonates ranges from 25 to 72 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent throughout.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam. It has weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure. It is very friable or friable. Reaction is moderately acid through neutral.\nSome pedons have an E horizon that have hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam. Reaction is strongly acid through neutral.\nThe B/E horizon has colors and textures similar to the B and E horizons. The E part (albic material) must constitute 15 percent or more by volume of the horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 3 or 4 above 30 inches, and chroma of 2 through 4 below 30 inches. It is silt loam or silty clay loam and some pedons have layers which range from fine sandy loam to silty clay. Redoximorphic features range from few to many and are low and high chroma. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral in the upper part and slightly acid through slightly alkaline in the lower part.\nSome pedons have a CB horizon that has color, texture, and reaction characteristics that are mixtures of the overlying Bt and underlying C horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 8. It ranges from silty clay loam to stratified silt and very fine sand. Loamy till is at depths of 3.5 to 6 feet in some pedons. Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Depeyster soils are nearly level to very steep soils on glacial lake plains, intermontane valleys, and on till plains that have moderately thick mantles of lake sediments. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. The soils formed in calcareous water-laid silt, clay, and very fine sand. Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 50 inches. The growing season (frost-free) ranges from 100 to 150 days. The range in elevation is 300 to 2000 feet."

The Hailesboro and Matoon soils have aquic moisture regimes and are on lower topographic positions than Depeyster soils. Heuvelton soils are on similar topographic positions as Depeyster soils but have a fine textured argillic horizon."

Active CEC class assigned based on lab data from S81NY-089-8.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 7 inches (Ap and E horizon).\nb. Glossic horizon - the zone from 7 to 13 inches (Bt/E horizon).\nc. Argillic horizon - the zone from 7 to 25 inches (Bt/E, Bt1, and Bt2 horizon).\nd. Aquic feature - mottles with chroma of 2 or less are in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data is available for pedon: S81NY-089-8-(1-5).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
