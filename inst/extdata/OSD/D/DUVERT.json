  "OVERVIEW": "The Duvert series consists of soils that are moderately deep to soft shale.  They are well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey marine sediments.  These very gently sloping to moderately sloping soils occur on uplands.  Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",
