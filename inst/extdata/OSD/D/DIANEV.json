These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, including limestone, chert, dolostone, and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevation are 1,740 to 2,190 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
