  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Dianev series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks including limestone, chert, dolostone, and volcanic ash.  Dianev soils are on flood plains and low lake plain terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
