  "OVERVIEW": "The Disterheff series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium, colluvium and residuum.  Disterheff soils are on plateaus and mesas and have slopes of 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
