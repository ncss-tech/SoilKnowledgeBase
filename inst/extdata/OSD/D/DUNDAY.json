Typical Pedon: added roots and changed structure based on the original pedon description which was populated in NASIS in 3/2006.Range in Characteristics: added loamy sand texture to the ranges in A and AC horizons. Geographic Setting: revised landscape/landform terminology. Use and Vegetation: revised. Distribution and Extent: added LRR and MLRA.\n9/2006 RRH: Geographically Associated Soils: deleted Doger, Duda, Els, Elsmere, Gannett, Hersh, Loup, Pivot, Simeon, and Tryon soils which are not associated soils at the type location and added Mullen (T) soils which also is an associated soil at the type location.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data is available from the Soil Survey Laboratory of the National Soil Survey Center for Site ID 76NE089001, 80NE017001, and 92NE031006.
