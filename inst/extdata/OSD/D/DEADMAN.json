  "OVERVIEW": "The Deadman series consists of deep, well or somewhat excessively drained soils formed in material weathered from dioritic rock.  Deadman soils are on broad ridges and mountain sideslopes and have slopes of 20 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 70 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 45 degrees F, mean summer soil temperature is 48 degrees F.\nThe soil between the depths of 8 to 24 inches is usually dry in all parts from mid-July to mid-October, and moist in all parts from November to April.  The base saturation by Hach kit, in the epipedon is about 25 to 30 percent.  The profile is slightly to strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 3/3.  It is loam or sandy loam, with 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe B horizon is 10YR 4/3, 5/4; 2.5Y 6/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2, 4/4; 2.5Y 4/4.  It is loam or sandy loam with 5 to 30 percent gravel.\nIn some pedons the C horizon is 10YR 5/4, 6/4, 5/6.  Moist color is 10YR 3/4 or 7.5YR 4/4.  It is loam, loamy sand or sandy loam with 20 to 35 percent gravel."
