    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to diorite ranges from 100 to more than 150cm.  The mean annual soil temperature is 45 degrees F, mean summer soil temperature is 48 degrees F.\nThe soil between the depths of 8 to 24 inches is usually dry in all parts from mid-July to mid-October, and moist in all parts from November to April.  The base saturation by Hach kit, in the epipedon is about 25 to 30 percent.  The profile is slightly to strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 3/3.  It is loam or sandy loam, with 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe B horizon is 10YR 4/3, 5/4; 2.5Y 6/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2, 4/4; 2.5Y 4/4.  It is loam or sandy loam with 5 to 30 percent gravel.\nIn some pedons the C horizon is 10YR 5/4, 6/4, 5/6.  Moist color is 10YR 3/4 or 7.5YR 4/4.  It is loam, loamy sand or sandy loam with 20 to 35 percent gravel."

Elevations are 4,500 to 6,500 feet.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation varies from 65 to 80 inches.  Mean January temperature is 43 degrees F, mean July temperature is 65 degrees F, and mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F.  Frost-free season is estimated to be 80 to 140 days."
