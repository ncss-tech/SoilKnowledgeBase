Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 3,200 to 4,700 feet.  The climate is hot and dry in the summer with infrequent convection storms between May and October.  The winters are cool with common rain showers between December and April.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 to 9 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 57 to 61 degrees F.  The frost- free season is about 190 to 210 days."
