  "OVERVIEW": "The Dedas series consists of shallow over a duripan well drained soils underlain by bedrock.  Dedas soils are on summits and sideslopes of rock pediment remnants.  Dedas soils formed in residuum from tuff overlain by mixed pedisediments.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
