The plant community for fine sandy loams is short and mid grasses with a lesser tall grass component, mid grasses tend to dominate this site.  The main plant species are sideoats grama, blue grama, and little bluestem, with minor amounts of Indiangrass, vine mesquite, sand dropseed, buffalograss, gauras, catclaw sensitive briar, prairie clover, and sagewort.  Woody plants include catclaw acacia and yucca.  The plant community for fine sands and loamy fine sands is tall and mid grasses with tall grasses tending to dominate.  The major plant species include little bluestem, sand bluestem, sand lovegrass, sand paspalum, and sideoats grama with minor amounts of silver bluestem, sand dropseed, hooded windmillgrass, fall witchgrass, hairy grama, and perennial threeawn.  Woody plants comprise 10 to 20 percent of the plant community and include sand shinoak, sand sagebrush, and skunkbush. This soil has been correlated to the Sandy Loam (R077BY021TX) and Sandy (R077BY658TX) ecological site in MLRA-77B."
