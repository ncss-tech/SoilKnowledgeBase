  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Soil depth ranges from 40 to 60 inches over sandstone bedrock.  Secondary calcium carbonate is at depths below 35 inches. Siliceous pebbles and fragments of sandstone comprise 0 to 15 percent of the surface and control section and 0 to 25 percent of the B3 horizon. Sandstone fragments may occur as pebble or cobble bands in the B horizons of some pedons.\nThe A horizon ranges from brown or reddish brown to light brown or yellowish red in hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, and 5YR with value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 8.  Texture is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam to loamy fine sand.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon ranges from red or reddish brown to yellowish red or reddish yellow in hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR with value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 8. The zone of maximum clay accumulation is of reddish color. Texture ranges from very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam to sandy clay loam with average clay content of 18 to 34 percent.  It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline in the upper part and slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part.\nThe Bt4 horizon has colors that are 1 or 2 units higher in value and chroma. It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon is weakly to moderately cemented sandstone bedrock or soft sandstone bedrock that slakes in water.  Some pedons have Cr/C horizons of sandstone bedrock interbedded with reddish to yellowish sandy clay loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or soft siltstone. Some Cr horizons contain strata and masses of strongly cemented sandstone or ironstone.  The soil may have a weakly to moderately expressed Crk horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the similar Brennan, Brystal, Comitas, Hebbronville, Menard, and Rochelle series. Brennan and Brystal soils have secondary calcium carbonate at depths of less than 36 inches and mixed mineralogy.  Comitas soils have sandy epipedons more than 20 inches thick.  Hebbronville soils have less than 18 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon.  Menard and Rochelle soils have mean annual soil temperatures less than 72 degrees F, and are moist in the moisture control section for longer periods."

The soil formed in loamy residuum from interbedded sandstone and siltstone over sandstone bedrock.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 28 inches and mean annual air temperature ranges from 69 to 74 degrees F., Frost free days range from 240 to 320 days and elevation ranges from 450 to 800 feet.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 23 to 36."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly rangeland, but large areas are dry farmed and others are irrigated to peanuts, melons, cotton, grain sorghum, vegetables, and tame pastures.  The original plant community was open grassland, dominated by mid-grasses with scattered shrubs, a few short grasses and about 5 percent perennial forbs.  With retrogression, typical increasers and invaders are mesquite, spiny hackberry, pricklypear, hooded windmillgrass, threeawn, Hall's panicum, red lovegrass, fringed signalgrass, grassbur and annual forbs."
