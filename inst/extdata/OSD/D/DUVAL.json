  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Soil depth ranges from 40 to 60 inches over sandstone bedrock.  Secondary calcium carbonate is at depths below 35 inches. Siliceous pebbles and fragments of sandstone comprise 0 to 15 percent of the surface and control section and 0 to 25 percent of the B3 horizon. Sandstone fragments may occur as pebble or cobble bands in the B horizons of some pedons.\nThe A horizon ranges from brown or reddish brown to light brown or yellowish red in hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, and 5YR with value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 8.  Texture is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam to loamy fine sand.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon ranges from red or reddish brown to yellowish red or reddish yellow in hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR with value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 8. The zone of maximum clay accumulation is of reddish color. Texture ranges from very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam to sandy clay loam with average clay content of 18 to 34 percent.  It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline in the upper part and slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part.\nThe Bt4 horizon has colors that are 1 or 2 units higher in value and chroma. It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon is weakly to moderately cemented sandstone bedrock or soft sandstone bedrock that slakes in water.  Some pedons have Cr/C horizons of sandstone bedrock interbedded with reddish to yellowish sandy clay loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or soft siltstone. Some Cr horizons contain strata and masses of strongly cemented sandstone or ironstone.  The soil may have a weakly to moderately expressed Crk horizon."

The original plant community was open grassland, dominated by mid-grasses with scattered shrubs, a few short grasses and about 5 percent perennial forbs.  With retrogression, typical increasers and invaders are mesquite, spiny hackberry, pricklypear, hooded windmillgrass, threeawn, Hall's panicum, red lovegrass, fringed signalgrass, grassbur and annual forbs."
