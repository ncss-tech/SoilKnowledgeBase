    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness ranges from 40 to about 80 inches.  Depth to a subhorizon with more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium ranges from 16 to 32 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or silt.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam or silt.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.  Tongues of E material extend to a depth of 25 to 45 inches.\nSome pedons have E/B or B/E horizons that are mottled in shades of grayish brown or are grayish brown (10YR 5/2) or light grayish brown (10YR 6/2).\nInteriors of peds in the Btn1 horizon have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Mottles are in shades of gray or brown.  Interiors of peds in the Btn2 horizon have colors similar to the Btn1 horizon or they have chroma of 2 in values of 4 to 6.  Exteriors of peds in the Btn horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Btn horizons are silty clay loam or silt loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid in the upper part and from neutral to moderately alkaline in the lower part.\nThe BCn and C horizons have colors similar to those of the Btn horizon.  Mottles are in shades of brown or gray.  Texture is sandy clay loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from neutral through moderately alkaline.

Bonn, Hillemann, Lafe, and Verdun soils have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium throughout the argillic horizon.  Hillemann soils have lower chroma in the upper part of the B horizon and are acid throughout.  Egypt, Essen, Fred, Gibert, and Patoutville soils do not have natric horizons.  Foley and Peoria soils have colors of lower chroma in the upper Bt horizons.  Peoria soils also have A horizons that are more than 20 inches thick.  McCrory and Rosella soils have fine-loamy textures."
