  "OVERVIEW": "The Dixaleta series consists of very shallow, well drained soils developed in alluvium and colluvium from schist.  Dixaleta soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 5 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 68 degrees F.",
