These soils formed in loess and volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed rocks, including igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,280 to 1,770 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
