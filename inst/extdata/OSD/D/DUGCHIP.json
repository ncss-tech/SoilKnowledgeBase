  "OVERVIEW": "The Dugchip series consists of moderately deep to duripan, well drained soils that formed in loess and volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  The Dugchip soils are on fan piedmont remnants. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
