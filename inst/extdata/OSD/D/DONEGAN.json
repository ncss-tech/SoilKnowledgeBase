The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to a paralithic contact and thickness of the umbric epipedon is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 50 percent gravel, and 15 to 40 percent cobbles.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 10 to 40 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It has 20 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 60 percent gravel, and 10 to 40 percent cobbles.  It is a very cobbly loam, extremely gravelly loam, extremely gravelly clay loam, or very gravelly clay loam."

Brandypeak soils have a 10 to 14 inch thick umbric epipedon. Burnlake soils are very deep and have a 10 to 20 inch thick umbric epipedon. Freezeout soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle size control section and have a 10 to 20 inch thick umbric epipedon. Goodwin soils are deep to a paralithic contact. Nanny soils are very deep. Snowbrier soils have hues of 10YR to 5Y, have a 10 to 20 inch thick umbric epipedon and are dominated by schist rock fragments. Tallac soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a cemented or compacted layer. Undusk soils are very deep."
