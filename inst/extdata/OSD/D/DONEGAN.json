  "OVERVIEW": "The Donegan series consists of moderately deep, well drained\nsoils that formed in colluvium weathered from igneous rock and volcanic ash.  Donegan soils are on ridges and hillslopes and have slopes of 3 to 65 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches.",

The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to a paralithic contact and thickness of the umbric epipedon is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 50 percent gravel, and 15 to 40 percent cobbles.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 10 to 40 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It has 20 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 60 percent gravel, and 10 to 40 percent cobbles.  It is a very cobbly loam, extremely gravelly loam, extremely gravelly clay loam, or very gravelly clay loam."
