  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments are dominantly channers or gravels and range from 5 to 35 percent in the solum and from 15 to 45 percent in the substratum.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum and from strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum. A stony phase of the Dutchess series is recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, silt loam, or their gravelly or channery analogs. Some pedons have an Ap horizon, 6 to 10 inches thick.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2.  It is loam, silt loam or their gravelly or channery analogs.\nThe upper part of the B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 6.  The lower part of the B horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 6.  The B horizon is loam, silt loam or their channery or gravelly analogs.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 through 4.   It is channery, very channery, gravelly or very gravelly silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam."

Ashe, Cardigan, Chatfield, Ditney, Hazel, Lordstown, Morrowbone, Steinsburg and Yalesville soils have bedrock within 40 inches of the surface. Bernardston, Broadbrook, Montauk, Nantucket, Newport, Paxton, Scituate and Wethersfield soils are underlain by dense till within a depth of 40 inches of the surface.  Brookfield soils are 5YR or redder in the upper part of the B horizon.  Buladean soils have coarse fragments which are dominated by felsic crystalline rock such as gneiss and granitoids. Chadakoin and Franklinville soils have coarse fragments which are dominated by sandstone, siltstone, and shale.  Rock fragments in the Charlton soils are dominantly gravel size schist, granite, or gneiss. Cheshire and Maplecrest soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the B and C horizon.  Chestnut soils have weathered granite gneiss within 40 inches of the surface.  Edneyville and Stecoah soils have saprolite within 40 inches of the surface.  Fedscreek and Maymead soils have a solum greater then 40 inches thick.  Pollux soils have less than 10 percent rock fragments throughout the soil. Riverhead soils have stratified sand and gravel C horizons within a depth of 40 inches.  Satsop soils lack rock fragments in the control section. Soco soils have weathered phyllite within 40 inches of the surface. St. Albans soils have textures ranging from coarse sandy loam to fine sandy loam in the B horizons.  Valois soils have a 30 to 70 inch solum and have rock fragments which are dominantly sandstone, siltstone, or shale."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dutchess soils are level to very steep soils on glaciated uplands.  They are on broad plains and on the tops and side slopes of hills, ridges, knolls and mounds.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  The soils formed in loamy glacial till underlain by interbedded, folded phyllite and slate, schist, or shale.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees Fahrenheit.  The frost free season ranges from 120 to 180 days. Elevations range from 50 to 1000 feet above mean sea level."
