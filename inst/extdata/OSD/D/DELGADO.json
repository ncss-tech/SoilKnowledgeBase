Langwell soils (MLRA 30), on mountains, hills and pediments,  are moist in some part for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October following convection storms and have surface rock fragments. Splanod soils (MLRA 35), on mesas and structural benches in the Grand Canyon, are intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and have color hue of 2.5YR or 5YR. Tidwell soils (MLRA 41), on plateaus and mesas, are intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during June - September and have color hue of 7.5YR or 10YR. Trigger soils (MLRA 30), on uplands, are at elevations of 2,400 to 3,800 feet, receive 3 to 7 inches mean annual precipitation, have soil temperatures that less than 47 degrees F. during part of the year and only have color hue of 10YR."
