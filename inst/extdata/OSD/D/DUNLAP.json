  "OVERVIEW": "The Dunlap series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from weakly consolidated, coarse grained sandstone.  These soils occur on low hills.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
