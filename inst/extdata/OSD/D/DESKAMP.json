The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F. Depth to basalt bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The soil has a field estimated average clay content of about 0 to 5 percent. It has a phosphate retention of 15 to 25 percent, acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half of the acid oxalate iron of 0.4 to 0.7 percent and glass plus glass aggregate of 30 to 60 percent and 15-bar water content of 5 to 7 percent on dried samples.\nThe A and AB horizons have color value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist with chroma of 2 or 3 dry and 1 to 3 moist. It is loamy sand and sandy loam. It has 0 to 5 percent gravel.\nThe 2B horizon is loamy sand and gravelly loamy sand. It has 10 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles. Total rock fragment content is 10 to 30 percent. It contains 0 to 10 percent weakly cemented (silica) nodules that are friable when moist. It is neutral or slightly alkaline."
