  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to more than 60 inches.  The dry soil cracks 0.5 to 1 inch wide from the surface to depths of 20 to 30 inches.  COLE range from 0.07 to\n0.14.  The clay content of the 10- to 40-inch control section\nranges from 35 to 55 percent.\nThe A horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dark brown, (10YR 4/3, 3/3), or brown (7.5YR 5/2, 4/2; 10YR 5/3).  It is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline.  Some pedons are calcareous.\nThe C horizon is dark brown to light brown or pale brown in hues\nof 7.5YR or 10YR with values of 3 to 6 and chromas of 2 through 4.  It is silty clay loam, clay, or clay loam and may contain strata\nof loam, clay loam, fine sandy loam, or fine sand below 40 inches.  Some pedons are calcareous and contain films and threads of\ncalcium carbonate, mostly below 40 inches.  Some pedons have B2 horizons up to 18 inches thick that are similar in color and\ntexture to the C horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Roetex series and the similar Behring, Miller and Krum series.  Roetex soils have colors redder than hues of 10YR and have mottles due to wetness.  Behring soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy and have developed over shaly\nclay.  Krum soils have a regular decrease in organic matter and\noccur in uplands."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on nearly level flood plains.  The soil formed in neutral or alkaline loamy and clayey alluvial sediments.  Slopes are dominantly less than 1 percent but some\nshort slopes are as much as 2 percent.  Flooding occurs at\nintervals ranging from 1 or more times a year to once every 4 to\n10 years unless protected.  Mean annual temperature is 62 degrees\nto 70 degrees F., mean annual precipitaion is 27 to 35 inches, and Thornthwaite annual P-E indices are 40 to 54."
