  "REVDATE": "05/2016",
  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Downeyville series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Downeyville soils are on hills, mountains, rock pediments, plateaus, and mesas.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Etinarg, Hoot, Mirkwood, Theon, Tognoni, Valleycity, Vium, and Waucoba series.\nEtinarg soils have 35 to 65 percent fine granite gravel in the particle-size control section and do not have identifiable secondary carbonates.  Hoot soils are noncalcareous throughout the profile and have a neutral reaction class in the argillic horizon.  Mirkwood soils have 25 to 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Theon soils have 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are noncalcareous.  Tognoni soils have more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Valleycity soils contain mainly stones and cobbles in the particle-size control section which are fragments of calcareous sandstone.  Vium soils are dry between July and October, have 10 to 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon, and contain rock fragments of granite.  Waucoba soils are 36 to 50 cm deep to bedrock."
