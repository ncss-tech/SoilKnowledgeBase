Deshler soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock and are dry 45 to 70 consecutive days.  Deter soils are dry 90 to 110 consecutive days, have a solum thickness greater than 60 inches and lack a duripan.  Geoconda soils are calcareous in the Bt horizons, have solum thickness greater than 40 inches, lack a duripan and are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days.  Jacknife soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section for more than 90 days when the soil temperature is above 47 degrees F., are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days and have cobbly clay or cobbly clay loam argillic horizons with more than 15 percent rock fragments.  Medford soils have soil temperature of 54 to 57 degrees F. and are dry 45 to 80 consecutive days and have a solum 40 to 60 inches thick.  Mindego soils have a soil temperature of 55 degrees F.  or warmer, have a comparatively small summer-winter (9 degrees F. to 11 degrees F.) temperature change and are slightly acid or neutral.  Nebeker soils are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days, are medium acid to neutral in the solum and have a solum that ranges from 40 to 60 inches thick."
