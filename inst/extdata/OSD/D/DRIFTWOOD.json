Permeability is slow.   The potential for surface water runoff is negligible.  The soil is subject to frequent, brief periods of flooding. An intermittent apparent seasonal high water table ranges from a depth of 30 cm (12 inches) above the soil surface to 30 cm (12 inches) below the soil surface from December through April in a normal year."
