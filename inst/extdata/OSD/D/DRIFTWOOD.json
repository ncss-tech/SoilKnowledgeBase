    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Mean annual precipitation is about 965 to 1118 mm (38 to 44 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F).  Frost free period is 170 to 190 days, and elevation ranges from 530 to 550 meters (1739 to 1804 feet) above mean sea level."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low or moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers/s).  Permeability is slow.   The potential for surface water runoff is negligible.  The soil is subject to frequent, brief periods of flooding. An intermittent apparent seasonal high water table ranges from a depth of 30 cm (12 inches) above the soil surface to 30 cm (12 inches) below the soil surface from December through April in a normal year."
