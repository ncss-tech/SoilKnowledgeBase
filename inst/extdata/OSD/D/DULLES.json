  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 22 to 48 inches.  Depth to dense weathered bedrock (Cr horizon) ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to hard red, fine grained sandstone, siltstone or shale bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches and is quite variable over short horizontal distances.  Coarse fragments of subrounded quartz range from 0 to 5 percent in the A and upper part of the B horizon.  Coarse fragments of soft to relatively hard red and reddish-brown, fine grained sandstone, siltstone and shale range from 5 to 50 percent below the lithologic discontinuity.  Coarse fragments of hard residual red, fine grained sandstone, siltstone and shale range from 25 to 60 percent in the C horizon where present.  The soil is very strongly acid through moderately acid.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 6.  The Ap horizon is a silt loam.  Where present, Al horizons are similar to the Ap horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe 2Bt has hue of 10R through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 3 through 8.  The texture is silty clay or clay.\nThe 2Btg or 2BtCg has hue of 10R through 10YR, value of 3 through 6 and chroma of 0 through 2.  The texture is silty clay or clay.\nIn most pedons the B horizon rests directly on a Cr horizon.  Where present, C horizons are thin transitional zones of clayey gravel composed of thick weak red, pinkish gray, gray and greenish gray clay flows and variably weathered red siltstone and shale."

The Kelly soils have chroma of less than 4 in the Bt horizon and are formed from weathered gray shale.\nThe Iredell and Jackland soils are in closely related families.  The Iredell and Jackland soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dulles soils are on broad nearly level uplands, and concave lowlands such as toeslopes and heads of drainageways in Triassic-Jurassic Basins of the Northern Piedmont Plateau.  Slope gradients are typically 0 to 4 percent.  The soils formed in slope creep and in residuum from red, fine grained sandstone, siltstone and shale.  The source of the colluvium is Pleistocene aged mass wastage of old alluvial cappings and residual red bedrock materials.  Elevations range from 180 to 300 ft.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F and mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 44 inches."
