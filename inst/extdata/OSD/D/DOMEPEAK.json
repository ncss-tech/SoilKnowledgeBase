  "OVERVIEW": "The Domepeak series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Domepeak soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
