  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 50 to more than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Moist values are less than 3.5. Texture is loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, gray, red and yellow range from common to many.  Most pedons have dark gray or very dark gray coatings on the exteriors of peds in this horizon.  Texture is clay loam or sandy clay.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, gray and red range from few to many. Some pedons have a mottled matrix in shades of yellow, brown, gray and red.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay.  Average clay content of the control section ranges from 35 to 45 percent.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the upper Bt horizon and from medium acid to moderately alkaline in the lower Bt horizon.  Some pedons contain masses and concretions of calcium carbonate below 36 inches.\nThe BC horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid in the upper part to moderately alkaline in the lower part.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, gray or red range from none to common.  Some pedons have a mottled matrix in shades of yellow, brown, gray and red.  These redoximorphic features are considered to be relict.\nThe C horizon is loamy sand, fine sandy loam, sandy clay or sandy clay loam. Some pedons contain interbedded layers of weakly consolidated packsand or weakly cemented sandstone.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Elmendorf, Hallettsville, and Straber series.  Elmendorf soils have mean annual soil temperatures greater than 72 degrees F and along with the Hallettsville series, have vertic properties.  Straber soils lack mollic epipedons and have more acid reaction."

The soil formed in loamy and sandy marine sediments of the Goliad and Fleming Formations of the Pliocene Epoch.  Slopes are smooth to slightly convex.  Slope gradients are dominantly 1 to 3 percent, but range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 40 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 67 to 70 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 260 to 280 days and elevation ranges from 200 to 600 feet.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 44 to 60.."

Carbengle and Cuero soils have loamy control sections and occur at higher elevations on low ridges.  Denhawken soils lack a mollic epipedon and occur in a complex at slightly higher elevations with the Elmendorf soils.  Denhawken, Elmendorf and Hallettsville soils have vertic properties.  Hallettsville soils occur on similar surfaces.  Straber soils occur at higher elevations and lack a mollic epipedon."

Pasture grasses are mainly improved species of bermudagrass and bahiagrass.  A few areas are in cultivation, mainly to corn and hybrid forage sorghums."

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of approximately 17 inches (A and Bt1 horizons).\nAbrupt texture change to clayey Bt at 11 inches.\nArgillic horizon - The zone from approximately 11 to 43 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
