Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, gray, red and yellow range from common to many.  Most pedons have dark gray or very dark gray coatings on the exteriors of peds in this horizon.  Texture is clay loam or sandy clay.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, gray and red range from few to many. Some pedons have a mottled matrix in shades of yellow, brown, gray and red.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay.  Average clay content of the control section ranges from 35 to 45 percent.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the upper Bt horizon and from medium acid to moderately alkaline in the lower Bt horizon.  Some pedons contain masses and concretions of calcium carbonate below 36 inches.\nThe BC horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid in the upper part to moderately alkaline in the lower part.
