  "OVERVIEW": "The Dandan series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on uplifted limestone plateaus.  They formed in sediments overlying porous coralline limestone.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 78 degrees F.",
