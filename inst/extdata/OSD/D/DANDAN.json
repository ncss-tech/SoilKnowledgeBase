    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dandan soils are on uplifted limestone plateaus.  They formed in sediments, possibly volcanic ash, which overlie porous limestone that was part of a coral reef complex.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevation is 30 to 495 feet.  Mean annual temperature is 77 degrees F., with less than 4 degrees F. difference between summer and winter.  Mean annual precipitation is 80 to 90 inches, most of which falls between June and November."
