  "OVERVIEW": "The Dewpoint series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in schist and meta-sedimentary rock from slope alluvium and residuum. Dewpoint soils are on side slopes of interfluves of hills and mountains. The mean annual precipitation is about 305 millimeters (12 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C (64 degrees F). Slopes range from 20 to 55 percent.",

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dewpoint soils formed in schist and meta-sedimentary rock. Typically the parent material is from Catalina schist and associated Franciscan formation meta-sedimentary rock, but may not be restricted to these specific formations. Dewpoint is on side slopes of interfluves of hills and mountains on islands. Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent. Elevations are from sea level to 1550 feet (0 to 472 meters). The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters with potential fog common all year. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 7 to 17 inches (178 to 432 mm), the mean annual temperature is 59 to 66 degrees F. (15 to 19 degrees C.), and the frost free season is 355 to 365 days."
