Depth to slickensides and pressure surfaces range from 15 to 30 inches.  Weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 45 percent.  Calcium carbonate clay in the particle-size control section ranges from 1 to 3 percent.  Linear  extensibility exceeds 6.0 centimeters within 40 inches of the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is clay loam or sandy clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 20 to 30 percent.  Some pedons have few fine concretions of calcium carbonate.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 2 to 20 percent.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt and Btk horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6,  and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam or clay.  Clay content ranges from 30 to 45 percent, but averages greater than 35 percent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 35 percent by weight.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Btkss horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma  of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay loam or clay.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 45 percent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 35 percent by weight.

Clay content ranges from 35 to 50 percent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 40 percent by weight.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nWhere present, the C horizon is weakly consolidated shale that has clay loam or clay texture.  It is mottled and streaked in shades of gray, brown, pink, and yellow.  Some pedons have chroma that are 2 to 3 units higher than the BC horizon.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to  moderately alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Bazette, Denhawken, Grainola, Lexton, Normangee, Ponder, and Wilson series.  Bazette, Grainola, Lexton, Normangee, Ponder, and Wilson soils are in the thermic temperature regime.  In addition, Grainola and Lexton soils have mixed mineralogy.  Denhawken soils have a cambic horizon and a dryer moisture control section.  In  addition, Denhawken soils are associated with the Cook Mountain  Formation."

In native areas this soil occurs as mounds 2 to 8 inches higher than adjoining depressions.  The soil formed in calcareous clayey  materials of the Goliad and Fleming Formations.  Mean annual  precipitation ranges from 38 to 40 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 67 to 70 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 270 to 280  days.  Elevation ranges from 200 to 400 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E Index  range from 50 to 60."
