  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (Unless otherwise stated, thickness and depth are measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Thickness of the sandy mantle and depth to clay range from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and to the underlying sandy outwash ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The clay fraction has smectitic mineralogy.  Rock fragments typically are absent but volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 1 percent throughout the pedon. Reaction naturally ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the sandy mantle but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the clayey deposits and in the sandy substratum.\nThe O horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or it is neutral in hue. Value is 2 to 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or the hue is neutral.  Value is 2 to 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with colors like the A horizon.  The A or Ap horizon is sand, loamy sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand or the mucky analogs.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe 2Btg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y or 5G or it is neutral in hue.  Value is 4 to 6 and chroma is 0 or 1.  It is typically clay or silty clay but some pedons have subhorizons of clay loam or silty clay loam.  The weighted average clay content of the argillic horizon ranges from 50 to 80 percent.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together.  It is sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dody soils are on lake plains.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 2 percent.  Dody soils formed in a mantle of sandy outwash or sandy lacustrine deposits over clayey lacustrine deposits underlain by sandy outwash or sandy lacustrine deposits on lake plains or outwash plains.  Mean annual precipitation is 28 to 32 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 39 to 43 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 110 to 130 days.  Elevation ranges from 900 to 1100 feet."

Permeability is moderately rapid or rapid in the sandy mantle, extremely slow to slow in the clayey deposits, and rapid in the underlying sandy substratum.  Dody soils have a perched seasonal high water table from 1 foot above to 1 foot below the surface for long periods at some time from September to June in most years."
