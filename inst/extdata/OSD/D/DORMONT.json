Workers involved in recent Soil Survey updates believe this soil is mainly derived from residuum.  Future MLRA update work on this series will include addressing Dormont where historically mapped in colluvial landform positions.\nPrevious revision: 08/2005-WRK,AWD,ART\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
