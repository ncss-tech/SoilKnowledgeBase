  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Day soils have cracks 5 mm or more that open and close once each year and remain open for 120 to 150 consecutive days (mid-June thru mid-October).   The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 60 to 75 percent clay.  Depth to weathered sediments of the John Day Formation is 40 to over 60 inches. Depth to secondary carbonates typically is 10 to 24 inches but some pedons have carbonates at 2 inches in some pedons. The soils range from neutral to moderately alkaline in the upper part and neutral to strongly alkaline in the AB, Bk, and C horizons.  Color hue throughout the profile is derived from the parent material.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5Y value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 through 6 moist and dry.  It is clay, silty clay, cobbly clay, or silty clay loam with 0 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 30 percent stones.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5YR, 2.5YR or 10R, value of 3 or 4 moist and dry and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  This horizon has weak to strong wedge-shaped or blocky structure and when dry, very coarse irregular prismatic structure or vertical cracking is prominent.  It is clay or silty clay with 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe Bk and C horizon has colors very similar to the AB horizon. It has platy laminated, or wedge-shaped angular blocky structure or the horizon is massive.  It is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  The Bk horizon in some pedons has few to common intersecting slickensides."

The soils formed in old yellowish or reddish clayey calcareous sediments from the John Day Formation. The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and hot dry summers.  The mean summer temperature is 59 degrees to 66 degrees F., mean winter temperature is 31 degrees to 35 degrees F., mean annual temperature is 45 degrees to 54 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. The frost-free period is 50 to 160 days."
