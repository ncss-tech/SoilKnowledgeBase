The solum has a phosphate retention of 15 to 25 percent, 10 to 30 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate, and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron of 0.4 to 0.8 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.   It is neutral to slightly alkaline. The particle-size control section contains 5 to 10 percent clay and 55 to 75 percent sand.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 14 inches thick.  The base saturation is 80 to 100 percent.\nThe A horizon has color value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist with chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 to 4 dry.  It has 0 to 5 percent gravels, 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones.  Total rock fragments is 0 to 10 percent.\nThe 2B horizon has color value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist with chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It contains 0 to 5 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.  Total rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent. It is ashy sandy loam or gravelly ashy sandy loam.  It contains 0 to 15 percent durinodes.  Rock fragments and durinodes have thin opal or lime coatings."
