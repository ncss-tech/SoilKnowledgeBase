    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to fractured unconsolidated volcanic rock ranges from 10 to 16 inches.  Depth to hard consolidated volcanic bedrock ranges from 16 to 25 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral throughout. The combined total of rock fragments in the control section is less than 35 percent by volume.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is clay loam, clay, or their gravelly or cobbly analogs.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is clay loam, clay, or their gravelly or cobbly analogs.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10Yr, value of 3, and chroma of 3.  Texture is loamy sand or their gravelly or cobbly analogs.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of unconsolidated basic volcanic rock and having the same range of colors as the B2 horizon.  It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools, and is rippable by mechanical equipment.\nThe R layer is composed of hard fractured basic volcanic bedrock."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no known series in the same family.  Cramer and Duey soils are in a closely related family.  Cramer soils are on similar positions, have an active CEC activity class, and have redder subsoils.  Duey soils are on similar positions of limestone hills, and are clayey-skeletal."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Descalabrado soils are on side slopes and summits of hills and mountains on the Semiarid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  They formed in residuum and colluvium material of mixed origin overlying basic volcanic rocks.  The climate is semiarid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 45 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 75 to 79 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aguilita, Guayama, Jcana and Juana Diaz series.  Aguilita soils are on similar positions of limestone hills, are deep to soft limestone bedrock, and have carbonatic control sections.  Guayama and Juana Diaz soils are on similar positions but do not have a mollic epipedon.  In addition, Juana Diaz soils weathered from sandstone.  Jacana soils are on adjacent lower positions and are moderately deep to volcanic rock."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 5 inches (Ap horizon).\nCambic horizon - the zone from 5 to 10 inches (Bw horizon).\nParalithic contact - the contact at 10 inches (Cr horizon).\nLithic contact - the contact at 18 inches (R horizon).\nThe original concept of this series was 15 to 35 inches of residuum over volcanic bedrock as mapped by Dr. James Thorp during the first soil survey of St. Croix in 1932.  It was correlated as Lithic Vertic Ustropepts in the 1970 Soil Survey of the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The type location was moved to Lajas, Puerto Rico in the 1965 Soil Survey of Lajas Valley Area.  This series was not correlated in the 2002 Soil Survey Update of the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The classification was updated with the 11/2004 draft from Clayey, mixed, superactive, isohyperthermic Lithic Haplustolls to Clayey, mixed, superactive, isohyperthermic, shallow Typic Haplustolls based on the recognition of a paralithic contact.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization pedon - Lajas Municipality, Puerto Rico; S61PR-121-002.  Sample by NSSL, Lincoln, NE., 03/1961.\nDescalabrado soils are in MLRA 271.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
