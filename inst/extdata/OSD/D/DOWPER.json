  "OVERVIEW": "The Dowper series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a deep volcanic ash mantle over residuum from basalt. They are on hills. Permeability is moderately slow and slopes range from 15 to 40 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 37 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees.",
