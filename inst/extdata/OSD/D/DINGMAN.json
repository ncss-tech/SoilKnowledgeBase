  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The soil between the depths of 7 and 21 inches is dry in all parts from June to October and is moist in all parts from December to May.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 54 degrees to 58 degrees F.  Organic matter to a depth of 20 inches or more is greater than 1 percent.  Base saturation ranges from 50 to 100 percent throughout and is below 75 percent in some part of the upper 30 inches.  The calcium to magnesium ratio is 1:1 or less.  The soil is neutral or mildly alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/2; 7.5YR 4/2, or 5YR 4/2.  Moist colors are 7.5YR 3/2 or 5YR 3/2.  It has 27 to 35 percent clay, 10 to 20 percent cobbles and 10 to 20 percent gravel.\nThe Bt horizon is 7.5YR 4/2; 5YR 3/2 or 4/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/3; 7.5YR 3/2; 5YR 3/2, or 3/3.  It is clay loam or clay with 35 to 55 percent clay, 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 10 to 35 percent gravel.  It averages 35 to 50 percent clay and 20 to 35 percent rock fragments."

Elevations are 1,500 to 3,800 feet.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation varies from 40 to 55 inches.  Mean January temperature is 40 degrees F; mean July temperature is 70 degrees F; mean annual temperature varies from 52 degrees to 57 degrees F.  Frost-free season ranges form 125 to 200 days."
