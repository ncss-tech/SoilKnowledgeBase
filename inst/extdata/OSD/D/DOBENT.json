    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 62 to 68 degrees F. The particle-size control section averages loam but individual horizons are highly variable with strata of loam, clay loam, sandy loam, silty clay loam, silt loam, and very fine sandy loam. Clay averages 18 to 27 percent and sand less than 35 percent coarser than fine sand.\nThe Ap or A horizons have hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, chroma of 2 or less dry and moist. They are loam but strata of clay loam through silt loam occur in some pedons. Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline. EC is normally 4 to 8 mmhos/cm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or less dry and moist in the matrix. Neutral to light gray redox features are also present. Textures are quite variable but average loam. This horizon is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline, and has 4 to 8 mmhos/cm EC."
