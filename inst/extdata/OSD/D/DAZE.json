These soils formed in alluvium from pyroclastics over chert, dolomitic limestone and calcareous sandstone.  The annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 14 inches occuring as summer thunderstorms and winter rain or snow.  The mean annual temperature range is from 50 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 130 to 170 days."
