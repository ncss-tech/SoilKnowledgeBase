  "BYREV": "Rev. LWB-WEF",
  "REVDATE": "08/2012",
  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Detour series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are moderately deep to dense till. Detour soils formed in loamy till on ground moraines and glacial lake benches. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",
