The soils formed in volcanic ash and cinders with an admixture of loess from mixed igneous rock sources.  Elevations are 4,150 to 4,500 feet.  The climate is characterized by cold, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period is 50 to 80 days."

Lawen soils are on adjacent high lake terraces, have a mollic epipedon, and lack a duripan.  Middlebox soils are on adjacent higher hills, and lack a duripan.  Outerkirk soils are on adjacent lower alluvial fans and fan terraces, are mesic, and lack a duripan.  Reallis soils are on adjacent lake terraces and lack a duripan.  Wolverine soils are on sand dunes, and have sand and loamy sand textures throughout."
