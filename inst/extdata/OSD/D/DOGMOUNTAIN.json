  "OVERVIEW": "The Dogmountain series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and cinders from mixed igneous rock sources with an admixture of loess .  Dogmountain soils are on hills.  Slopes are 4 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
