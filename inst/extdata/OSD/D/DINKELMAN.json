    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F. Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches to a paralithic contact. [r1]The particle-size control section averages 15 to 35 percent rock fragments and 25 to 35 percent coarse and very coarse sand. The upper 7 to 15 inches of the mollic epipedon has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.20 to 1.40 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts for 60 to 75 consecutive days. The soils are slightly acid to slightly alkaline throughout. Base saturation is less than 75 percent in some part about the 30 inches depth.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3 dry or moist. This horizon is massive or has weak structure.\nThe Bw horizon has value of  5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry. It is fine sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, gravelly coarse sandy loam, or gravelly loam. This horizon has weak structure or is massive. Some pedons have a C horizon."

Republic soils average 15 to 25 percent coarse plus very coarse sand in the particle-size control section, and 5 to 35 percent rounded rock fragments of till origin, and are very deep. Bunchpoint soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact. Kilmerque soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact. Thrapp soils are 36 to 45 inches to a densic contact. Lani soils are very deep."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dinkelman soils are on mountain side slopes at elevations of 1,800 to 3,700 feet. Most have north or east aspect. The slopes range from 0 to 90 percent. These soils formed in material weathered from granitic rock with volcanic ash influence. Some pedons contain some rounded glacial gravel. These soils are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 24 inches. The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."

Bisping, McCree, Nevine, and Palmich soils have more than 60 percent pyroclastic materials. Centralpeak and Spokane soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Dragoon and Morical soils have an argillic horizon and are 20 to 40 inches deep. Switchback soils lack a mollic epipedon. Tyee soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 10 to 20 inches."
