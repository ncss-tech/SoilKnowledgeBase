  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dandrea soils are at elevations of 6,000 to 8,000 feet in a subhumid continental climate.  These soils formed in place on weathered schist or closely related materials.  Dandrea soils are on rolling to very steep schist hills or mountains with slopes ranging from 15 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 25 inches and occurs mainly as thunderstorms in July and August and gentle rains or snow during the winter and spring.  The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 130 days."

Barkerville soils are dark-colored, lack and argillic horizon and are in a loamy, mesic family.  Brolliar soils have mollic epipedons and formed on basalt.  Gaddes soils are moderately fine-textured and have mean annual temperature warmer than 47 degrees F."
