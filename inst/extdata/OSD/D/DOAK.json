These soils formed in eolian and fan alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 4,700 to 6,800 feet. Mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches. The mean air annual air temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. In Arizona precipitation is as much as 11 inches and air temperature as high as 57 degrees F."
