  "OVERVIEW": "The Doak series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in eolian and fan alluvium from sandstone and shale.   Doak soils are on cuesta dipslopes, mesas, plateaus, and fan remnants on valley sides. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
