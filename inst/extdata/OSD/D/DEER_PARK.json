  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the horizons of sesquoxide and organic matter accumulation (Bs horizons) is 18 to 55 inches (measured from the upper boundary of the mineral horizons).  Mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3,  chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  Texture is sand or fine sand. Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is sand or fine sand.  Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid.  In some pedons, few dark colored organic stains are in the upper part of the E horizon and many flecks of dark colored grains from the overlying A horizon are mixed throughout the horizon.\nThe Bs horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6, and the color value of the upper part of the horizon is 1 unit darker than that of the E horizon.  Texture is sand or fine sand. Acid-oxalate extractable Al plus 1/2 Fe is .25 to .50 percent.  Reaction is extremely acid to slightly acid.  Some pedons have 25 to 50 percent orstein.\nSome pedons have BC horizons with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 or 5.  Some pedons have 25 to 50 percent orstein.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is sand or fine sand.  Reaction is extremely acid to slightly acid."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Eastport soils are on nearly level to steep sand plains, ridges, and dunes adjacent to the Great Lakes.  The dunes and ridges range from gently sloping to as much as 50 feet above the nearby lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in sandy lacustrine sediments, in some places reworked by wind.  Elevations are 580 to 700 feet.  Mean annual temperature is estimated to range from 40 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 27 to 33 inches.  The frost free period is 120 to 150 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  The moderately well drained Croswell soil, the somewhat poorly drained Au Gres and Finch soils, and the poorly or very poorly drained Roscommon soils are on level or nearly level nearby lake plains.  In many places, the somewhat excessively drained Kalkaska soils and excessively drained Rubicon soils are on older sand dunes farther from the lakes. Kalkaska and Rubicon soils have well expressed spodic horizons."
