  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is moist in some parts between depths of 5 to 15 inches from mid-November until the middle of June and moist in all parts from December through April.  Usually it is dry all the rest of the year.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 44 to 47 degrees F.. Soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches exceeds 41 degrees F. from April 1 to November 1 and 47 degrees F. from April 15 to November 1.  The solum is 40 to 70 inches thick.  The soil is slightly or medium acid and nearly constant in reaction with increasing soil depth.  The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.  Value is 3 or 4 in a thin A1 horizon and is 6 within several inches depth in the A3 horizon.  Moist value is 3 in the A1 horizon and 4 in the A3 horizon.  Chroma if 3 or 4 dry and moist.  The A horizon is sandy loam or loam and in some pedons is modified with up to 35 percent cobblestones.  The B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam."

The climate is cool semiarid to subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 to 24 inches.  The average January temperature is about 28 degrees F., average July temperature is about 62 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is about 45 to 47 degrees F.  The average freeze-free season is about 50 to 60 days."
