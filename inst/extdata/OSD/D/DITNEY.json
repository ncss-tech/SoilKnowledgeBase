    "content": "REMARKS: The 5/00 revision reflects the movement of the official type location from Monroe County, Tennessee to Sullivan County, Tennessee. Competing series section was also updated. The 2/99 revision updated classification to 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy and placed this soil in the semiactive CEC activity class based on NSSL Sample S77TN-171-003 and similar soils. In past mapping in Tennessee, these soils have been included in the Ramsey and Ranger series. 10/13 revision verifies classification --11th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Note-mineral surface layers typically 3-5 inches thick.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 20 cm, 0 to 8 inches. (Oi, A, and BA horizons)\nb. Cambic horizon --the zone from 20 to 64 cm, 8 to 25 inches.  (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons.)\nc. Paralithic contact--weathered bedrock contact at 64 cm, 25 inches (upper boundary of the Cr horizon)\nd. Lithic contact--unweathered, hard bedrock at 71 cm, 28 inches."
