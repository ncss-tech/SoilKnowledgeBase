  "OVERVIEW": "The Durkee series consists of moderately deep, well drained\nsoils on Hills.  They formed in colluvium from argillite or\nrhyolite with and influence of volcanic ash and loess in the\nupper part.  Slope ranges from 1 to 60 percent.  The mean\nannual temperature is about 43 degrees F, and the mean\nannual precipitation is about 14 inches.",
