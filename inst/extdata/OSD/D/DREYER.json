    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches . The soil is clay or silty clay throughout. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and is calcareous throughout . Clay content the particle size control section ranges from 40 to 60 percent . Cracks which extend to more than 20 inches are up to 2 inches wide on the surface remain open 90 to 150 cumulative days in most years. Untilled areas have linear gilgai microrelief with microlows 1 to 3 feet wide and 2 to 8 inches deep, and microhighs 10 to 16 feet wide that extend up and down slopes. Depth to slickensides ranges from 8 to 18 inches, and are present throughout the pedon. Boundary between horizons is wavy or irregular. Chroma is 2 or more within 12 inches in more than half of the pedons. Where the A horizon is 12 inches thick or less the value moist is 4 or more, 6 or more dry, or the chroma is 3 or more. Calcium carbonate equivalent  ranges from 15 to 40 percent within 40 inches of the surface. Ironstone pebbles range from 2 to 6 percent throughout .\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. Masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown or yellow and iron depletions in shades of gray range from none to few. Calcium carbonate concretions range from 0 to 2 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 . Calcium carbonate in the form of concretions and threads range from 0 to 2 percent.\nThe Bkss horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of  2 to 4 . Masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown or yellow and iron depletions in shades of gray range from none to few .  Calcium carbonate in the form of concretions, masses, and threads range from 5 to 25 percent. Crysrtals of gypsum range from  0 to 2 percent .\nThe BCky or BCkss horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 2 to 4. Masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown or yellow range from none to few. The clay texture is interbedded with gray fragments of shale . Calcium carbonate in the form of concretions and masses range from 2 to 25 percent. Crystals of gypsum range from  2 to 4 percent .\nThe Cy or C horizon has colors similar to the BCk horizon in both its matrix and mottles. It has shale which is interbedded with clay.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Deport (TX), Frelsberg (TX), amd Latium (TX) series. Chapel soils have mean annual soil temperature between 60 and 65 degrees, and have solum thickness more than 80 inches.  Frelsberg soils have chroma of less than 2 to depths greater than 20 inches. Latium  soils do not have occurrence of  small amounts of gypsum in the lower solum, and formed in Tertiary age member of the Fleming Formation."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dreyer soils are on gently sloping to strongly sloping uplands. The geomorphic surface is plane to convex with slopes ranging from 3 to 12 percent. Surface microhighs and microlows have been removed by cultivation in cropped areas. These soils formed from weakly cemented calcareous clays and marls of Tertiary age, mainly of the Cook Mountain Formation. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 38 inches and mean annual air temperatures ranges from 67 to 70 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 260 to 280, and elevation ranges from 200 to 500 feet . Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 44 to about 56 ."
