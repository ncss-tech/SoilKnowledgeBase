  "OVERVIEW": "The Desker series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that are moderately deep to calcareous, stratified sandy and gravelly outwash. The Desker soils formed in gravelly loamy and gravelly sandy outwash. They are on kames, eskers, terraces, and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
