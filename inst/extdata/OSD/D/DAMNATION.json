They formed in volcanic ash mixed with glacial drift and colluvium over gneiss, granite, or granodiorite bedrock. The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1300 to 2500 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 9 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 60 to 90 days."
