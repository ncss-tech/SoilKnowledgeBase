  "OVERVIEW": "The Dobbs series consists of moderately deep to densic material, moderately well drained soils formed in glacial till derived from andesite with a mantle of andesitic colluvium, volcanic ash and pumiceous cinders.  Dobbs soils are in cirque basins and on adjacent mountain slopes.  Elevation ranges from 2,000 to 3,200 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 90 percent.   Average annual precipitation is about 85 inches and average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
