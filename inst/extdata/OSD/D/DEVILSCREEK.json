    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Devilscreek soils are on mountain slopes near drainage headwaters. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. Elevations are 15 to 757 meters (45 to 2480 feet). These soils formed in colluvium weathered from schist. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1780 to 2550 millimeters (70 to 100 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is about 240 to 300 days."
