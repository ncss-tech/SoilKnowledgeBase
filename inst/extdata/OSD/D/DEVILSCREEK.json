  "OVERVIEW": "The Devilscreek series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in colluvium from schist. Devilscreek soils are on mountains and have slopes of 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2160 millimeters (85 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
