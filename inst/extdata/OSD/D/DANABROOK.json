An intermittent perched high water table is at a depth of 61 to 107 cm (2.0 to 3.5 feet) below the surface at some time between February and April in most years. The potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the solum and moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow in the underlying material."
