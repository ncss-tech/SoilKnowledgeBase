  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Demner series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium and colluvium derived from basic and intermediate igneous rocks. Demner soils occur on alluvial fans and mountain slopes. Slopes are 2 to 70 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 5.5 degrees C.",
