Bullvaro soils have mollic epipedons more than 76 cm thick, are strongly influenced by loess in the upper part of the profile, and have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Burchflat and Vipont soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Demner soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon of 50 to 76 cm from the soil surface and have C horizons dominated by cobbles.  Erig soils have a xeric moisture regime and are deep to lithic contacts.  Leroman and Staberg soils have a xeric moisture regime and are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Lockgate soils have a xeric moisture regime and are deep to paralithic contacts.  Nutval soils have 18 to 25 percent clay and more than 40 percent medium sand through very coarse sand in the particle-size control section.  Vetagrande soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dooh soils are on fan remnants on mountain valleys.  They typically occur on footslope and backslope positions.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a strong influence from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,045 to 2,445 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 380 mm, the mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 65 to 75 days."
