  "OVERVIEW": "The Dooh series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a strong influence from granitic rocks.  Dooh soils are on fan remnants on mountain valleys.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

Bullvaro soils have mollic epipedons more than 76 cm thick, are strongly influenced by loess in the upper part of the profile, and have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Burchflat and Vipont soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Demner soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon of 50 to 76 cm from the soil surface and have C horizons dominated by cobbles.  Erig soils have a xeric moisture regime and are deep to lithic contacts.  Leroman and Staberg soils have a xeric moisture regime and are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Lockgate soils have a xeric moisture regime and are deep to paralithic contacts.
