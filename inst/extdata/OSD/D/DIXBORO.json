  "OVERVIEW": "The Dixboro series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in stratified glaciofluvial deposits. These soils are on lake plains, outwash plains, and deltas. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).",
