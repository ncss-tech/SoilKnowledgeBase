  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick.  The combined thickness of the A1 and B2t horizons ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  The lower part of the B horizon may be slightly to moderately calcareous.  Gravel and cobble content generally increase with depth, ranging 10 to 30 percent in the A horizon, 20 to 35 percent in the B horizon, and 35 to 80 percent in the C horizon.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 39 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 60 to 65 degrees F.  The soils are moist 55 to 65 percent of the time but are dry in all parts of the 4 to 12 inch zone for 60 to 75 consecutive days in the summer and early autumn.  The A1 horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has weak to moderate, very fine to fine granular structure in the upper part and weak medium to coarse subangular blocky structure in the lower part.  This horizon horizon ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  It is 10 to 18 inches thick.  The B2t horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is cobbly and gravelly light clay loam or cobbly and gravelly heavy loam, with more than 18 percent clay and 20 to 35 percent cobbles and gravel.  This horizon has weak to moderate fine films on peds and in pores.  The B2t horizon is slightly acid to mildly alkaline and is 8 to 20 inches thick.  The C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It ranges from cobbly and gravelly loam to very cobbly and gravelly clay loam.  This horizon has weak subangular blocky structure or is massive.  It is mildly to moderately alkaline and moderately to strongly calcareous."

Ant Flat soils have clay argillic horizons and have less than 15 percent rock fragments.  Clegg soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon.  Datwyler soils have very cobbly clay argillic horizons.  Gross soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Horrocks, Sheep Creek and Smarts soils have more than 35 percent cobbles and gravel in the argillic horizon. Lize, Horrocks and Smarts soils lack horizons of carbonate accumulation."

In the Clarkston Mountain area, these soils are on north facing slopes.  The soils formed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone, limestone and quartzite.  The climate is humid, with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual temperature is 37 to 44 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 16 to 28 inches.  The frost free season is 60 to 100 days."
