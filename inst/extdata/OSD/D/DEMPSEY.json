  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 25 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 36 to 60 inches, and there should be no bedrock or strongly contrasting substratums above 40 inches or immediately below the solum if thicker than 40 inches.  These soils are noncalcareous throughout and they do not have horizons of visible secondary carbonate accumulation.  The content of carbon normally ranges from .8 to 3 percent in the mollic epipedon and decreases uniformly with depth.  Usually conductivity is less than 1 millimho and exchangeable sodium percentage is less than 1.  The soil is 80 to 100 percent base saturated.  Content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent but is typically less than 5 percent.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 degrees F. to 47 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 degrees F. to 70 degrees F.\nColors of the A horizon may range in hue from 5Y to 7.5YR, in value from 4 to 5 dry or 2 to 3 moist, and in chroma from 2 to 3.  Reaction normally ranges from pH 6.6 to pH 7.8 (1:5 dilution organic dye).  Primary structure is usually granular in the upper part and subangular blocky in the lower part of the horizon.  Consistence ranges from soft to slightly hard.\nColor of the B2t horizon may range in hue from 5Y to 7.5YR, in value from 5 to 6 dry or 3 to 5 moist, and in chroma from 2 to 4.  Reaction normally ranges from pH 6.6 to pH 7.8 (1:5 dilution organic dye).  Primary structure is usually very coarse prismatic but may be subangular blocky.  Texture is typically a fine sandy loam, but clay may range from 8 to 18 percent, silt from 5 to 35 percent and sand from 50 to 82 percent with more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.  Oriented clay films occur in some part of this horizon.\nHue of the C horizon may range from 5Y to 7.5YR.  Reaction normally ranges from pH6.6 to pH 7.8 (1:5 dilution organic dye).  Texture is typically a light sandy loam, but the horizon should have less than 18 percent clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series presently in this subgroup and family.  Similar and related series include the Elzinga and Osha series.   The Elzinga series differs in being finer textured, in lacking continuous argillic horizons, and in having more than 35 percent coarse fragments.  The Osha series differs in having more than 35 percent coarse fragments, in lacking mollic epipedons more than 24 inches thick, and in having developed in materials weathered from granite containing a high proportion of medium and coarse granite sand.\nThe Dempsey series occurs on gently to moderately sloping alluvial fans generally in areas where snow accumulates in the winter months.  Slopes typically range from 2 percent to about 15 or more percent.  The soil is developing in thick, noncalcareous, alluvial fan materials derived from sandstone and loamstone.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 10 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual air temperature is 40 degrees F., mean summer air temperature is 60 degrees F., mean annual soil temperature is 45 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is 61 degrees F."
