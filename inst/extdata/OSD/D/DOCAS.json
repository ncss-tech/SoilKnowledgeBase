  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is about 60 degrees to 63 degrees F., and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F. at any time. The soil between depths of about 5 and 15 inches is usually dry all of the time from April or May until November or early December and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year. The soil is weakly to violently effervescent in all parts after plowing. The amount of lime increases somewhat from the surface downward. Most pedons have some fine lime segregations in the lower part. The 10 to 40 inch control section is silt loam or silty clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent very fine sand or coarser. The soil has some fine stratification.\nThe A horizon is gray to light olive gray (lOYR 6/1, 7/1, 6/2; 2.5Y 6/2; 5Y 6/1, 7/1, 7/2, 6/2). Organic matter ranges from less than 1 percent to 3 percent and decreases irregularly with depth.\nThe C horizon has about the same colors as the A horizon but its value usually is one-half to one unit higher or the chroma is one-half to one unit stronger than that of the A horizon."

Garretson soils have more than 15 percent sand and gravel and are noncalcareous. Maywood, Ramada, and Reiff soils have less than 18 percent clay and are noncalcareous in the upper part of the profile. Panoche soils have an aridic moisture regime.  Shedd soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Salado and Wunjey soils have less than 18 percent clay."

They formed in silty alluvium from shale formations. The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches . Average July temperature is about 75 degrees F.; average January temperature is about 48 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 58 degrees to 62 degrees F. The freeze-free season is 200 to 300 days."

Linne and Salinas soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments and sand coarser than very fine sand. Rincon soils have an argillic horizon."
