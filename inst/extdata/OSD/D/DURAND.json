  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nThickness of the solum: 122 to 229 cm (48 to 90 inches), thickness depends upon the degree of truncation of the paleosol before deposition of loess. Where sola are more than 152 cm (5 feet) thick, the content of the clay decreases more than 20 percent and the chroma is 4 or less within 152 cm (60 inches).\nAverage content of clay in the particle-size control section: between 27 to 35 percent\nAverage content fine sand or coarser in the particle-size control section: between 15 to 35 percent\nDepth to carbonates: greater than 122 cm (48 inches)\nA or Ap horizon:\nHue: 10YR\nValue: 2 or 3\nChroma: 1 or 2\nTexture: silt loam except severely eroded pedons are commonly silty clay loam\nReaction: slightly acid to strongly acid where not limed\nAB horizon:\nHue: 10YR\nValue: 3\nChroma: 2 or 3\nTexture: silt loam\nOther features:\nSome pedons have a BA horizon rather than an AB horizon. In other pedons the Ap horizon directly overlies the top of the argillic horizon.\nBt horizon:\nHue: 10YR or 7.5YR\nValue: 4 or 5\nChroma: 3 to 6\nTexture: silt loam or silty clay loam\nAverage sand content: less than 10 percent\nStructure: subangular blocky structure\nReaction: from slightly acid to strongly acid\n2Bt horizon:\nHue: 7.5YR to 2.5YR, at least one subhorizon has hue redder than 7.5YR on the faces of peds or in the matrix\nValue: 4 or 5\nChroma: 4 to 6\nTexture: commonly clay loam, but includes sandy clay loam, loam, or sandy loam and the gravelly analogues of these textures.\nStructure: commonly subangular or angular blocky,  but is prismatic in the lower part of some pedons\nRock fragment content: 0 to 30 percent\nReaction: moderately acid or strongly acid in the most acidic part, and commonly grades to slightly acid in the lower part.\n2C horizon:\nHue: 10YR or 7.5YR\nValue: 5 or 6\nChroma: 4 to 6\nTexture: gravelly sandy loam, sandy loam or loam\nReaction: slightly acid to moderately alkaline"

All of these soils except Atkinson, Hitt, Joslin, Marbletown, Morrill, Rockton, Sibleyville, and Winnebago Atkinson soils average more than 40 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Burchard, Cokato, Cresco, Cresent, Friesland, Griswold, Jasper, Keosauqua, Kishwaukee, Moigona, Nuxmaruhanixete Parmod, Penfield, Reedslake, Ringwood, Schoolcraft, Shelby and Velma soils do not have hue as red as 5YR in the argillic horizon. Hitt, Marbletown, Rockton, and Sibleyville soils have a lithic or paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Joslin soils average less than 27 percent clay in the particle size control section. Morrill, and Winnebago soils average more than 10 percent sand in the upper part of the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Durand soils are on undulating to hilly till plains and moraines. Slope gradients range from 1 to 20 percent. The upper part of the solum formed in 38 to 76 cm (15 to 30 inches) of loess or silty material and the lower part in reddish paleosols in loamy till. In some places the solum is underlain by calcareous till and in other places it rests directly on limestone bedrock at depths of 152 cm (5 feet) or greater. The mean annual temperature is 7.2  to 10 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees F), mean annual precipitation is 838 to 965 mm (33 and 38 inches), and frost free period is 140 to 160 days."

The Argyle and Pecatonica soils are on similar landforms as Durand soils near drainageways. Pecatonica soils do not have mollic epipedons. Griswold, Ogle, and Tama soils are on nearby landscapes. Tama soils generally are upslope and formed entirely in loess."
