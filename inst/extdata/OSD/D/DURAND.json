  "OVERVIEW": "The Durand series consists of very deep, well drained soils on undulating to hilly till plains and moraines. These soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and the underlying loamy till with reddish paleosol horizons. Slope ranges from 1 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).",

The upper part of the solum formed in 38 to 76 cm (15 to 30 inches) of loess or silty material and the lower part in reddish paleosols in loamy till. In some places the solum is underlain by calcareous till and in other places it rests directly on limestone bedrock at depths of 152 cm (5 feet) or greater. The mean annual temperature is 7.2  to 10 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees F), mean annual precipitation is 838 to 965 mm (33 and 38 inches), and frost free period is 140 to 160 days."
