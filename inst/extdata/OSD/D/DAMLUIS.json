    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is more than 60 inches deep.  The soil between the depths of 6 and 17 inches is moist throughout from about January 1 to May 1 and dry throughout from about July 1 to November 1.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.  The soil temperature is below 47 degrees F in parts of January and February and is never below 41 degrees F at any time.  Calcium carbonate equivalent in the solum ranges from 3 to 25 percent but is never 5 percent or more than the underlying horizon.  Some pedons do not have a very gravelly layer in the lower C horizon.\nThe A horizon ranges from 35 to 40 percent clay content.  The Btk horizon ranges from 45 to 55 percent clay content and has at least 1.2 times more clay than the A horizon.  Gravel ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the solum and upper C horizon and from 35 to 60 percent in the lower C horizon.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, or 5/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2, 3/3; or 7.5YR 3/2.  Colors of 7.5YR 4/4 occur only as a minor part of the A horizon.  Texture is clay loam or gravelly clay loam.  The A horizon is noncalcareous to slightly effervescent.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 4/2, 4/3; 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6, 6/6; 5YR 5/3, 5/4, or 5/6.

Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Ck horizon is 10YR 6/8, 7/2, 7/6; 7.5YR 5/6, 6/4, 6/6, 6/8, 7/6, or 7/8.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/4, 5/8, 6/4, 6/6; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/6, 5/8, 6/6, or 6/8.  The clay content ranges from 28 to 40 percent.  Texture is commonly clay loam or gravelly clay loam and less commonly sandy clay loam, sandy clay, gravelly sandy clay loam and gravelly sandy clay.\nThe 3Ck horizon is 10YR 6/6, 7/6, 8/4, 8/6; 7.5YR 5/6, 6/6, 6/8, or 7/6.   Moist colors are 10YR 4/6, 5/6, 6/6, 7/4, 7/6; 7.5YR 4/6, 5/6, 5/8, or 6/6.  Texture is very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly sandy clay loam.  The clay content ranges from 15 to 25 percent."
