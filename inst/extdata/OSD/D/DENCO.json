    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 37 inches.  (Bssy1, Bssy2, and Cby horizons)\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 4 inches.  (A horizon)\nVertic features:  Cracks 1 centimeter or more wide extending from the surface to 20 inches, and the presence of slickensides at a depth of 4 to 29 inches in depth (Bssy horizons).  Lab sample 82T7254 results confirmed vertic potential.\nParalithic contact:  The contact with weathered shale at 37 inches.  (Cr horizon)\nThese soils are located in an area that range up to 12 inches of precipitation (typically an ustic aridic zone), but the interaction of soil conditions (i.e. high clay content) and moisture only allow desert community plants to predominate.\nThe cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.\nThe classification was changed from mixed Vertic Torriorthents to smectitic Leptic Haplotorrerts 1/99.\nTaxonomic Version:  Eighth Edition, 1998.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
