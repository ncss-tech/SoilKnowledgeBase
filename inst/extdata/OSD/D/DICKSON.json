    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 18 to 36 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid except where lime has been added.  Fragments of gravel range from none to 10 percent in the lower Btx horizon and up to 35 percent in the 2Bt horizon.  Depth to hard bedrock is greater than 5 feet.Some pedons have a paralithic contact below 60 inches.  Transition horizons have color and textures similar to adjacent horizons.\nThe Ap and A horizon have hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe E horizon, or E'horizon if present, has hue of 10YR , value of 4 to 6, chroma of 2 to 4, or hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon or Bt horizon, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Redox features in shades of brown, yellow, and gray range from none to common in the lower part of the horizon.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6 with redox features in shades of brown, yellow, red, and gray.  Some pedons do not have a dominant matrix color but are in a composite of shades of brown, yellow, red, or gray.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons have hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Relic mottles and redox features are in shades of brown, yellow, red, and gray.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or gravelly phases of these textures."
