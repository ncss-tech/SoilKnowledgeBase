  "OVERVIEW": "Denihler series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and glacial till derived from metamorphic rocks. Denihler soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
