  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F. and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F.  at any time.  The soil between depths of 4 and 12 inches is usually dry all of the time from late April or May until November or early December and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.  Rock fragments range up to 15 percent.\nThe A horizon is dark gray, black, dark grayish brown, very dark grayish brown, or very dark brown.  It is clay loam, sandy clay loam, gravelly clay loam, or silty clay loam.  This horizon has weak to strong granular or subangular blocky structure.  It is moderately acid to moderately alkaline and has 75 to 100 percent base saturation.  Soil amendments and fertilizers have altered reaction in some pedons.  Organic matter content ranges from 2 to 3 percent in upper parts and decreases regularly with about 1 percent at about 30 inches.\nThe Bt horizon is very dark grayish brown, dark grayish brown to dark brown (10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3; 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 5/4).  It is clay, sandy clay, or gravelly sandy clay loam.  The upper boundary is gradual or clear.   This horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline.  It has weak or strong prismatic or angular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon, when present, is brown, dark brown, strong brown, dark grayish brown and dark yellowish brown and the hue is 7.5YR or 10YR.  It is sandy loam, gravelly sandy clay loam, loamy sand or clay loam and is somewhat stratified.  This horizon is generally slightly or moderately alkaline.  In some pedons the lower part of the profile is calcareous."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Danville soils are on fans and terraces, at elevations of 100 to 1,500 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium with some coarse sand derived from sedimentary and crystalline rocks.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 25 inches.  The average July temperature is 67 degrees F.; the average January temperature is 48 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 58 to 63 degrees F.  The frost free season is 250 to 330 days. Phases exist along the coast of California that have average January temperatures of about 56 degrees F. and frost free seasons of 320 to 350 days."

McCoy soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Placentia soils have natric horizons.  Rincon soils have hard and massive epipedons.  Yolo soils lack a mollic epipedon and an argillic horizon."
