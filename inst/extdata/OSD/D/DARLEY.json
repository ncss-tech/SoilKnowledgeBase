    "content": "TYPE LOCATION:  Claiborne Parish, Louisiana; 4 miles SE of Libson; 790 feet north and 520 feet west of the SE corner, sec. 32, T. 32 N., R. 4 W.\nRANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS;  Solum thickness exceeds 60 inches.  Depth to ironstone layers typically ranges from 20 to 40 inches and can range from 10 to 40 inches.  Angular and flattened fragments of ironstone make up from 15 to 35 percent of the volume in the A and E horizons.  The number of fractured, nearly continuous ironstone layers typically ranges from 1 to 4 within the solum.  Thickness of ironstone layers ranges from 1/2-inch to 12 inches.  The average lateral distance between fractures in the ironstone ranges from 2 to 20 inches and averages 4 to 8 inches.  The average content of clay in the textural control section averages from 40 to 60 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.  Texture is gravelly loamy fine sand, gravelly loamy sand, gravelly fine sandy loam, or gravelly sandy loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is gravelly loamy fine sand, gravelly loamy sand, gravelly fine sandy loam, or gravelly sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon, above the ironstone layers, has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, clay, or their gravelly counterparts.  Content of clay ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  Fragments of ironstone make up from less than 1 percent to 20 percent of the volume.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bt/Bsm horizon consists of alternating layers of ironstone and sandy clay or clay.  Ironstone fragments, including fragments that make up the ironstone layers, make up from 20 to 60 percent of the volume of the horizon.  The ironstone layers are fractured and range in thickness from 1/2-inch to 12 inches.  The lateral distance between fractures ranges from 2 to 20 inches and averages 4 to 8 inches.  Typically, the ironstone layers are continuous for several feet; but in some pedons they are intermittent and extend only a few feet horizontally.  In some pedons, the layers are parts of the large spheroidal configurations that are separated from one another by vertical flows of red clay, sandy clay or clay loam.  The less than 2 millimeter fraction has hue of 5YR, 2.5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Few to many small pockets and strata of whitish or grayish kaolin are in most pedons.  Pockets and strata of loamy or sandy material range from none to common. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.  The BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam. Peds that are firm and brittle range from none to commmon make up as much as 20 percent of the matrix.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid."

Similar competing series include Alto, Bub, Cuthbert, Kirvin, Meth, Nacogdoches, Redsprings, Sacul, Sweatman, and Trawick soils.  The Appling, Aragon, Cataula, Cecil, Chestatee, Georgeville, Herndon, Hulett, Nankin, Nectar, Pacolet, Spotsylvania, and Wedowee soils formed in acid residium on the Piedmont uplands or Appalachian Plateau and are underlain by weathered bedrock.  The Alto, Bub, Meth, Nacogdoches, Redsprings, and Trawick soils have more than 35 percent base saturation within 125 centimeters below the top of the argillic horizon.  The Cuthbert, Kirvin, Sacul, and Sweatman soils have mixed minerology.  The Kolomoki soils do not contain fragments or layers of ironstone."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Darley soils are convex ridgetops and upper side slopes in the uplands of the Western Coastal Plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in iron-rich, clayey, marine sediments.  The typical pedon is forming in sediments of the Cockfield or Cook Mountain Formation, Claiborne Group, Eocene Series.  The mean annual temperature is 64 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 51 inches."
