  "ADDITIONAL DATA": {
    "section": "ADDITIONAL DATA",
    "content": "ADDITIONAL DATA:  These soils are assumed to have originally classified as fine-silty, mixed, mesic Typic Argiudolls and were mapped as Geary series, eroded.  However, because of severe erosion, these soils no longer have the thick dark surface soil necessary for this classification.  In addition, the part of the soil containing the most clay is now at or near the surface.  These changes have a significant affect on the use and management of these soils. These soils are now classified as Mollic Hapludalfs."
