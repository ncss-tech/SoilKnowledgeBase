    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 7 to 40 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nOchric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 7 inches.  (Ap horizons)\nArgillic horizon: The zone from 7 to 40 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA:  These soils are assumed to have originally classified as fine-silty, mixed, mesic Typic Argiudolls and were mapped as Geary series, eroded.  However, because of severe erosion, these soils no longer have the thick dark surface soil necessary for this classification.  In addition, the part of the soil containing the most clay is now at or near the surface.  These changes have a significant affect on the use and management of these soils. These soils are now classified as Mollic Hapludalfs.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
