    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 80 inches.  The control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay.  Pressure faces and small slickensides ranges from none to a few in the Bt horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Horizons with value of 3 are less than 7 inches thick.  Grayish or brownish redoximorphic features range from none to common.  Yellowish, brownish, or reddish coatings are along root channels and pores during wet periods.  It is very fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  The reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid unless limed.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Grayish, brownish or yellowish redoximorphic features range from few to common in most pedons.  Yellowish, brownish, or reddish coatings are along root channels and pores during wet periods.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  The reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Btg/E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Brownish, yellowish, or reddish redoximorphic features and/or coatings along root channels range from few to common in most pedons.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay. Albic material (E) in the form of streaks, pockets, and coatings make up 5 to 35 percent of this horizon.  In some part of the pedon this horizon has 15 percent or more albic materials.  The reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features or coatings  along root channels in shades of gray, brown, red, or yellow range from few to common in some part of this horizon.  Some pedons have a mottled matrix in some part.  Texture is clay or clay loam in the upper part and clay, silty clay loam, clay loam, or loam in the lower part.  The reaction of the upper part ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.  The lower part ranges from strongly acid to neutral.  Gypsum crystals or masses range from none to common.  Some pedons contain a few calcium carbonate concretions in the lower part.  Typically, they are hard and pitted.  Some pedons have BCt horizons with high value colors and loamy textures."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aris, Encrow, and Mowata series in the same family and the Alusa, Crowley, Evadale, Lufkin, Panola, Mollville, and Wrightsville.  Aris soils are moist in the moisture control section for longer periods and have annual temperatures of 68 to 70 degrees F.  The Mowata soils have sola less than 60 inches thick.  Encrow soils have a lithologic discontinuity in the argillic horizon and an ESP of 5-15 percent in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Alusa, Crowley, Lufkin, and Panola soils do not have a glossic horizon.  Evadale and Wrightsville soils have mixed mineralogy.  Mollville soils have a fine-loamy control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Derly soils are on nearly level to concave areas, typically between mounds.  These soils formed in loamy and clayey sediments on Pleistocene Age Terraces about 30 to 80 feet above present flood plains.  They are commonly on second or third terrace levels of rivers or on slightly higher terrace smears associated with uplands.  The average annual temperature ranges from 63 to about 68 degrees F.; the average annual rainfall ranges from 36 to 46 inches.  Frost free days ranges from 230 to 275, and the elevation ranges from 150 to 400 feet above sea level.  Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 60 to 68."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Associated soils are those of the Annona, Freestone, Hicota, Rader, Raino, and Woodtell series.  Annona and Woodtell soils have redder hues and do not have albic materials in the argillic horizon and are on uplands.  Freestone, Hicota, Rader and Raino soils are on mounds or other slightly higher positions and have fine-loamy control sections."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Derly soils are poorly drained   and have very slow permeability.  They have negligible runoff.  Water is ponded on the surface for brief to long periods during the winter and spring seasons of most years.  A perched water table is in the Eg and the Btg/E horizons for more than 30 consecutive days from October to May during most years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Derly soils are used mainly for pasture and woodland.  Native vegetation is an overstory of elm, post oak, willow oak, and water oak.  Grasses include such species as beaked panicum, longleaf uniola, and sedges.  Bermudagrass, dallisgrass, and fescuegrass are the dominant pasture plants."

They were formerly included with the Wrightsville or Lufkin series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - A and E horizons from 0 to 8 inches.\nArgillic horizons - the Bt horizons from 8 to 84 inches.\nAquic feature - low chromas and mottles caused by wetness in the 3 to 84 inch layers.\nGlossic feature - has 15 percent or more albic material in the upper part of the argillic horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Data from Lincoln Laboratory, March 1966, LSL 20866 (Btg/E horizon) and samples from two pedons in Smith County indicate the clay is dominantly montmorillonite with small amounts of kaolinite and quartz.\nMadison County characterization data by TAMU S-85TX-313-001.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
