  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates ranges from 16 to 35 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to gypsum and other salts typically is 16 to 25 inches and ranges from 16 to 40 inches.  Depth to salts or gypsum are above free carbonates in most pedons.  The natric horizon typically has exchangeable magnesium plus sodium that is greater than calcium plus exchangeable acidity and the SAR and ESP ranges from 10 to 20.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or loam and is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  In most cultivated areas, it is mixed with the A horizon.  The E horizon is silt loam or loam and is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay and averages between 35 and 50 percent clay and has more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the upper part and neutral to moderately alkaline in the lower part.  Btnz or Btnkz horizons are in some pedons.\nThe Bz and Bkz horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  They have few to many fine to coarse mottles in some pedons.  They are clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay and are slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  It contains 1 to 10 percent coarse fragments.  Bk horizons are in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam and is slightly to strongly alkaline.  It contains 1 to 10 percent coarse fragments. Mottling is mostly inherent to the parent material."

Cavo, DeGrey, Mosher and Wood River soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Dudley soils formed in calcareous glacial till on upland till plains and in upland foot slopes.  Surfaces typically are plane to slightly concave.  Slope gradients typically are 0 to 3 percent but range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 26 inches.  Growing season is about 130 to 160 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 13 to 20 inches; and growing degree days are about 2800 to 3500."

Beadle, Clarno, Crossplain, Davison, Houdek, Prosper, and Tetonka soils do not have a natric horizon.  Beadle, Clarno, and Houdek soils are on higher upland landscapes.  Crossplain and Prosper soils are on toe slopes and foot slopes, respectively.  Davison soils are in slightly higher positions.  Hoven soils are saturated for 30 to 60 days or more to a depth of 3 feet or more in most years.  The poorly drained Hoven and Tetonka soils are in closed depressions.  Jerauld soils have a thinner mollic epipedon, salts within 16 inches, and are in similar landscapes positions. Stickney soils do not have columnar structured Btn horizons and are in similar landscapes."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well or somewhat poorly drained. Runoff is low or very high depending on slope.  Permeability is slow or very slow.  Somewhat poorly drained soils are in swales and receive common flooding from run-in water from adjacent slopes. A water table may be within 2 feet of the surface for short periods in the spring of the year."
