Depth to gypsum and other salts typically is 16 to 25 inches and ranges from 16 to 40 inches.  Depth to salts or gypsum are above free carbonates in most pedons.  The natric horizon typically has exchangeable magnesium plus sodium that is greater than calcium plus exchangeable acidity and the SAR and ESP ranges from 10 to 20.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or loam and is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  In most cultivated areas, it is mixed with the A horizon.  The E horizon is silt loam or loam and is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay and averages between 35 and 50 percent clay and has more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the upper part and neutral to moderately alkaline in the lower part.  Btnz or Btnkz horizons are in some pedons.\nThe Bz and Bkz horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.

Crossplain and Prosper soils are on toe slopes and foot slopes, respectively.  Davison soils are in slightly higher positions.  Hoven soils are saturated for 30 to 60 days or more to a depth of 3 feet or more in most years.  The poorly drained Hoven and Tetonka soils are in closed depressions.  Jerauld soils have a thinner mollic epipedon, salts within 16 inches, and are in similar landscapes positions. Stickney soils do not have columnar structured Btn horizons and are in similar landscapes."
