  "OVERVIEW": "The Datil series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks on fan terraces and piedmonts.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Belfon soils formed in loess on the Great Plains. Cedak, Dagflat, Hargreave, Hiarc, Kirtley, and Recluse soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths between 20 and 40 inches.  Featherlegs and Sugardee soils have loamy-skeletal horizons at depths between 30 and 40 inches. Shalona soils lack secondary carbonates in some part of the Bt horizon. Wolf soils are less than 15 inches deep to the base of the Bt."
