These soils are on uplands and have nearly level to steep slopes. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.\nSOIL FAMILY:  Coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Calcic Haploxerolls.",

The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 degrees to 52 degrees F. Depth to bedrock ranges from40 to 60 inches or more. The solum ranges from 30 to 50 inches thick. Depth to secondary lime ranges from 30 to 43 inches. Rock fragments up to about 1 inch in diameter range from 0 to 5 percent in the A and B horizons.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist. It is silt loam or loam.\nThe B horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist. It is silt loam or loam with 12 to 18 percent clay and 18 to 22 percent sand fragments coarser than very fine sand. The B horizon has up to 10 percent noncalcareous nodules 1/4 to 3/4 inch in diameter. The B3 horizon is weakly calcareous in some pedons."

Disautel soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section and have hard glacial till at depths of less than 40 inches. Kidman soils are moderately and strongly alkaline, have 7.5YR hue and have fine sandy loam and light loam B horizons. Marriott soils average fine sandy loam and have 20 to 35 percent rock fragments in the texture control section. Molcal soils are strongly alkaline in some part and calcareous throughout the profile or below depth of 10 inches.  Tammany Creek soils have in some part and calcareous throughout the profile or below depth of 10 inches. Tammany Creek soils have 5 to 35 percent rock fragments. Timentwa soils have 15 to 50 percent rock fragments in the B2 horizons overlying extremely hard glacial till."

The soils formed in a reworded loess mantle with an appreciable component of volcanic ash over mixed alluvium and colluvium and sedimentary bedrock. Summers are warm and dry. Winters are cool and moist. The mean annual temperature is 48 degrees to 50 degrees F.  Precipitation ranges from 12 to 14 inches annually.
