  "OVERVIEW": "The Deerspring series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on flood plains.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches (280 mm), mostly as winter snows and rain.  Mean annual snowfall is about 45 inches (1140 mm).  Mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F.(9 degrees C.).",
