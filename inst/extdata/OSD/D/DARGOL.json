  "OVERVIEW": "The Dargol series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in fine-textured slope alluvium and residuum from shale and sandstone. Dargol soils are on ridges, mountain slopes, hills and mesas and have 0 to 45 percent slopes. The mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches.",
