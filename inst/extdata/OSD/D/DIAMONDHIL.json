  "OVERVIEW": "The Diamondhil series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from calcareous sandstone with some limestone and conglomerate. Diamondhil soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
