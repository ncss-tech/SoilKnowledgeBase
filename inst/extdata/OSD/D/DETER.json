  "OVERVIEW": "The Deter series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine sediments weathered from tuff, basalt and diatomite. Deter soils are on terraces and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual  temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F. The soils usually are moist but are dry at depths between 4 to 12 inches about 90 to 115 consecutive days when soil temperature is more than 47 degrees F. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick. Rock fragments commonly are lacking but some pedons have up to 30 percent gravel in the lower part of the Bt horizon.  Gravelly and very gravelly substratums occur in some pedons below 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It is slightly acid or neutral.   It is loam, silt loam or clay loam.\nA Bw horizon is present in some pedons and is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam with 22 to 28 percent clay.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. This horizon is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay and averages 35 to 50 percent clay. It commonly has stress oriented fabric throughout the major part. This horizon is neutral through moderately alkaline.  In some pedons, the texture includes silty clay loam or silty clay."

Medford soils have soil temperature of 54 to 57 degrees F. and are dry for 45 to 80 consecutive days. Mindego soils have soil temperature of 55 degrees F.  or warmer, have a comparatively small summer-winter temperature change and have a frost-free period of about 300 days. Nebeker soils have slightly or moderately calcareous C horizons, have 70 to 140 days in the frost-free period and are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days during the summer and autumn."
