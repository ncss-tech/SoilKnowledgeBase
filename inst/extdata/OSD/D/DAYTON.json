Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It has weak to moderate subangular blocky structure, however tillage can result in platy of prismatic structure or destroy structure. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay. It has few to common redox concentrations. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or neutral, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 0 to 2 moist and dry. It has weak to moderate prismatic parting to subangular or angular blocky structure. Texture is clay or silty clay with 40 to 50 percent clay. It has few to many redox concentrations. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2BCt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 0 to 2 moist and dry. It has weak to moderate prismatic or subangular blocky structure and may be massive in the lower part. It has few to many redox concentrations. Texture is clay or silty clay with 40 to 50 percent clay in the upper part and silty clay loam or silt loam with 20 to 35 percent clay in the lower part. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 day, and chroma of 1 to 4 moist and dry. It has weak prismatic structure or is massive.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Adco, Appanoose, Awbrig, Belinda, Chariton, Glensted, Putnum, Rubio, and Wagner series. Adco soils lack a discontinuity and have aquic conditions at a depth of 12 to 30 inches. Appanoose soils lack a discontinuity, have a particle-size control section averaging 48 to 55 percent clay, and a solum depth of greater than 55 inches. Awbrig soils are 5 to 12 inches to a 2Bt argillic horizon, has 50 to 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and lacks an albic horizon. Belinda soils lack a discontinuity and a 3C horizon, and depth to the base of the argillic horizon is greater than 40 inches. Chariton soils lack a discontinuity, have 48 to 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and have a solum dominated by material of loess origin. Glensted soils have a particle-size control section with 1 to 15 percent chert gravel. Putnam soils lack a discontinuity, and have 48 to 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section of loess origin over Kansas till. Rubio soils lack a discontinuity and have 35 to 42 percent clay in the particle-size control section of Wisconsin age loess origin. Wagner soils lack a discontinuity and have Btg horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Dayton soils are on nearly level or somewhat concave, slightly depressed parts of broad valley terraces at elevations of 150 to 400 feet. They formed in silty and clayey glaciolacustrine deposits. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist. Average January temperature is 39 to 40 degrees F., average July temperature is 65 to 67 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches. The frost-free period is 165 to 210 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aloha, Amity, Concord, Holcomb, Willamette, and Woodburn soils. Concord soils do not have an abrupt textural change between the albic and argillic horizons and occur in depressions on terraces. Aloha soils are fine-silty and have aquic conditions with chroma of 2 or less at 10 to 20 inches from the surface. Amity soils are fine-silty and have a mollic epipedon. Holcomb soils have a mollic epipedon and have aquic conditions with chroma of 2 or less at 10 to 20 inches from the surface. Willamette and Woodburn soils are fine-silty and are on higher terraces."
