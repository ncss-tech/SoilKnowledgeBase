They formed in silty and clayey glaciolacustrine deposits. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist. Average January temperature is 39 to 40 degrees F., average July temperature is 65 to 67 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches.
