  "OVERVIEW": "The Deseed series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Deseed soils are on hills, mountains, and plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks with some influence from loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,360 to 2,170 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry, summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."

Freznik soils have an abrupt boundary between the A and Bt horizons with an absolute increase in clay content of 20 percent or more.  Reluctan soils are fine-loamy and have mollic epipedons."
