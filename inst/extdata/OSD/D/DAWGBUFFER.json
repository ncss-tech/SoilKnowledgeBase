  "OVERVIEW": "The Dawgbuffer series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from andesite or tuff. Dawgbuffer soils are on mountains. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
