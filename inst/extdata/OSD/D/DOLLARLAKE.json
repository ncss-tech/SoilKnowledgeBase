  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Dollarlake series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mid-backslopes and footslopes of troughwalls in glaciated mountains. Dollarlake soils formed in till from basalt with an influence of volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 31 degrees F.",
