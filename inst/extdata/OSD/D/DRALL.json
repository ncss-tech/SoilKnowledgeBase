  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Drall series are deep and excessively drained.  They have formed in residuum or colluvium from acid sandstone or quartzite.  Drall soils are on mountain ridges and the upper parts of sideslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F, and average annual precipitation is about 38 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Content of quartzite and sandstone fragments 1/4 to 10 inches in size ranges from 15 to 65 percent by volume in the A horizons, and from 40 to 90 percent in individual subhorizons of the B and C horizons.  These include channers and/or cobbles.  Stones occupy 3 to 50 percent of the soil surface.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 4.  A1 horizons with moist value of 3 are less than 6 inches thick.  The A horizon is loamy sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction The E horizon, where present, has value of 5 through 7 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or sand in the fine earth fraction.  Thin layers or lenses of sandy loam are in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 4 through 8, and may contain mottles.  Textures are sand or loamy sand, in the fine earth fraction, except some pedons in colluvial positions have thin or discontinuous nonconforming horizons below a depth of 40 inches."
