  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Content of quartzite and sandstone fragments 1/4 to 10 inches in size ranges from 15 to 65 percent by volume in the A horizons, and from 40 to 90 percent in individual subhorizons of the B and C horizons.  These include channers and/or cobbles.  Stones occupy 3 to 50 percent of the soil surface.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 4.  A1 horizons with moist value of 3 are less than 6 inches thick.  The A horizon is loamy sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction The E horizon, where present, has value of 5 through 7 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy sand, sand loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or sand in the fine earth fraction.  Thin layers or lenses of sandy loam are in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 4 through 8, and may contain mottles.  Textures are sand or loamy sand, in the fine earth fraction, except some pedons in colluvial positions have thin or discontinuous nonconforming horizons below a depth of 40 inches."

Slopes range from 15 to 70 percent, commonly being between 45 and 70 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1700 to 3200 feet above sea level.  The soils formed in residuum weathered from yellowish and grayish acid quartzite and sandstone.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 degrees to 53 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 40 inches."

The Cataska soils have slaty or very slaty loam or silt loam cambric horizons and are underlain by slate or phyllite.  Hartleton soils have argillic horizons.  Laidig soils have fragipans.  Leetonia soils have spodic horizons.  Sherando soils have gravelly or very gravelly sandy loam cambic horizons.  Laidig and Sherando soils occupy colluvial positions below the Drall soils."
