  "REVDATE": "07/2014",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Deweyville series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in recent alluvium enriched with acid organic materials. These nearly level soils occur in oxbows and poorly defined drainageways. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent but are mainly less than 0.5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1524 mm (60 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).",
