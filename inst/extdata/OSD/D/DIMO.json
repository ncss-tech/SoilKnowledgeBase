  "REVDATE": "03/2009",
  "STATES": "SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Dimo series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy alluvium and the underlying sand and gravel on glacial outwash plains, stream terraces and floodplains. Permeability is moderate in the solum and very rapid in the sand and gravel. Slopes are less than 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches, and mean temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The loamy sediments overlying the sand and gravel typically are 26 to 32 inches thick but range from 20 to 40 inches thick.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 40 inches and extends into the Bw horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; values of 3 or 4, 2 moist; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is loam or clay loam, but some pedons are silt loam or silty clay loam.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y or neutral; value of 3 to 5, 2 to 4 moist; and chroma of 0 to 2.  It typically is clay loam but includes loam or sandy clay loam, with a clay content of 20 to 34 percent.  It has few to many mottles in the lower part.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  Some pedons have a Bg horizon directly above the 2C horizon.  It has colors and textures of the Bw horizon.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Bk or 2Bk horizon with hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 8, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is loam, but some pedons are gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam, clay loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is calcareous sand and gravel (20 to 45 percent by volume) as gravelly sand, gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly sand or very gravelly loamy sand that contains fragments of shale and some fine and ovate-shaped lime segregations that are from 1 inch to over 2 inches in diameter.  Some pedons contain thin lenses of loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam that are less than 4 inches thick. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Some pedons are underlain by glacial drift below depths of 50 inches."

Arlo soils have a calcic horizon and are at the edges of swales.  Blendon, Hand, and Henkin soils are on associated higher uplands and are well drained.  Blendon soils are in swales.  Tetonka soils are in depressions, are in the fine textured family, and have an E horizon."
