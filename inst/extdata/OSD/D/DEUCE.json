  "OVERVIEW": "The Deuce series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in  loess and silty alluvium overlying basalt.  They are on lava plains and  crater rims.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  Permeability is moderately  slow.  Average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average  annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
