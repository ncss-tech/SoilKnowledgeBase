  "OVERVIEW": "The Dill series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from weakly cemented sandstone bedrock of the Elk City Formation of Permian age. These nearly level to strongly sloping soils occur on hillslopes of plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",
