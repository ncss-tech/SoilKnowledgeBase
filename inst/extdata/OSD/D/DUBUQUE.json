  "STATES": "IL,IA,MN,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Dubuque series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in 46 to 91 centimeters (18 to 36 inches) of loess and a thin layer of residuum from limestone bedrock or reddish paleosol high in clay overlying limestone bedrock. These soils are on ridges of narrow interfluves and side slopes on uplands and high structural benches. Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 84 centimeters (33 inches).",
