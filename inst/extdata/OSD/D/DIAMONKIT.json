  "REVDATE": "05/1999",
  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Diamonkit series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  These soils are on gently to strongly sloping strath terrace breaks and on undulating to rolling hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
