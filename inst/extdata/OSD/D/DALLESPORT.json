  "OVERVIEW": "The Dallesport series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in eolian deposits over old alluvial sand and gravel. These soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

The soil moisture control section is dry from 90 to 105 days. The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 16 inches in thickness. The particle-size control section averages 2 to 8 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.\nThe Ap and A horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is fine sandy loam, very cobbly fine sandy loam, cobbly fine sandy loam, or gravelly fine sandy loam. Some areas have from 1 to 20 percent surface stones.\nThe Bw or 2Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry. Texture is gravely sandy loam, gravelly fine sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam, with 5 to 40 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2BC horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It has 30 to 45 percent gravel, 5 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 3 percent stones. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 3C horizon has value of 5 to 7 moist, 6 to 8 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist or dry.
