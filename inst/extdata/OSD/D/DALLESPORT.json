The soil moisture control section is dry from 90 to 105 days. The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 16 inches in thickness. The particle-size control section averages 2 to 8 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.\nThe Ap and A horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is fine sandy loam, very cobbly fine sandy loam, cobbly fine sandy loam, or gravelly fine sandy loam. Some areas have from 1 to 20 percent surface stones.\nThe Bw or 2Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry. Texture is gravely sandy loam, gravelly fine sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam, with 5 to 40 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2BC horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It has 30 to 45 percent gravel, 5 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 3 percent stones. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 3C horizon has value of 5 to 7 moist, 6 to 8 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist or dry.
