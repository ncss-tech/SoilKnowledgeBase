  "OVERVIEW": "The Detra series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, or eolian deposits, over residuum derived from sedimentary rocks.  Detra soils are on hills, hillslopes, toeslopes, mesas, and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
