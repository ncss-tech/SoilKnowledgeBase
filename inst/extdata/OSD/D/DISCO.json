  "OVERVIEW": "The Disco series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in wind re-worked loamy and sandy alluvial sediments. Disco soils are on stream and outwash terraces on major drainageways.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 10.6 degrees C (51 degrees F).",

Disco is no longer correlated in Henderson Co., IL.\nClassification was changed to Pachic (lab data does not fit Cumulic).  The Pachic subgroup was added per update to Taxonomy in the Eighth Edition, 1998 Keys to Soil Taxonomy\nAdditional data: Data from the National Soil Survey Lab and the Pedology Laboratory at the University of Illinois, are on file for several pedons.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
