Disco soils formed in loamy and sandy alluvial sediments that have been re-deposited by wind. They are not normally subject to flooding.  Summers are hot and winters are cold. Mean annual temperature is about 10 to 12.8 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is between 890 and 1016 mm. (35 and 40 inches)."

Disco is no longer correlated in Henderson Co., IL.\nClassification was changed to Pachic (lab data does not fit Cumulic).  The Pachic subgroup was added per update to Taxonomy in the Eighth Edition, 1998 Keys to Soil Taxonomy\nAdditional data: Data from the National Soil Survey Lab and the Pedology Laboratory at the University of Illinois, are on file for several pedons.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
