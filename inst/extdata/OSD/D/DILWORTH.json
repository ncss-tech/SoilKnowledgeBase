  "OVERVIEW": "The Dilworth series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in residual material weathered from gray Permian shale. These gently sloping to strongly sloping soils are on hillslopes on uplands in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 80A).  Slopes range from 3 to 12 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 60 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 32 inches.",
