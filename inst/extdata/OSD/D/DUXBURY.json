  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the mineral solum and depth to the C or 2C horizon range from 16 to 30 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Rock fragments are mostly gravel and cobbles and typically range from 0 to 20 percent in the upper mineral solum and 0 to 30 percent in the lower solum. The substratum ranges from 15 to 70 percent in the substratum, but the weighted average in the particle size control section is less than 35 percent. Some pedons have subhorizons of the substratum that have less than 15 percent rock fragments. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the upper part of the mineral solum and from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum.\nThe O horizon, where present, is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 0 through 3. It is fibric, hemic or sapric material.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 4. Some pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. The A or Ap horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bhs horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, with value and chroma of 3 or less. Some pedons have a Bh horizon that is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. The Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, with value or chroma of 4 or more. The Bhs and Bh horizons are silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. The Bs horizon is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy fine sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture range is the same as the Bs horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. It is loamy sand, sand, or fine to coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Adams, Cusino, Fishcreek (T), Kalkaska, Liminga, Pence, and Stutts series are in this family. All except Adams and Fishcreek (T) occur outside region 12. Adams soils have coarser textures in the solum and generally have fewer rock fragments. The Cusino, Kalkaska, Liminga, Pense, and Stutts soils have dry soil moisture status within 91 centimeters of the soil surface in the month of August. Fishcreek (T) soils are formed in sandy glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine deposits derived from predominantly sedimentary source material.\nThe Allagash, Colton and Monadnock series are in related families. Colton soils have a sandy-skeletal particle size class. Allagash and Monadnock soils have a coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal particle size class."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Duxbury soils are on terraces, eskers, kames, and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. The soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits with a loamy mantle. The deposits are derived primarily from gneiss, schist and granite. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 50 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F. The frost free season ranges from 90 to 135 days."

Adams, Allagash and Colton soils are on the same landforms as Duxbury soils. Adams soils have coarser textures in the solum and generally have fewer rock fragments. Allagash soils have less than 35 percent gravel in the substratum. Colton soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Croghan soils are on nearby, slightly lower landforms. They have redoximorphic features within 30 inches of the mineral soil surface."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: 1. The classification is changed from the previous classification was Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Typic Haplorthods. Some soils mapped Duxbury in the past met the old classification and need to be reevaluated.\n2.Duxbury is frigid and its use in MLRA 144A is relict. It will be replaced as mapping is updated.\n3. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (Oe and E horizons).\nb. Albic horizon - the zone from 0 to 5 inches (E horizon).\nc. Spodic horizon - the zone from 5 to 16 inches (Bh and Bhs horizons).\n3. Sandy particle-size class - the weighted average texture of the fine earth fraction of the particle-size control section (10 to 40 inches) is loamy coarse sand.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL laboratory data is available for the following pedons: S77VT-15-5 and S77VT-15-7.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
