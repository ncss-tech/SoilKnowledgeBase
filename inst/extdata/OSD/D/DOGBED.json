Bullvaro, Dooh, Nutval, and Vetagrande soils have an aridic moisture regime.  Burchflat and Vipont soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Camelback soils have rock fragments which are mainly quartzite and are dominated by cobbles in the particle-size control section.  Chrisflat soils have mollic epipedons that are 50 to 76 cm thick.  Erig soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Krenka soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Leroman and Staberg soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Lockgate soils are deep to paralithic contacts.  Murain soils are dominated by stones and cobbles and average 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Snyderville soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon of less than 90 cm.  Softback soils average 25 to 32 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have mollic epipedons that do not include the upper Bt horizons.  Softscrabble soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dogbed soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in colluvium derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,770 to 2,740 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 600 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 127 cm (A1, A2, Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 36 to 152 cm (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 36 to 86 cm (Bt1 horizon and part of the Bt2 horizon).\nThe revision of October 2003 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Pachic Argixerolls.  The isotic mineralogy class was based solely on the field determined values for sodium fluoride pH.  Laboratory data on 15 bar water to clay ratio does not exist to verify the isotic mineralogy class.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
