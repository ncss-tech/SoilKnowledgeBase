Burbank, Doowak, and Wrango soils have Bk horizons within 100 cm of the soil surface.  Crunkvar soils have mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 14 degrees C. and are moist 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms.  Sheeprock soils are calcareous and have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 10 degrees C.  Skaha soils have less than half of the total rock fragments between 2 and 5 mm in diameter.  Ulymeyer soils have mean annual soil temperature of 14 to 15 degrees C. and are dominated by cobbles and stones in the particle-size control section."
