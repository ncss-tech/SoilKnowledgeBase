  "OVERVIEW": "The Dorna series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in silty materials over clayey alluvial sediments on terraces.  Permeability is moderate through the silty material and slow below.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The upper part of the series control section is silt loam or very fine sandy loam averaging less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  Depth to the clayey 2C materials typically is about 24 to 30 inches, but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Some pedons have buried A horizons.  These soils typically have free carbonates at depths of 4 to 10 inches, but in some pedons free carbonates are at the surface.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2.  It typically is silt loam, but is very fine sandy loam in some pedons.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a value of 4 moist in the lower part of the A horizon.\nThe C horizon has 10YR hue, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam and is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist; and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has few to many, very fine to coarse accumulations of carbonate.  The 2C horizon is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam with a clay content of 35 to 50 percent clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It typically has few to common, very fine or fine accumulations of salts in the lower part."
