  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the paralithic contact and bedrock is typically 23 to 30 inches but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Solum thickness when a B horizon is present is 4 to 10 inches.  Continuous horizons of carbonate accumulations are normally absent though the soil contains from 5 to 15 percent authigenic carbonate throughout.  Some movement of carbonates and accumulations in the substrata may occur but are discontinuous.  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 47 degrees F., and the mean annual summer soil temperature exceeds 59 and is normally less than 64 degrees F. The moisture control section is usually dry, but is moist in some parts for 30 to 50 cumulative days between June 10 and October 10. Salinity of the entire soil is less than 4 mmhos/cm.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  This horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline. In some areas the surface has a gravel lag.\nThe B or AC horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  This horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, loam, or silt loam and averages 20 to 35 percent clay, 28 to 58 percent silt, and 15 to 50 percent sand with more than 15 percent being fine sand or coarser.  Coarse fragments commonly range from 0 to 15 percent and commonly consist of soft shale chips less than 2 inches in diameter.  Over 90 percent of these chips will break down upon pretreatment.  This horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Delphill soils are on benches, hillslopes, pediments,  ridges, and rolling uplands. Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent.  Elevations range from 5,500 to 8000 feet.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches and falls mainly during spring and early summer.  The mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 59 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free season is erratic but normally ranges from 60 to 110 days depending upon elevation, aspect, and air drainage."

Blazon soils occur intermixed on the same landscape and on the more steeply sloping areas on escarpment faces.  They have a paralithic contact above a depth of 20 inches.  Diamondville soils occur further downslope on more stable positions and have an argillic horizon."
