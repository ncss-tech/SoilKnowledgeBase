    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from a depth of 0 to 8 cm.\nArtifacts - the zone from a depth of 18 to 140 cm.\nHuman-transported materials - the zone from a depth of 0 to 160 cm.\nParticle-size control section - the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 cm.\nSome pedons have sandy textured horizons near the surface to improve drainage and infiltration. Soil structure and secondary carbonate in the human-transported materials are considered geogenic and not pedongenic in nature having been formed prior to transport of material. Some pedons also have clay films that are discontinuous and not oriented.\nTaxonomic subgroup tagged as typic due to presence of human-transported materials.  The soil has occurs on appropriate landforms and has soil properties that support the concept of human-transported materials.  The use of the Anthroportic subgroup is not currently permitted in the xeric soil moisture regime, but will be explored for future consideration for correlation.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nUser site ID: 2015CA6961231\nClassified using the Twelfth Edition Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2014)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
