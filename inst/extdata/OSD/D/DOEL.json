The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F.  The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 41 degrees F from about March 15 to December 1 (255 days) and is above 47 degrees F from about April 15 to November 15 (210 days).  The soil between depths of 8 to duripan or 24 inches is dry in all parts from June 10 to November 15 (155 days).  The moisture control section is dry more than half the time the soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F.  Gravel range from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/1 or 6/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4 or 4/2.  Clay content ranges from 5 to 15 percent.  The reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/1, 6/2, 6/3 or 7/2 and moist color or 10YR 4/2, 4/3 or 2.5Y 4/2.  The Bt has 6 to 17 percent clay with about 1 to 2 percent more clay content than the A horizon.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 6/2, 6/3, 7/1, 7/2 or 8/2 and moist color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3 or 2.5Y 4/2.
