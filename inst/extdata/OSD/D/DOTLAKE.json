  "STATUS": "Established Series",

  "REVDATE": "11/2002",
  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Dotlake series consists of poorly drained soils formed in micaceous silty or loamy materials over sand.  Dotlake soils are in depressions on\nsandy outwash plains and swales between low dunes adjoining the plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 27 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 12 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The upper 10 to 15 inches ranges from silt loam to sandy loam.  Thickness and number of silty or loamy lenses in the 2C horizon is highly variable.  Depth to perennially frozen soil ranges from 5 to more than 40 inches, depending on the thickness of the O horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Batza, Bradway, and Tanana series in the same family.  Batza soils are not stratified and do not have substantial mica content.  Bradway soils have mucky surface horizons.  Tanana soils have less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser throughout the control section."

The mean annual temperature ranges from 24 to 32 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation from 10 to 20 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Bradway and Tanana soils, and the Beales, Nenana, Teklanika, and Volkmar soils.  Beales and Teklanika soils are on uplands and are dominantly sandy.  Nenana soils have a loess cap over a sandy or sandy-skeletal substratum.  Volkmar soils formed in loess over a sandy or sandy-skeletal substratum, and have mottles in a high chroma matrix."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Dotlake soils in the Salcha-Big Delta soil survey (1973) were correlated as Tanana silt loam, sand subsoil variant because of low acreage.  The Dotlake series is poorly defined and overlaps several other permafrost soils and \"thawing\" phases (jpm, 11/86).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
