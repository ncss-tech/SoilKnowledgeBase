(Oese horizon)\nSapric soil materials--the zone from 16 to 62 centimeters centimeters (6 to 24 inches). (Oase1 and Oase2 horizons)\nPeraquic conditions--continuous endosaturation with very frequent tidal flooding.\nHyposulfidic soil materials--sulfurous odors and incubated pH decrease greater than 1.0 unit and remains above 4.0, the zone from the soil surface to 200 centimeters."
