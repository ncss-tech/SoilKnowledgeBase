  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the underlying material and depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Depth to mineral layers ranges from 16 to 51 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the O layers and from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the A and C horizons.  Upon drying reaction is slightly lower in the organic layers.  Sodium Absorption Ratio (SAR) is more than 13.  Delway soils are strongly saline and electrical conductivity is more than 16 millimhos per centimeter.\nThe O horizons has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2, or hue of N and value of 2 or 3.  The organic materials are dominantly sapric material (muck) derived mainly from herbaceous fiber.  The unrubbed fiber content ranges from about 10 to 30 percent and rubbed fiber content is less than about 15 percent.  Some pedons have thin (less than 5 inches thick) surface layers that are hemic (mucky peat) or fibric (peat) materials.\nThe Ag horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, or hue of N, value of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.  Where present, iron depletions are in shades of gray and iron accumulations are in shades of red, brown, yellow, and olive.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, or hue of N, value of 4 to 6.  Texture is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Iron depletions are in shades of gray and iron accumulations are in shades of red, brown, yellow, and olive.  Some pedons have a reduced matrix and undergo a change in hue upon exposure to air."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Mattan and the Shinkee series.  Mattan soils formed in herbaceous and woody plant remains and are influenced primarily by freshwater.  Shinkee soils have mean annual precipitation of less than 16 inches.  Similar soils in related families are the Belhaven, Currituck, Croatan, Pamlico, and Ponzer.  Belhaven, Croatan, Pamlico, and Ponzer soils are more acid.  Currituck soils are underlain by sandy fluvial sediments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Delway soils are on low-lying brackish marshes of the Lower Coastal Plain.  They formed in a mixture of herbaceous plant remains underlain by loamy fluvial and marine sediments.  These soils are subject to wind tides and storm surges.  Elevation typically is at sea level, and is to 2 feet or less.  Slope is 1 percent or less.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 70 degrees F., the frost free season ranges from 215 to 250 days, and the average annual precipitation ranges from 46 to 58 inches."

Surface runoff is very slow to ponded.  The water level is at or above the soil surface throughout the year.  Wind tides and storm tides may cause inundation up to 5 feet."
