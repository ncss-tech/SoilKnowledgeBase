Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1143 mm (40 to 45 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 170 to 190 days.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Deputy series has been separated out of soils previously included with the Trappist series. The original concept of this series allowed it to form in an intervening layer of till. Data collected as of March 1995 indicates the intervening layer of till to be a map unit inclusion. Because Deputy soils are adjacent to soils on the till plain, it is common to find a few glacial pebbles in the middle part of the series control section (2Bt). Geological Survey Bulletin 44 from the Indiana Dept. of Natural Resources gives information on the stratigraphy of the New Albany Shale in Indiana. A severely eroded phase is recognized.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from 0 to 20 cm (8 inches) (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from 20 to 135 cm (8 to 53 inches) (Bt, 2Bt and 2Btg horizons).\nParalithic contact: at 135 cm (53 inches) (2Cr horizon).\nLithic contact: at 196 cm (77 inches).\nRedoximorphic depletions: from 38 to 135 cm (15 to 53 inches).\nThe representative component and horizon data is in DMU# 124497.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data for pedons S87IN143-13, S89IN143-2 and S80IN-77-4 (partial data for typical pedon) is on file at the National Soil Survey Lab in Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
