  "OVERVIEW": "The Dakota series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loamy alluvium and in the underlying sandy outwash.  These soils are on outwash plains, stream terraces, and valley trains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 870 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
