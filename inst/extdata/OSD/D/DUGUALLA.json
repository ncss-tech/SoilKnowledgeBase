  "OVERVIEW": "The Dugualla series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in herbaceous organic deposits.  Dugualla soils are in natural and protected (relict) lagoons and depressions of marine shore complexes with slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 710 millimeters and average annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
