    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dugualla soils are in natural and protected (relict) lagoons and depressions of marine shore complexes with slopes of 0 to 2 percent at elevations of 0 to 2 meters.  They formed in salt water influenced herbaceous organic deposits.  The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and mild moist winters.  Annual precipitation ranges from 455 to 1,015 millimeters.  Average annual temperature ranges from 9 to 11 degrees C.  The frost-free period is about 200 to 240 days."

Dugualla soils that are drained or protected by tide gates can have a water table at or above the soil surface from November through May.  Unprotected or un-drained Dugualla soils will have a water table fluctuating with tide levels at or above the soil surface throughout the year.  In areas that are drained or protected by tide gates, the water table can drop to below 60 cm from June through October."
