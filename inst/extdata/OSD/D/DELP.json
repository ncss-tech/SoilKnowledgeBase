Granshaw soils have an argillic horizon with sandy loam or coarse sandy loam matrix. Mayqueen soils are noncalcareous.  Shiprock soils have a noncalcareous solum and are sandy loam to 152 cm. Wallson soils are sandy loam or fine sandy loam to 152 cm and have a noncalcareous solum.  Woolsey soils are sandy or gravelly sandy loam to 152 cm."
