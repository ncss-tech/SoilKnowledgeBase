  "OVERVIEW": "The Deaver series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from shale.  Deaver soils are on hills and ridges.  Slopes range from 3 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
