  "OVERVIEW": "The Drewing series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Drewing soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
