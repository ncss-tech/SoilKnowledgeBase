Organic matter is less than 1 percent throughout the profile.  Depth to carbonates is 20 to 35 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It has 0 to 30 percent rock fragments.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.
