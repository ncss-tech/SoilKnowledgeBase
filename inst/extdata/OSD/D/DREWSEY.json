  "OVERVIEW": "The Drewsey series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material and colluvium from tuffaceous sediments and mudflow deposits.  Drewsey soils are on hills and hillsides.  Slopes are 1 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is greater than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 10 to 18 percent clay, 35 to 60 percent fine sand or coarser material and 0 to 10 percent rock fragments.  Organic matter is less than 1 percent throughout the profile.  Depth to carbonates is 20 to 35 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It has 0 to 30 percent rock fragments.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.
