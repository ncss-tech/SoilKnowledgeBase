  "STATES": "ID,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils.  These soils formed in alluvium, deltaic material and lacustrine deposits from quartzite, limestone and sandstone on lake terraces and bars.  Slope is 0 to 10 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature at 20 inches ranges from 68 to 70 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry for 60 to 90 consecutive days in all parts of the moisture control section.  They are moist more than 50 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. in some part of the moisture control section.  The soil moisture regime is xeric bordering on aridic.\nThe mollic epipedon is 20 to 36 inches thick.  The depth to very gravelly or cobbly material ranges from 14 to 20 inches.  Coarse fragments are mainly gravel with some cobble size subrounded quartzite, sandstone and limestone fragments, and generally increase in volume with depth ranging from 20 to 35 percent in the A horizons, 30 to 75 percent in the B horizons, and 50 to 90 percent in the C horizons.  The control section averages very gravelly loam.  The depth to a layer of carbonate accumulation ranges from 20 to 36 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is noncalcareous and is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe B horizon is noncalcareous.  Hue, value, and chroma range is the same as the A horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is very gravelly, extremely gravelly, or very cobbly loam, silt loam or sandy loam with 60 to 90 percent coarse fragments.  It ranges from mildly to strongly alkaline and is moderately to strongly calcareous and weakly cemented in some pedons."

Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent but mainly are 3 to 6 percent.  These soils formed in very gravelly and cobbly alluvium, deltaic materials and reworked lacustrine deposits dominantly from quartzite, sandstone, and limestone rocks.  The climate is dry subhumid, with an average annual precipitation ranging from 12 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 65 to 70 degrees F.  The frost free season ranges from 110 to 140 days."

Hupp soils are calcareous in the A horizon and the mollic epipedon is less than 20 inches thick.  Middle soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick.   Parleys and Timanogos soils have argillic horizons and lack coarse fragments in the control sections.  Sterling soils are calcareous in the A1 horizons and have calcic horizons immediately below the mollic epipedon and lack cambic horizons."
