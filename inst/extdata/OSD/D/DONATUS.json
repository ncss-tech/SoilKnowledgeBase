  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock range from 20 to 40 inches.  The thickness of the loess ranges from 10 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon, where present, is 3 to 5 inches thick and is very dark gray (10YR 3/1), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) or very dark brown (10YR 2/2).  The Ap horizon is brown (10YR 4/3) or dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4).  Clay content of the A or Ap horizon ranges from 13 to 26 percent.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, gravelly silt loam, or gravelly silty clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 32 percent.  The content of rock fragments ranges from 15 to 30 percent by volume. Most rock fragments are chert.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  It is very gravelly silty clay or very gravelly clay with a clay content that ranges from 45 to 80 percent.  The content of rock fragments ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  Some pedons have thin 2Bt horizons in which the content of rock fragments ranges from 15 to 35 percent by volume. Most rock fragments are chert."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Donatus soils are on strongly sloping ridges and strongly sloping to steep side slopes on uplands.  Slopes range from 9 to 25 percent.  Donatus soils formed in a thin layer of loess and clayey residuum with a high chert content over dolomitic limestone bedrock.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 45 to 54 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from about 32 to 36 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dubuque, Fayette, Nordness, and Rollingstone soils in similar positions on the landscape.  Dubuque soils have a thinner layer of clayey residuum and contain less coarse fragments.  Fayette soils formed in loess.  Nordness soils have a lithic contact within 20 inches of the surface.  Rollingstone soils have a lithic contact greater than 60 inches."
