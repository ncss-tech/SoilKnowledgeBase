Crooked Creek and Welch soils have mollic epipedons, frigid temperature regimes, and are noneffervescent throughout their profiles.  Deepeek soils are well drained and have argillic horizons overlying a duripan. Ocala soils are somewhat poorly drained and have exchangeable sodium that is greater than 15 percent in more than half of the upper 50 cm of the soil profile."
