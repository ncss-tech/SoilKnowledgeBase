  "OVERVIEW": "The Datemark series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone. Datemark soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 30 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
