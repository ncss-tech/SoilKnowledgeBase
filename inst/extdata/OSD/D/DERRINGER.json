Mean annual soil\ntemperature is about 42 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to a\nparalithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the Bt\nhorizon is 10 to 20 inches.  Coarse fragments range from 35\nto 80 percent in the textural control section.  The mollic\nepipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The solum ranges from\nneutral to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and\nchroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 30 to 50 percent\ngravel and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma\nof 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silty clay, clay or heavy\nclay loam, averaging 35 to 50 percent clay.  It has 40 to 65\npercent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobbles."
