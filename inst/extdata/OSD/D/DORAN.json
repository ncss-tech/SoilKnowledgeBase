    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates typically is 15 to 20 inches and ranges from 12 to 24 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches.  The particle-size control section contains more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser sand.  The depth to the underlying glacial till ranges from 15 to 40 inches.  The underlying glacial till averages more than 20 percent fine sand and coarser sand and from 3 to 10 percent rock fragments.  It is dominated by textures of loam and clay loam above depths of 40 inches, but may contain strata of other textures above this depth.  Below depths of 40 inches textures include loam, clay loam, silt loam, silty clay loam and very fine sandy loam.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4 dry, and chroma of 1.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay loam or loam.  It is neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is clay loam, clay, silty clay or silty clay loam averaging 35 to 50 percent clay and contains a few rock fragments.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons contain faint or distinct redoximorphic features.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It contains 15 to 35 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nThe BC and C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  They contain about 30 to 40 percent clay and 3 to 10 percent rock fragments. They are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  They do not have gypsum in some pedons.  The BC horizon is clay loam and the C horizon is loam or clay loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Doran soils are on level and nearly level lake plains and water modified till plains.  The soils formed in thin lacustrine or water worked till sediments over firm glacial till.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent.  The climate is cool subhumid.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 19 to 23 inches.  Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer."

Antler soils are on similar landscapes and do not have argillic horizons.  Clearwater and Fargo soils are on nearby lake plains and are poorly drained.  In addition, Fargo soils contain 45 to 60 percent clay and do not have coarse fragments.  Enloe and Tonka soils are in shallow depressions on nearby lake plains.  They are poorly drained and have distinct E horizons.  Forman soils are on nearby till uplands and Kittson soils are on similar nearby landscapes to Doran soils.  They are fine-loamy.  In addition, Forman soils are well drained and do not have redox features within depths of 30 inches and Kittson soils do not have argillic horizons.  Hegne soils are on nearby lake plains.  They do not have Bt horizons and have calcic horizons within depths of 16 inches.  Lankin soils are on nearby similar landscapes and have mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick."
