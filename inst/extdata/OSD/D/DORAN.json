Below depths of 40 inches textures include loam, clay loam, silt loam, silty clay loam and very fine sandy loam.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4 dry, and chroma of 1.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay loam or loam.  It is neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is clay loam, clay, silty clay or silty clay loam averaging 35 to 50 percent clay and contains a few rock fragments.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons contain faint or distinct redoximorphic features.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is clay loam.
