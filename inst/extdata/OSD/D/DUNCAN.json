    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Duncan soils are on level to nearly level alkali flats bordering playas.  Slopes range from 0 to .5 percent, but may have uneven microrelief due to wind shifting of the surface soil.  The soils formed in old lake and fan deposited alluvium from mixed sources including rhyolite, andesite, quartzite, granite, and limestone.   Duncan soils are at elevations of 3,800 to 4,300 feet in a warm, semiarid continental climate.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 58 degrees to 66 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from 155 to 220 days.  The annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 12 inches and occurs as thundershowers from July through September and as gentle fall and winter rains.  The months of May and June are usually warm and dry."
