The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 55 to 60 degrees F.  The solum and mollic epipedon is 24 to 35 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is over 60 inches.  The upper part of the particle-size control section has an average of 20 to 35 percent clay with more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  The lower part has 5 to 12 percent clay, over 70 percent sand and 15 to 70 percent coarse fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 0 or 1 moist and dry.  The upper 4 to 10 inches is compacted in places.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay and 0 to 5 percent gravel.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR and 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 0 thorough 2 dry.  It is stratified clay, silty clay loam, clay loam, or loam with 25 to 45 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.
