  "OVERVIEW": "The Dacono series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvial parent materials with some modification in the upper part by loess deposits. Dacono soils are on high terraces and have slopes of 0 to 6 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 52 degrees F. The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches and depth to calcareous material typically ranges from 8 to 20 inches. Thickness of the solum commonly ranges from 15 to 40 inches, and depth to the contrasting gravel and sand substratum ranges from 20 to 35 inches. The soil is 80 to 100 percent base saturated. Cation exchange capacity of the Bt horizon ranges from approximately 60 to 80 milliequivalents per 100 grams of clay. Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in the solum and range from 36 to 80 percent in the substratum and includes pebbles, cobble and a few stones.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. Usually the horizon has a granular or crumb structure, but it has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  It ranges from soft to slightly hard.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue from 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is typically heavy clay loam or light clay and has 35 to 50 percent clay. This horizon ranges from prismatic to subangular and angular blocky. It is neutral in the upper part and moderately alkaline in the lower part.\nThe contrasting 2Ck horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR. It has 6 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. The horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
