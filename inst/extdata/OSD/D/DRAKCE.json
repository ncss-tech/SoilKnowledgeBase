  "OVERVIEW": "The Drakce series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from basalt and tuff.  Drakce soils are on escarpments on plateaus.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
