    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to\n40 inches.  Coarse fragments range from none to 50 percent in\nthe upper parts of the solum and form 40 to 70 percent in the\nlower parts of the solum and in the substratum.  In some pedons subhorizons of loamy sand or sand free of coarse fragments\noccur in the control section.\nThe A1 horizons have hues of 5YR through 10YR or are neutral,\nvalues of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  They are fine sandy\nloam through loamy sand in the fine earth fraction.  They\nare very friable or friable.  Some pedons have Ap horizons\nwhich have values ranging from 3 to 5 and are similar in\nother features to the A1 horizons.  The A1 and Ap horizons\nrange from extremely acid to medium acid.\nThe A2 horizons have hues of 5YR through 10YR, values of 4 to\n7 in value and chroma of 1 to 3.  They are loamy fine sand to\nsand in the fine earth fraction.  They have weak or moderate\nfine or medium granular structure or they are massive or\nsingle grain.  They are loose or very friable.  They are\nextremely acid to medium acid.\nThe B2h horizons have hues of 2.5YR through 10YR, and values\nand chroma of 2 or 3.  They are fine sandy loam through sand\nin the fine earth fraction.  They are massive and consistence\nis friable between dominant firm or very firm irregularly\nshaped cemented bodies.  They range from very strongly to\nmedium acid.\nThe B2ir horizons have hues of 5YR through 10YR, values of\n3 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.  They have few to many mottles.\nThey are loamy fine sand to sand in the fine earth fraction.\nThey have weak granular or subangular blocky structure, or\nthe material is structureless.  They are loose to firm.\nThey range from very strongly to medium acid.\nThe C horizons have hues of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, values of\n3 to 5 and chroma of 1 to 3.  They are fine sand or sand in\nthe fine earth fraction.  They range from very strongly to\nmedium acid."

The Colton, Crogham, Fahey,\nHermon, Naumburg, Waiska, and Wallace series are similar\nsoils in related families.  Constable soils lack mottles\nin the lower part of the B2 horizon.  Colton, Fahey, Hermon,\nand Waiska soils lack Bh horizons that are cemented.\nCrogham and Naumburg soils are essentially free of coarse\nfragments and lack B horizons that are cemented.  Wallace\nsoils are essentially free of coarse fragments."

The water table fluc-\ntuates to within less than two feet of the surface.  The soils\nformed in glacial outwash sand and gravel derived mainly\nfrom sandstone, granite and gneiss.  Mean annual temperature\nranges from 38 degrees to 44 degrees F.; mean annual pre-\ncipitation from 35 to 50 inches; and mean frost-free season\nfrom 90 to 130 days."
