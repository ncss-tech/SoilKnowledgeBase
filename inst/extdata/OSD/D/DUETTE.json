  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Duette soils are on slightly elevated knolls and ridges in flatwoods areas on the Lower Coastal Plain of Florida.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent and are generally convex.  They formed in thick beds of sandy marine sediments.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches, and the average annual air temperature ranges from 70 to 74 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cassia, Immokalee, Myakka, Pomello, Pomona, and Tavares series.  The somewhat poorly drained Cassia soils are on slightly lower positions and have a Bh horizon within 30 inches of the soil surface.  The very poorly to poorly drained Immokalee, Myakka, and Pomona soils are on lower positions.  In addition, Immokalee soils have a Bh horizon that is 30 to 50 inches deep while Myakka and Pomona soils have a Bh horizon within 30 inches of the surface and Pomona sols have an underlying Bt horizon.  The somewhat poorly to moderately well drained Pomello soils are on similar positions and have a Bh horizon that is 30 to 50 inches deep.  Tavares soils are on similar to slightly lower positions, are sandy throughout, and do not have a Bh horizon."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Duette soils are in scrub vegetation and used for wildlife habitat.  Some areas are used for building sites.  The natural vegetation is chiefly sand pine, sand live oak, rosemary, sawpalmetto, running oak, pricklypear cactus, fetterbush, and pineland threeawn.  Slash pine grows in some areas."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 66 inches (A, E1, E2, and EB horizons).\nAlbic horizon - the zone from 3 to 66 inches (E1, E2, and EB horizons).\nSpodic horizon - the zone from 66 to 80 inches (Bh horizon).\nDuette soils were formerly mapped as a variant of the Pomello series or were included with the St. Lucie series in some of the older surveys.\nThe water table is usually at depths of 4 to 6 feet from 1 month to 4 months during the summer and fall months.  It is below these depths most of the rest of each year.  After heavy or prolonged rain it rises above these depths briefly.\nData:  Soil Characterization Laboratory, IFAS, UF S28-3-(1-5), S66-29-(1-6); University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
