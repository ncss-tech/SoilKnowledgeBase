  "OVERVIEW": "The Duette series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils on slightly elevated knolls of ridges in flatwoods areas of the Lower Coastal Plains of Florida.  They formed in thick beds of sandy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",

The average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches, and the average annual air temperature ranges from 70 to 74 degrees F."

The somewhat poorly drained Cassia soils are on slightly lower positions and have a Bh horizon within 30 inches of the soil surface.  The very poorly to poorly drained Immokalee, Myakka, and Pomona soils are on lower positions.  In addition, Immokalee soils have a Bh horizon that is 30 to 50 inches deep while Myakka and Pomona soils have a Bh horizon within 30 inches of the surface and Pomona sols have an underlying Bt horizon.  The somewhat poorly to moderately well drained Pomello soils are on similar positions and have a Bh horizon that is 30 to 50 inches deep.  Tavares soils are on similar to slightly lower positions, are sandy throughout, and do not have a Bh horizon."

The natural vegetation is chiefly sand pine, sand live oak, rosemary, sawpalmetto, running oak, pricklypear cactus, fetterbush, and pineland threeawn.  Slash pine grows in some areas."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 66 inches (A, E1, E2, and EB horizons).\nAlbic horizon - the zone from 3 to 66 inches (E1, E2, and EB horizons).\nSpodic horizon - the zone from 66 to 80 inches (Bh horizon).\nDuette soils were formerly mapped as a variant of the Pomello series or were included with the St. Lucie series in some of the older surveys.\nThe water table is usually at depths of 4 to 6 feet from 1 month to 4 months during the summer and fall months.  It is below these depths most of the rest of each year.  After heavy or prolonged rain it rises above these depths briefly.\nData:  Soil Characterization Laboratory, IFAS, UF S28-3-(1-5), S66-29-(1-6); University of Florida, Gainesville, FL."
