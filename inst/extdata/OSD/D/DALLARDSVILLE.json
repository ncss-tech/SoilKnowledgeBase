    "content": "REMARKS:  The type location was moved from Polk County to Hardin County in 1997. The geographic setting was changed from a convex ridge to a mound to reflect the majority of the series province.  The series classification was changed from Plinthic Paleudults to Oxyaquic Paleudults 10/1999. The series was updted in July 2011 during the update of MLRA 152B.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedons are:\nOchric epipedon--0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 in) (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon--97 to 203 cm (38 to 80 in) (Bt/E, Bt/Eg, and Btx/Eg horizons)\nFragipan--155 to 203 cm (61 to 80 in) (Btx/Eg horizons)\nGlossic horizon--53 to 203 cm (21 to 80 in) (E/Bt, Bt/Eg, Btx/Eg. The glossic horizon is series criteria but not diagnostic for classification.)\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Data from Texas A&M University Soil Characterization Lab on samples (S95TX-199-002 and S96TX-199-009).
