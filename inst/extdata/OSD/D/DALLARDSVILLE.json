  "OVERVIEW": "The Dallardsville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils. These nearly level soils are on mounds that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits derived from the Lissie Formation of early Pleistocene age. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1321 mm (52 in).",

The series classification was changed from Plinthic Paleudults to Oxyaquic Paleudults 10/1999. The series was updted in July 2011 during the update of MLRA 152B.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedons are:\nOchric epipedon--0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 in) (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon--97 to 203 cm (38 to 80 in) (Bt/E, Bt/Eg, and Btx/Eg horizons)\nFragipan--155 to 203 cm (61 to 80 in) (Btx/Eg horizons)\nGlossic horizon--53 to 203 cm (21 to 80 in) (E/Bt, Bt/Eg, Btx/Eg.
