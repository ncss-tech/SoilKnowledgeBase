  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Daphsue soils are on mountain shoulders and upper mountain backslopes. They formed in colluvium or residuum derived from loess and mixed metamorphic, volcanic or igneous rocks. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 2,000 to 3,250 meters. Climate is cold, semiarid with cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm that comes largely as winter snow. Windblown snow from mountain ridges and broad linear backslopes accumulates at these locations producing a longer lasting snow-load than most adjacent areas.  The mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C and the frost-free period is 40 to 70."
