These soils are usually moist in the moisture control section but are dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The mollic epipedon is 14 to 20 inches thick and has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.35 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, including 2 to 15 percent ash, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent, and 5 to 14 percent apparent field textured clay content. The lower part of the particle-size control section contains from 35 to 45 percent rock fragments and 5 to 15 percent field estimated clay. Depth to secondary carbonates is 30 to 44 inches. Depth to the loamy-skeletal discontinuity is 14 to 20 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 moist.\nThe A horizon has hue from 10YR to 2.5Y dry, value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 moist. Textures are gravelly ashy fine sandy loam or very stony ashy loam. Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bw1 has a hue from 5Y to 10YR moist, value of 1 or 2 dry, 2 to 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist. Textures are very gravelly sandy loam, very cobbly loam or very gravelly fine sandy loam. Reaction is slightly to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bw2 horizon has hue of 5Y to 10YR dry or moist, value of 2 to 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist. Textures are very cobbly fine sandy loam, cobbly sandy loam, or very gravelly sandy loam. Reaction is slightly to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 5Y to 10YR dry or moist, value of 2 to 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dezellem soils are on till plains and moraines on glaciated plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent. These soils formed in glacial till mixed with loess and volcanic ash. Elevation is from 1,200 to 3,200 feet. The semiarid climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 11 to 18 inches. Average annual temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. Average January temperature is about 26 degrees F and average July temperature is about 70 degrees F. Frost-free season is 110 to 170 days."
