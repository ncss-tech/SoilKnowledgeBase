  "OVERVIEW": "The Dezellem series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess, volcanic ash and glacial till over glacial till.  Dezellem soils are on till plains, and moraines on glaciated plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and average annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Textures are gravelly ashy fine sandy loam or very stony ashy loam. Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bw1 has a hue from 5Y to 10YR moist, value of 1 or 2 dry, 2 to 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist. Textures are very gravelly sandy loam, very cobbly loam or very gravelly fine sandy loam.
