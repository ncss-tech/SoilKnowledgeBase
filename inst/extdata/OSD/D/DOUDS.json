  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Douds series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvial sediments derived from glaciers.  These soils are on risers of high stream terraces that border valleys of major streams and their tributaries.  Slope ranges from 9 to 60 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 millimeters.",
