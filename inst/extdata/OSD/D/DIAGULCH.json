  "OVERVIEW": "The Diagulch series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over slope alluvium derived from limestone and quartzite rocks.  Diagulch soils are on hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
