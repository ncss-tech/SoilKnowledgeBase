  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is more than 60 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 72 inches. Content of mica flakes is few or common throughout. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in all horizons unless the soil has been limed. Typically, the A and upper Bt horizons are moderately acid to neutral in areas that have been intensively cultivated and limed frequently. Content of water worn rock fragments by volume is 0 to 35 percent in the upper 40 inches and 0 to 60 percent below 40 inches. Rock fragments range from gravel to boulders in size.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. A thin BA horizon occurs in some pedons. It has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. It is sandy clay loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon, and the 2Bt horizon, where present, have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles, if they occur, are in shades of red, brown, or yellow. Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction. The Bt horizon contains up to 35 percent rock fragments by volume. The 2Bt horizon contains 35 to 60 percent rock fragments by volume.\nThe BC and 2BC horizons, where present, are similar in color to the Bt and 2Bt horizons. They are loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. The BC horizon contains up to 35 percent rounded rock fragments by volume. The 2BC contains 35 to 60 percent rounded rock fragments by volume.\nC or 2C horizons occur in some pedons. They are loamy or sandy alluvial or colluvial material that is variable in color. Content of felsic, intermediate and mafic igneous or high-grade metamorphic rock fragments by volume ranges up to 35 percent in the C horizon, and up to 60 percent in the 2C horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Alspaugh is the only other series in this family. It formed in alluvium and colluvium weathered from andesite and tuff and contains fragments of those rocks. It occurs on terraces at the edge of mountainous areas in Oregon. Braddock and Unison are soils in a closely related family of Typic Hapludults. Braddock soils have Bt horizons that have hue of 2.5YR or 10R. Braddock and Unison soils lack the dark color and thickness in the A horizon required for Humic Hapludults."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dillsboro soils are on gently sloping to steep high stream terraces, and on toe slopes, benches and fans in coves in the Blue Ridge (MLRA 130). Slope is commonly 2 to 15 percent, but ranges from 2 to 50 percent. Elevation ranges from about 1400 feet to 3600 feet. Dillsboro soils formed in old alluvium or colluvium derived from materials weathered from felsicto mafic rocks such as mica gneiss, granite, hornblende gneiss and hornblende schist. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 45 to 65 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Braddock, Clifton, Cowee, Dillard, Evard, Fannin, Hayesville, Hemphill  Huntdale, Saunook Statler, and Trimont soils. Braddock soils have redder subsoils and occur on convex shaped stream terraces and colluvial fans. Clifton, Cowee, Evard, Fannin, Hayesville, Huntdale, and Trimont soils are on nearby mountain ridges and side slopes and formed in residuum with some soil creep, and have C horizons in saprolite. Cowee, Evard, Fannin, Huntdale and Trimont soils are fine-loamy. Cowee soils are moderately deep to weathered bedrock and Fannin soils have micaceous mineralogy. Dillard, Hemphill, and Statler soils occur on nearby low terraces. Dillard and Statler soils are fine-loamy. In addition, Dillard soils are moderately well drained. Hemphill soils are very poorly drained.. Saunook soils are fine-loamy, formed in colluvium, and are on slopes above stream terraces."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate permeability. These soils receive surface and subsurface water from surrounding uplands especially in colluvial positions and seeps and springs are possible."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Almost all of this soil has been cleared and used for row crops such as corn, tobacco, and tomatoes, and for specialty and horticultural crops, pasture and hayland. The remainder is used for residential housing and small woodlots of Virginia pine, shortleaf pine, eastern white pine, yellow poplar, northern red oak, white oak, scarlet oak, or black locust. Understory plants include flowering dogwood, mountain laurel, rhododendron, sourwood, switchcane, and Christmas fern."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Dillsboro series was formerly included with the Braddock and Unison soils. However, Braddock and Unison soils have ochric epipedons with higher color values. In addition, Braddock soils have hue of 2.5YR or 10R in the Bt horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the surface to a depth of 10 inches (Ap horizon)\nHumic Hapludult feature - Moist value of 3 in the Ap horizon (0 to 10 inches)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 10 to 59 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and 2Bt4 horizons); CEC/100 g of clay(NH4OAC at pH 7) averages 17.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nMLRA: 130 SIR: NC0236, NC0286 (Rarely Flooded)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
