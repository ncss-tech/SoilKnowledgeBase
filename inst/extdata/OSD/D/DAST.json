  "OVERVIEW": "The Dast series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum from semiconsolidated sandy sedimentary beds.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
