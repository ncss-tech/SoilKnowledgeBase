    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 46 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 64 degrees F.  The Delson soils are noncalcareous to depths of 40 inches or more.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 50 inches or more.  Cobbles and stones range from 0 to 35 percent with the amount typically increasing with increasing depth.  The control section is usually light clay but clay ranges from 35 to 55 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 0 through 3.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe BC or C horizons have hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline."

Absarokee, Acree, Bearpaw, Danvers, Morapos, Regent, Ricot, Savage, and Work soils have a consistent k horizon.  Also, Absarokee, Broiller, and Nortez soils have a lithic contact between 20 to 40 inches.  Herm soils formed in loess over fine textured alluvium and have hue of 10YR or yellower in the lower part of the Bt horizon. Danvers, Peninsula, and Tukuhnik soils have a calcic horizon.  Regent, Reget, and Pramiss soils have a paralithic contact between depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Tamaneen soils have hue of 10YR or yellower in the Bt horizon. Tomasaki soils have an argillic horizon about 40 inches thick and clayey-skeletal material below 30 inches.  Ricot soils have a lithologic discontinuity at depths ranging from 10 to 24 inches.  Quilt soils lack stones in the particle-size control section and substratum, and have less clay in the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Delson soils are on alluvial fans, benches, and high mesas.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 65 percent.  The soils formed in noncalcareous moderately fine to fine textured alluvial fan materials derived from sedimentary and basaltic cap rock.  At the type location, the mean annual precipitation is 15 to 22 inches, with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the months of August through October.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 110 days.  Elevation ranges from 6,800 feet in the northern part of Colorado to 9,300 feet in the southern part of Colorado."

Agua Fria soils have an ochric epipedon, are calcareous in the lower part of their solum, and are mesic.  Cerro soils are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and have a higher shrink-swell ratio.  Cochetopa series are pachic and are cryic."
