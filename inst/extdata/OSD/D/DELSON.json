  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Delson series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvial material derived from sedimentary rocks and from residuum and colluvium from sandstone and shale. Delson soils are on stony outwash fans, benches, mountain and mesa side slopes. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
