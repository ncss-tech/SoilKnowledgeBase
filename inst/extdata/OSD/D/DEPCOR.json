  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to\n80 inches.  Depth to a horizon containing 5 to 25 percent\nplinthite ranges from 25 to 40 inches.  Base saturation at\n72 inches depth ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  Nodules of\nironstone range from none to few.\nThe A horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), grayish\nbrown (10YR 5/2), brown (10YR 5/3; 7.5YR 5/2), pinkish gray\n(7.5YR 6/2), or pale brown (10YR 6/3).\nThe E horizon is light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), pale\nbrown (10YR 6/3), or very pale brown (10YR 7/4).  The lower\npart of this horizon has none to few dark brown mottles.\nThe A and E horizons are loamy fine sand or loamy sand and\nrange from slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6,\nand chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles are few to common in shades\nof red and brown.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam and\nranges from medium acid to very strongly acid.  The Btv\nhorizons are mottled in shades of red (10R 4/8), light red\n(2.5YR 6/8), dark red (10R 3/6; 2.5YR 3/6), yellowish red\n(5YR 5/6, 5/8), reddish yellow (5YR 6/6, 6/8), yellowish\nbrown (10YR 5/6, 5/8), reddish brown (5YR 5/3, 5/4), strong\nbrown (7.5YR 5/8), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), light\ngray (10YR 7/1), and gray (10YR 5/1, 6/1).  They range from\nsandy clay loam to clay loam with clay content ranging from\n22 to 35 percent.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to\nvery strongly acid.\nThe C horizon ranges in base color from red, yellowish red,\nstrong brown, to brown and in many pedons is mottled in\nshades of red, yellow, gray, and brown.  It is fine sandy\nloam, sandy clay loam, or sandy clay, and is stratified in\nmany pedons.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to very\nstrongly acid."
