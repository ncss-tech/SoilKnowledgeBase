  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Dismalswamp soils are in intermountain valleys on floodplains, stream terraces and valley sides. They formed in volcanic ash and local alluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 6,080 to 8,200 feet. The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 50 inches, most of which comes as snow. The mean annual temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."

Cumulative annual duration classes are common or persistent. Some areas of these soils are susceptible to rare flooding for brief periods between December and June."
