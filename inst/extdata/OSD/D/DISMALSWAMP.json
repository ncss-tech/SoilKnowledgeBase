  "OVERVIEW": "The Dismalswamp series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and local alluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Dismalswamp soils are in intermountain valleys. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
