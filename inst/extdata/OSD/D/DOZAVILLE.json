  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of soil development is 35 to more than 80 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 23 inches in thickness and includes the BA or AB horizon, where present.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 25 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  The mean annual soil temperature is 55 to 59 degrees F. and the difference between average winter and average summer soil temperature is greater than 16 degrees F.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is silt loam.  Clay content is 18 to 27 percent, and sand content is less than 15 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a BA or AB horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture typically is silt loam, but some pedons are loam or very fine sandy loam in some thin subhorizons.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2BC, where present, and 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, very fine sand, or fine sand.  Some pedons contain color or textural strata.  Some pedons have buried soils below a depth of about 60 inches.  Carbonates, where present, occur below a depth of 40 inches.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline."

Armiesburg soils average more than 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Battleground and Omadi soils have carbonates throughout the series control section or at depths of less than 10 inches from the soil surface.  Bismarckgrove soils have mean annual soil temperature of less than 55 degress F. and have redox concentrations at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Dungan (T) soils have a difference between average winter and average summer soil temperature of less than 16 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dozaville soils are on flood plains.  They formed dominantly in silty alluvium that becomes sandy with increasing depth below the particle-size control section.  Slopes commonly are 0 to 2 percent but range to as steep as 5 percent.  These soils typically are subject to frequent flooding, but flooding frequency in some areas is occasional or rare because of levees, locks and dams, or other flood-control structures.  Mean annual temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 36 to 44 inches, frost-free period is 170 to 210 days, and elevation is 350 to 550 feet above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Blake, Ceresco, Coffeen, Nameoki and Wakeland soils are on lower lying, nearly level flood plains.  The moderately well drained Haynie soils and the well drained Haymond soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are on slightly lower or similar parts of the landform nearby.  The well drained Landes and Rocher soils are on higher natural levees nearby.  Rocher soils do not have a mollic epipedon."
