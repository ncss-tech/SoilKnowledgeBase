  "OVERVIEW": "The Denham series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy eolian deposits on outwash plains, glacial lake plains, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
