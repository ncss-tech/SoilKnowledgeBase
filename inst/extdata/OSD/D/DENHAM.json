Factoryville soils have a solum less than 102 cm (40 inches) in thickness. Platteriver soils average less than 50 percent fine sand in the particle-size control section. Solo soils are in areas that receive more than 1067 mm (42 inches) of mean annual precipitation."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days.
