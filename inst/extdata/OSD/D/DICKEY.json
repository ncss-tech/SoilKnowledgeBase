  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the loamy material commonly is 24 to 36 inches but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is less than 16 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1.  It has chroma of 2 in the lower part of some pedons.  It typically is loamy fine sand or loamy sand but some is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5 and 3 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loamy fine sand, fine sand, or loamy sand.  It has weak grades of prismatic or subangular blocky structure. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have AC, BC, or C horizons above the 2C material.  Some pedons have 2BC horizons.\nThe 2Bk and 2C horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They typically are loam or clay loam glacial till but some are silt loam or silty clay loam lacustrine sediments.  They contain up to 10 percent by volume of rock fragments.  They are slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.  The 2Bk horizon contains an estimated 10 to 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, but has more than 15 percent in some part.  A thin stone, cobble or gravel line is at the upper boundary of the 2Bk horizon in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Dickey soils are on level to hilly sand mantled till or glaciolacustrine plains.  Slopes are convex or plain and range from 0 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in wind and water deposited sands over loam or clay loam till or lacustrine sediments.  The climate is cool, subhumid.  Mean annual air temperatures range from 36 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 15 to 23 inches.  Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer."

Towner and Swenoda soils are on nearby less sloping areas.  Swenoda soils are coarse-loamy.  Barnes, Buse, Esmond, Emrick and Heimdal soils are on nearby upland till plains.  All are loamy throughout.  Egeland soils are on nearby outwash plains and are coarse-loamy.  Hecla and Maddock soils are on nearby delta and lacustrine areas where sands are thicker.  They are sandy.  Serden soils are on hilly sandy areas.  They do not have mollic epipedons."
