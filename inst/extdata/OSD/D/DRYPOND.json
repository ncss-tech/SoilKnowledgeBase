  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 10 to 18 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Sandstone and quartzite gravel, channers, and cobbles range from 15 to 75 percent in the A horizon, from 25 to 80 percent in the Bw horizon, and from 45 to 90 percent in the C horizon.  Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is sandy loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no known series in this family.  Soils in similar families are Wallen, Dekalb, Ramsey, Lily, and Jefferson. Wallen and Dekalb soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.  Ramsey soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the textural control section.  Lily soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock and have argillic horizons.  Jefferson soils are more than 60 inches to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They are on gently sloping ridgetops and very steep convex sideslopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 80 percent.  The climate is temperate and humid.  The mean air temperature ranges from 53 to 56 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 45 inches."

Cataska, Dekalb, Lily, Sylco and Wallen soils are deeper to bedrock and occur on similar landscape positions.  Jefferson, Matneflat and Tumbling soils are deeper to bedrock and occur on colluvial fans and footslopes.  Sylvatus soils contain more silt and occur on similar landscape positions."
