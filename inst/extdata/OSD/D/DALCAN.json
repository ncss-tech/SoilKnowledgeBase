  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 40 to 47 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F.  The soil temperature regime is frigid.  The soil is usually moist during the period the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  The soil is moist in some part of the moisture control section for 35 to 50 days during the summer months, and dry for 60 to 75 days during the 120 days following the winter solstice.  The soil moisture regime is ustic.\nThe mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 28 inches thick.  Thickness of solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The soil is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  Rock fragment content in the particle size control section averages 35 to 70 percent.  Clay content in the control section averages 35 to 50 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and 1 or 2 moist.  It contains 15 to 60 percent rock fragments.\nThe BAt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture of the fine earth is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam or clay with 10 to 45 percent rock fragments.\nThe Bt (argillic) horizon typically has hue of 7.5YR and less commonly 5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is gravelly clay, extremely gravelly clay, very gravelly clay, very cobbly clay, very cobbly or extremely cobbly clay loam, very gravelly or extremely gravelly clay loam.  It contains 25 to 70 percent rock fragments.  Some pedons have extremely cobbly or extremely gravelly C horizons."

These soils formed in residuum colluvium and alluvium weathered from basalt and intermediate igneous rocks.  The mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature is 62 to 66 degrees F.  The mean average annual precipitation is 14 to 22 inches and freeze-free period is 60 to 110 days."
