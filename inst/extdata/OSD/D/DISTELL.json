    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Diagnostic remnants of argillic horizons range from few to common and from fine to coarse in size and make up 3 to about 15 percent by volume.  These are randomly oriented.  Colors range as shown in the typifying pedon.  Reaction before liming mostly includes very strongly acid through medium acid but may be slightly acid in some horizons.  Composite texture throughout is dominantly sandy clay loam but mixed textures include fine sandy loam, clay loam and clay.  Fragments of randomly oriented lignite are common in most pedons.  These soils are mostly sticky and plastic when wet and hard or very hard when dry."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series within this family.  The tentative Diswood series has similar profile characteristics but is a member of a fine particle size family and is dry for shorter periods of time during most years.  The tentative Thermo series is dry for shorter periods of time in most years, has a fine particle-size class, is more layered due to scraper placement, and appears to be more dense and compact due to apparent traffic pan formation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Distell soils are on gently sloping to steep slopes.  They apparently occur under dragline operations where lignite lies immediately or slightly below the oxidized materials, or in box cut areas where oxidized material is placed on the surface.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 64 to 70 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from about 32 to 42 inches.  P-E indices range from 52 to 64."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Most minesoils are placed in Orthents.  Because of remnants of diagnostic horizons in these soils, they qualify as Arents.\nThese soils have an ustic moisture regime. At the present time there are no subgroups recognized for the Ustarents. A proposal is being made to provide for Alfic Ustarents and this soil will be classified as such once the proposal is approved.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 8 inches.\nFragments of diagnostic horizons - 8 to 47 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
