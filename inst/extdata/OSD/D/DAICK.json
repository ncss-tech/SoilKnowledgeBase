  "OVERVIEW": "The Daick series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from tuffaceous sedimentary rocks.  Daick soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
