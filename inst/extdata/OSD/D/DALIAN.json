  "OVERVIEW": "The Dalian series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly sediments derived primarily from limestone and calcareous sandstone on alluvial fans and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.",

The soils formed in gravelly sediments derived primarily or wholly from high carbonate rocks such as limestone and calcareous sandstone; in places, there are minor admixtures of such rocks as rhyolite, andesite, monzonite, or granite.  Elevations range from 2,200 to 4,500 feet.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 4 to 11 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 57 degrees to 70 degrees F."

Headquarters soils have argillic horizons.  Reakor soils are nongravelly and have calcic horizons.  Caliza and Weiser soils have calcic horizons."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)\nEntisol feature - The absence of diagnostic subsurface horizons\nThis series represents an identified soil within the Desert Soil-Geomorphology Project, Las Cruces, New Mexico.  The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.\nWhen the competing series section was updated in September 2001, questions were raised about the description and/or the classification of this series. It was suggested that this soil should classify in the great group of Haplocambids or Haplocalcids. A field study of the type location is recommended to resolve the questions."
