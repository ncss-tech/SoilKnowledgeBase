  "OVERVIEW": "The Decolney series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or eolian deposits derived from sedimentary beds.  Decolney soils are on stabilized dune topography on uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

It is assumed the Gaddes and Yenlo are competing pending an update of the classification.  Balon series has a MAST of 56 degrees F. or warmer.  Blancot, Cambria, Doakum, Forkwood, Los Alamos, Mentmore, Oelop, Olney, Penistaja, Potts, Spenlo, Sundance, Teckla and Yenlo series have either Bk or Ck horizons or carbonates above 40 inches.  Bowbac, Cerrillos, Cushman, Gaddes, Gapmesa, Hagerman, Hagerwest, Pokeman, Pugsley and Spangler soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Buckle and Palacid soils have a Bt with depths greater than 30 inches.  Cambria soils have Bt horizons whose base is less than 10 inches.  Quagwa soils have annual soil temperatures of 54 to 57 degrees F and are driest during May and June.  Redpen soils have 2.5YR hue.  Teckla soils have discontinuities with more than 35 percent rock fragments between 15 and 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Decolney soils are on stabilized dune topography including alluvial fans, fan remnants, pediments, terraces, plateaus, ridges and hills.  They formed in eolian or alluvium deposits derived from mixed sedimentary bedrock. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  Elevations range from 3,500 to 5,200 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches, about half of which falls as rain or snow from late March through June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free period is estimated to range from 105 to 130 days."
