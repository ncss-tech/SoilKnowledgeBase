The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The soil is usually dry at a depth of 20 inches when the temperature is 41 degrees F. The moisture control section is dry for at least 60 consecutive days and 90 cumulative days between July 15 and October 25. The soil temperature is 41 degrees F. or greater for 175 to 192 days.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.

It is assumed the Gaddes and Yenlo are competing pending an update of the classification.  Balon series has a MAST of 56 degrees F. or warmer.  Blancot, Cambria, Doakum, Forkwood, Los Alamos, Mentmore, Oelop, Olney, Penistaja, Potts, Spenlo, Sundance, Teckla and Yenlo series have either Bk or Ck horizons or carbonates above 40 inches.  Bowbac, Cerrillos, Cushman, Gaddes, Gapmesa, Hagerman, Hagerwest, Pokeman, Pugsley and Spangler soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Buckle and Palacid soils have a Bt with depths greater than 30 inches.  Cambria soils have Bt horizons whose base is less than 10 inches.  Quagwa soils have annual soil temperatures of 54 to 57 degrees F and are driest during May and June.  Redpen soils have 2.5YR hue.  Teckla soils have discontinuities with more than 35 percent rock fragments between 15 and 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Decolney soils are on stabilized dune topography including alluvial fans, fan remnants, pediments, terraces, plateaus, ridges and hills.  They formed in eolian or alluvium deposits derived from mixed sedimentary bedrock. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  Elevations range from 3,500 to 5,200 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches, about half of which falls as rain or snow from late March through June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free period is estimated to range from 105 to 130 days."
