  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Badus, Calco, Lamo, Obert, Salmo, Sawabash and Wingville series.\nBadus soils have Bw horizons and accumulations of carbonates and gypsum.  Calco soils commonly have snail shells throughout their solum, have dark colored A horizons with values of 3 dry and Bg horizons.  Lamo soils commonly lack iron masses in the A horizon, have accumulations of calcium carbonate below 58 cm, and a calcium carbonate equivalent of 1 to 15 percent.  Obert and Sawabash soils are moist in the moisture control section during summer months.  Salmo soils have accumulations of salt and gypsum in their B and C horizons.  Wingville soils have an AC horizon and have C horizons high in volcanic ash."
