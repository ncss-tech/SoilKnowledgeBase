  "OVERVIEW": "The Devilsgait series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with deposits of loess and volcanic ash.  Devilsgait soils are on flood plains and lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.   The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",

Lamo soils commonly lack iron masses in the A horizon, have accumulations of calcium carbonate below 58 cm, and a calcium carbonate equivalent of 1 to 15 percent.  Obert and Sawabash soils are moist in the moisture control section during summer months.  Salmo soils have accumulations of salt and gypsum in their B and C horizons.  Wingville soils have an AC horizon and have C horizons high in volcanic ash."
