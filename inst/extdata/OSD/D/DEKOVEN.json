    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 48 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 3 or less.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have an overwash of 6 to 15 inches thick with 10YR hue, value of 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, 5GY, 5G or N; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 2 or less, with mottles in shades of brown or yellow.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Some horizons have buried horizons.\nWhen present some pedons have Ab, Bgb, or BCb horizons.  The Ab horizon has bue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Bgb and BCb horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma 1 or 2.  Mottles are in shades of olive, brown, or gray.  Texture for these horizons is silt loam or silty clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing soils in the same family.  Soils in similar families are the Lanton, Roellen, and Egam series. The Lanton series has a thicker (24 inches or more) mollic epipedon. The Roellen is fine textured.  The Egam series also is fine textured and better drained, with dominant chromas of 2 or more to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in alluvial material derived from loess.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 65 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 55 inches."
