  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic or lithic contact is 40 to 60 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 50 degrees to 56 degrees F. and the soil temperature is usually not below 47 degrees F.  The difference between mean winter and mean summer temperature is 5 degrees to 8 degrees F. The soil moisture control section is moist in all parts for about 290 to 300 days. Reaction is slightly acid to strongly acid with acidity increasing with increasing depth. Base saturation is less than 50 percent in some part of the A horizon but ranges from 35 to 60 percent (ammonium acetate). In the lower part of the B horizon the base saturation ranges from 55 to 70 percent but is more than 60 percent at the paralithic contact. Rock fragments are present in all horizons and average 15 to 80 percent. The control section is 25 to 70 percent.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 3/2, 4/2, 4/4, 5/2, 5/4; 5YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4 or 10YR 5/3 and moist color of 5YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3, 3/4; 7.5YR 3/2, 4/2 or 4/4. It is gravelly loam, or very gravelly loam and has 15 to 55 percent rock fragments.\nThe B2t horizon has dry color of 5YR 4/3, 4/4, 4/6, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 5/8, 6/4, 6/6, 6/8, 7/6, 7/8; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4 or 6/4 and moist color of 5YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4; 7.5YR 4/2 or 4/4. It is very gravelly heavy loam, very gravelly sandy clay loam, or very gravelly clay loam.\nSome pedons have a C horizon above the paralithic contact."
