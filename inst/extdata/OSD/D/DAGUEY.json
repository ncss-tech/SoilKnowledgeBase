Catlon exchange capacity ranges from 8 to 16 meq/100 grams of clay in the kandic horizon.  The organic carbon content in the upper 6 inches of the kandic horizon ranges from 1.0 to 1.6.\nThe Bo horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 4 to 5 and chroma of 6 through 8.  Yellowish brown mottles are few or common and are more evident in the upper B horizons."

The soil is formed in fine textured residuum from very highly weathered basic volcanic rocks.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 70 to 85 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 74 to 76 degrees F."
