  "OVERVIEW": "The Daguey series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on sideslopes, ridgetops and footslopes in volcanic uplands. They formed in fine textured residuum weathered from volcanic rock. Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 85 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 76 degrees F.",
