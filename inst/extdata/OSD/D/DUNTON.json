  "OVERVIEW": "The Dunton series consists of moderately deep well drained soils formed in materials weathered from sandstone.  Dunton soils are on mesa tops and cuesta dip slopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 640 mm.  Typically, Dunton soils have pinkish gray friable granular A2 horizons, transitional A&B horizons, and brown heavy clay loam B2t horizons that have subangular blocky structure.  Sandstone bedrock occurs at a depth of about 99 cm.",
