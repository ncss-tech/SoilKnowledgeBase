  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thin A1 horizons up to 3 inches thick are present in some pedons.  Depth to the argillic horizon ranges from 24 to 30 inches.  Depth to sandstone bedrock ranges from 30 to 40 inches.  The solum ranges from medium acid to neutral.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent in the major part of the solum and any C horizon, and are predominately 5 to 15 inches in diameter.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 to 46 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F.\nThe A1 horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is usually heavy clay loam or clay with clay ranging from 35 to 50 percent.  A thin C horizon is present in some pedons."

The soils formed in materials weathered from sandstone.  Elevation ranges from 7,500 to 10,000 feet.  Precipitation ranges from 20 to 30 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature is 54 degrees F."
