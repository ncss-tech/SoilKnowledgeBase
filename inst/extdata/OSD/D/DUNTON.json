  "OVERVIEW": "The Dunton series consists of moderately well drained soils formed in materials weathered from sandstone.  Dunton soils are on mesa tops and cuesta dip slopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches.  Typically, Dunton soils have pinkish gray friable granular A2 horizons, transitional A&B horizons, and brown heavy clay loam B2t horizons that have subangular blocky structure.  Sandstone bedrock occurs at a depth of about 38 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thin A1 horizons up to 3 inches thick are present in some pedons.  Depth to the argillic horizon ranges from 24 to 30 inches.  Depth to sandstone bedrock ranges from 30 to 40 inches.  The solum ranges from medium acid to neutral.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent in the major part of the solum and any C horizon, and are predominately 5 to 15 inches in diameter.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 to 46 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F.\nThe A1 horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is usually heavy clay loam or clay with clay ranging from 35 to 50 percent.  A thin C horizon is present in some pedons."
