The soil is dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is loamy sand, fine sand, or medium sand.  This horizon has subangular blocky or granular structure.  It is neutral to moderately acid.\nThe E&B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 6.  This horizon above 40 inches is fine sand, sand, or loamy sand.  Below 40 inches, this horizon ranges to gravelly sand or gravelly loamy sand.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  Total thickness of lamellae is less than 6 inches."

Dick soils are in a mild marine climate and have cool dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean January temperature is about 39 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 17 to 25 inches.  Frost-free season is 160 to 200 days."
