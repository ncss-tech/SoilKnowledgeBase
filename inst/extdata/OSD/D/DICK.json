The soil is dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is loamy sand, fine sand, or medium sand.  This horizon has subangular blocky or granular structure.  It is neutral to moderately acid.\nThe E&B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 6.  This horizon above 40 inches is fine sand, sand, or loamy sand.  Below 40 inches, this horizon ranges to gravelly sand or gravelly loamy sand.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  Total thickness of lamellae is less than 6 inches."
