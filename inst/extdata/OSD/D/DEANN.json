  "OVERVIEW": "The Deann series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, clayey soils which formed in  clayey marine sediments overlying chalk and/or marl.  These soils are on level to gently rolling  broad interfluves, with slopes of 0 to 8 percent slopes in MLRA 135B Cretaceous Western Coastal Plain.  Mean annual tempertature is 60 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 48 inches.",

Common or many intersecting slickensides are in the AC and C horizons. These are cyclic soils, with cycles of microknolls and microbasins repeated\nat linear intervals of 6 to 12 feet. The amplitude of waviness of the boundary between the A and AC horizon ranges from about 9 to 26 inches. The A horizon ranges from slightly acid through mildly alkaline.
