Common or many intersecting slickensides are in the AC and C horizons. These are cyclic soils, with cycles of microknolls and microbasins repeated\nat linear intervals of 6 to 12 feet. The amplitude of waviness of the boundary between the A and AC horizon ranges from about 9 to 26 inches. The A horizon ranges from slightly acid through mildly alkaline. Few, common,or many calcium carbonate concretions occur in the Bss and C horizons.\nAp or A horizon\nHue:  10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y\nValue:  2 or 3\nchroma:  1 or 2\nTexture: clay\nReaction: slightly acid through moderately alkaline\nBssk horizon\nHue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y\nValue of 4 or 5\nChroma of 2 or 3\nTexture:  clay\nReaction: slightly acid through moderately alkaline\nC horizon, when present\nHue:  10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y\nValue:  4 or 5\nChroma: 3 through 6.\nTexture: clay\nRedoximorphic features: shades of brown, yellow or gray\nReaction:  neutral to moderately alkaline\nChalk bedrock is commonly light gray or pale yellow in color"
