  "OVERVIEW": "The Droem series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum from andesite, latite, and basalt.  Droem soils are on southern aspects of mountainsides and have slopes of 8 to 40 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Average annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 45 to 90 days.",
