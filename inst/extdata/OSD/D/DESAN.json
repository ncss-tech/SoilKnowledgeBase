Catilla, Navasan, Padina, and Patilo soils have mottled Bt horizons.  Matilo soils have a paralithic contact between 60 and 80 inches.  Eufaula soils have sandy control sections and Bt horizons that consists of lamellae.  Heaton and Nimrod soils are in arenic subgroups.  In addition, Nimrod soils have mottles associated with wetness.  Sarita soils are in the hyperthermic family.  Silvern soils are in the loamy-skeletal family."
