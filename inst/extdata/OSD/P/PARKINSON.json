  "OVERVIEW": "The Parkinson series consist of medial Calcisola in the Brown soils zone, formed in old, medium-textured alluvium containing abundant quartzite pebbles and cobbles.  The alluvium is derived principally from quartzite sources.  This series has an A, AC, Cca, and D horizon sequence.  The A, horizon is grayish brown (10YR 5/2) (dry), is at least 1 value darker than the C horizon, and contains about 1:2 to 2.5 percent of organic matter.  This series has a strong ca horizon, which occurs at about 12 inches.  In most places, this series is calcareous throughout.\nThis series may be associated with the Beaver Creek, Medicine lodge, Peterson, and Utley series.  It differs from the Beaver Creek series in being calcareous throughout and in having a strong ca horizon.  The Peterson and Utley series are shallow (less than 24 or 22 inches deep) over gravel and sand.  The Medicine Lodge series is calcareous throughout but has a lighter colored A1 horizon (lighter than 5.5 value when dry).  The Bannock series is formed in more mixed alluvium derived from more varied sources.\nThe Parkinson series occurs at elevations of 4,500 to 6,500 feet in a semiarid continental climate.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer air temperature ranges from 62 to 56 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 94 to 125 days.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 11 to 13 inches and is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year except for May and June, which are slightly higher.  The area receives about 3 to 5 feet of snowfall.  The series covers about 5 square miles and is slightly important agriculturally",
