  "OVERVIEW": "The Potchub series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in glacial till and volcanic ash on glacially modified mountain slopes and plateaus.  Slopes are 3 to 90 percent. The average annual precipitation ranges from 80 to 100 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

It is extremely acid or very strongly acid.  Some pedons lack an A horizon.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 7 moist, 5 through 8 dry, and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and dry.  Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Bhs and Bs horizons have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.

The soils formed in glacial till and volcanic ash.  The till has mixed lithology.  Potchub soils are in a cool marine climate with cool, dry summers, and cold, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 80 to 100 inches.  The average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 100 days."

This pedon reflects a change in classification from coarse-loamy, mixed Humic Cryorthods to Medial Aquandic Humicryods.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an albic horizon from 7 to 10 inches, a spodic horizon from 10 to 34 inches with more than 6 percent organic carbon in the upper 4 inches, and a paralithic contact at 34 inches with dense glacial till.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
