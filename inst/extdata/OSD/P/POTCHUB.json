Depth to the paralithic contact with dense glacial till and thickness of volcanic ash influence ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 0 to 35 percent hard and 0 to 15 percent weathered rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is extremely acid or very strongly acid.  Some pedons lack an A horizon.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 7 moist, 5 through 8 dry, and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and dry.  Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Bhs and Bs horizons have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Potchub soils are on glacially modified mountain backslopes and plateaus at elevations of 2,600 to 3,600 feet.  Slope is 3 to 90 percent.  The soils formed in glacial till and volcanic ash.  The till has mixed lithology.  Potchub soils are in a cool marine climate with cool, dry summers, and cold, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 80 to 100 inches.  The average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 100 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Except for the change from Cr to Cd, classification only updated 3/94 because of recent amendments to Soil Taxonomy. This pedon reflects a change in classification from coarse-loamy, mixed Humic Cryorthods to Medial Aquandic Humicryods.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an albic horizon from 7 to 10 inches, a spodic horizon from 10 to 34 inches with more than 6 percent organic carbon in the upper 4 inches, and a paralithic contact at 34 inches with dense glacial till.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
