  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 60 to more than 80 inches.   The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick. Secondary carbonates occur below 36 inches.\nThe A horizon has colors in hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR with value of 3 and 4, and chroma of 2 and 3.  It is medium acid through mildly alkaline.  It is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt1 and Bt2 horizons have colors in hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, and 5YR, with value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 4.  They contain few to many, faint to prominent reddish, brownish, yellowish, or grayish mottles.  These horizons are sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay with the upper part being the most clayey.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon ranges from 23 to 35 percent clay.  These horizons are slightly acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt3 horizon has colors in hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR, and 2.5YR with value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  They are sandy clay loam or clay loam with 0 to 10 percent visible concretions and soft bodies of calcium carbonate. They are mildly through moderately alkaline.\nThe BCk horizon has colors with value and chroma that are 1 or 2 units higher than the horizons above.  Pedons with chroma of 4 or less have common coarse mottles with chroma of 6 or 8.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or fine sandy loam with 0 to 10 percent visible concretions and soft masses of calcium carbonate and a few dark brown concretions.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family. Series in similar families include the Amphion, Bethany, Darrouzett, Dina, Hanis, Hollister, Liv, Matfield, and Rotan series.  Amphion and Hanis soils have thinner surfaces.  Bethany, Darrouzett, Hollister, and Rotan soils have a mean annual soil temperature less than 72 degrees F. Dina, Liv, and Matfield soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Poteet soils occupy nearly level, slightly concave positions in weakly depressed drainageways and nearly level low terraces.   Slopes are less than 2 percent.  The soil formed in clayey and loamy sediments. Occasional to frequent flooding occurs.  Occasionally flooded areas receive damaging floodwaters about once every 4 or 5 years, but receive some runoff, mostly beneficial to crop growth, after every rainstorm.   Frequently flooded areas receive damaging floodwaters at least once every two years.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 30 inches and mean annual air temperature ranges from 69 to 72 degrees F.  Frost-free days range from 240 to 280 days and elevation ranges from 400 to 800 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 24 to 40."

Amphion and Hanis soils are on adjoining plains and have finer textured A horizons. Miguel, Opelika, and Papalote soils have thinner surfaces and in addition Miguel and Papalote soils do not receive outside water.  Wilco soils lack mollic colors, have sandy epipedons less than 20 inches thick and do not receive outside water."

In excellent condition, the native vegetation is predominantly mid grasses with a few liveoak and hackberry trees, and with scattered shrubs, a few short grasses and about 5 percent perennial forbs.  With retrogression typical increasers and invaders are mesquite, spiny hackberry, pricklypear, hooded windmillgrass, threeawn, Halls panicum, red lovegrass, fringed signalgrass, grassbur, and annual forbs."
