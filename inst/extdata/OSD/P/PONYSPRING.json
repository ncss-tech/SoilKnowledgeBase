  "OVERVIEW": "The Ponyspring series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff. The Ponyspring soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
