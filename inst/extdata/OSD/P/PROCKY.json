  "OVERVIEW": "The Procky series consists of moderately deep or deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from basalt. Procky soils are on bases of hillslopes. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
