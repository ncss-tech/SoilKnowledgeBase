They formed in eolian deposits over alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist; and Quaternary loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 1 to 4 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,100 to 8,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 160 days."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 4 inches. (A and BA horizons)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 4 to about 19 inches. (Bt, Btk1, and Btk2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 19 to about 36 inches. (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 4 to 19 inches (Bt, Btk1, and Btk2 horizons)\nSeries control section - The zone from 0 to 60 inches.\nPaleustalf great group - The upper part of the argillic horizon has 35 to 42 percent clay, and a clay increase of 15 percent or more (absolute) within one inch at its upper boundary. (BA and Bt horizons)\nNote:  This soil has minor amounts of volcanic glass in the coarse silt and very fine sand fractions.  It is assumed that most of the volcanic glass derived from nearby Pleistocene ash eruptions has altered to more stable minerals like chalcedony.  In addition, Lincoln lab data from adjacent soils indicates that ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum and iron percentages are very low.  It is estimated that Predawn soils have similar values and thus do not have the properties of the andic intergrades.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
