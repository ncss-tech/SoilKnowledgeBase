  "OVERVIEW": "The Predawn series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, schist, loess, and volcanic ash.  Predawn soils are on summits of eroded fan remnants.  Slopes are 1 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

(A and BA horizons)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 4 to about 19 inches. (Bt, Btk1, and Btk2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 19 to about 36 inches. (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 4 to 19 inches (Bt, Btk1, and Btk2 horizons)\nSeries control section - The zone from 0 to 60 inches.\nPaleustalf great group - The upper part of the argillic horizon has 35 to 42 percent clay, and a clay increase of 15 percent or more (absolute) within one inch at its upper boundary. (BA and Bt horizons)\nNote:  This soil has minor amounts of volcanic glass in the coarse silt and very fine sand fractions.  It is assumed that most of the volcanic glass derived from nearby Pleistocene ash eruptions has altered to more stable minerals like chalcedony.  In addition, Lincoln lab data from adjacent soils indicates that ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum and iron percentages are very low.  It is estimated that Predawn soils have similar values and thus do not have the properties of the andic intergrades.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
