  "OVERVIEW": "The Philmont series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fine textured alluvium and residuum derived from Cretaceous-aged shale. Philmont soils are on interfluves of plateaus or fan remnant toeslopes and have slopes of 0 to 6 percent. The mean annual precip. is about 16 inches and mean annual soil temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 80 inches. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 20 inches thick. Depth to the argillic horizon ranges from 2 to 10 inches. Depth to pedogenic lime ranges from 10 to 20 inches. The soil temperature regime is mesic, and the moisture regime is aridic-ustic.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam, loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. The textures range from silty clay, clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam and has 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5. The textures range from silty clay, clay, silty clay loam or clay loam and has 35 to 50 percent clay. The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 1 to 10 percent.\nWhere a Bk or BCk horizon exists, it has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and a chroma of 3 through 5. The textures range from loam, clay loam, silty clay, or silty clay loam and has 22 to 40 percent clay.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 1 to 10 percent.\nOther features: Some profiles, where a history of heavy grazing, plowing, or other heavy utilization has taken place, will have an eroded version of the A horizon. In these cases, the Bt or Btk horizon may be close to or at the surface, and the soil will not meet criteria for mollic epipedons. The surface textures will not likely be a loam or silt loam, but something higher in clay. Some profiles have a C or Cr horizon where weathered shale material is encountered or influences the profile somewhere below 40 inches. Few to no fragments are found in this profile."
