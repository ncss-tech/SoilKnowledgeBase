  "REVDATE": "09/2012",
  "STATES": "IN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinhook series consists of deep, poorly drained, moderately rapid permeable soils formed in loamy glacial outwash low in carbonates.  These terrace soils have slopes ranging from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F, and precipitation is about 35 inches.",

Except for A horizons that have been limed, sola is commonly very strongly acid or strongly acid and less commonly medium acid.  Coarse fragments range from 2 to 25 percent throughout the solum.\nThe Al or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or sandy loam.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5YR, or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or less.  It is loam or sandy loam.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5YR, or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or less.  Mottles range from few to many, fine to coarse, and faint to prominent.  It is commonly loam or sandy loam.  Individual horizons in some pedons are loamy sand, sandy clay loam, gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam, gravelly loamy sand or gravelly sandy clay loam.  It has weak to moderate, medium to coarse subangular blocky structure or weak to moderate, medium to coarse prismatic that parts to subangular blocky.  The B2t has friable or firm consistency.\nThe IIC horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5YR, or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 6.

These soils formed in the same kind of material as Pinhook and lack the dark colored surface layer.  Hanna and Quinn soils are on nearly level slopes, and Tracy soils are on level to moderately steep slopes."
