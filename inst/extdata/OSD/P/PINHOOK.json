  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness typically is 40 to 56 inches.  Except for A horizons that have been limed, sola is commonly very strongly acid or strongly acid and less commonly medium acid.  Coarse fragments range from 2 to 25 percent throughout the solum.\nThe Al or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or sandy loam.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5YR, or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or less.  It is loam or sandy loam.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5YR, or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or less.  Mottles range from few to many, fine to coarse, and faint to prominent.  It is commonly loam or sandy loam.  Individual horizons in some pedons are loamy sand, sandy clay loam, gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam, gravelly loamy sand or gravelly sandy clay loam.  It has weak to moderate, medium to coarse subangular blocky structure or weak to moderate, medium to coarse prismatic that parts to subangular blocky.  The B2t has friable or firm consistency.\nThe IIC horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5YR, or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 6.  It is stratified loamy sand, sand, gravelly sand, and gravelly loamy sand.  Individual horizons have less than 1 percent to 30 percent coarse fragments."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Competing series is closely related families are Quinn, Morocco, and Tedrow.  Quinn soils have surface colors of higher value when the surface 6 inches are mixed.  Morocco and Tedrow soils lack argillic horizons and contain more sand in the sola."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pinhook soils are on terraces.  Slopes are commonly 2 percent or less.  Pinhook soils formed in glacial outwash that is moderately high in sand and shale and low in carbonates.  Summers are hot and winters are cold.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 55 degrees F, and annual average precipitation ranges from 30 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  The Pinhook soils are closely associated with the moderately well drained Hanna, well drained Tracy, and poorly drained Quinn soils.  These soils formed in the same kind of material as Pinhook and lack the dark colored surface layer.  Hanna and Quinn soils are on nearly level slopes, and Tracy soils are on level to moderately steep slopes."
