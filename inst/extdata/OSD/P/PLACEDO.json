  "STATES": "LA,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Placedo series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable, ponded soils that have formed in saline, alkaline, clayey alluvium near sea level. These nearly level soils occur on flood plains. Slope ranges from  0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F).",
