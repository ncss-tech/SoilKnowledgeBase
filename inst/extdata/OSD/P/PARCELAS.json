  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Parcelas series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on foot slopes, alluvial fans, and terraces.  They formed in fine textured sediments that weathered from plutonic rock.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 85 inches.  Slopes range from 5 to 12 percent.",

Mayo soils are on similar to slightly lower positions and have coarse-loamy control sections.  Pandura and Teja soils are shallow to bedrock and are on higher adjacent positions.
