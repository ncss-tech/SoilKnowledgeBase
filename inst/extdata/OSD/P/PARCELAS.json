Mayo soils are on similar to slightly lower positions and have coarse-loamy control sections.  Pandura and Teja soils are shallow to bedrock and are on higher adjacent positions.  In addition, Pandura soils are fine-loamy and Teja soils are loamy-skeletal.  Patillas soils are on higher adjacent positions and have fine-loamy control sections."
