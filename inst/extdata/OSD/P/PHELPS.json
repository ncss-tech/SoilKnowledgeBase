  "STATES": "NY,PA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Phelps series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in glacial outwash. They are nearly level and gently sloping soils formed in loamy material overlying calcareous, stratified gravel and sand. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the mineral solum and high or very high in the sand and gravel. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 40 inches corresponding to the depth to the underlying sand and gravel. Depths to carbonates ranges from 18 to 72 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Coarse fragments, dominantly gravel and cobble stones, range from 5 to 35 percent in the solum and 35 to 70 percent in the 2C horizon and includes 0 to 15 percent cobblestones in the solum and 0 to 20 percent in the 2C horizon. Some subhorizons of the 2C horizon may contain as few as 5 percent rock fragments. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the Ap and argillic horizons, slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the BC horizon, and slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the 2C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sandy loam to silt loam in the fine earth fraction. It has moderate, fine or medium granular structure and friable or very friable consistence. Thin remnants of E horizons are in some pedons.\nThe Bt/E horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 or 3 in the E part and hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4 in the Bt part and they may have both high and low chroma redoximorphic features. It is loam, silt loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction. It has weak or moderate, subangular blocky, or granular structure.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It has redoximorphic depletions and concentrations. Depletions occur in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon. It is loam, silt loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction. It has moderate, medium or coarse subangular blocky structure. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe BC horizon, when present, has a color range similar to the Bt. Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam and sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. It has weak or moderate, medium or coarse subangular blocky or platy structure. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is sand or loamy sand in the fine earth fraction or is stratified gravel and sand."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Phelps is the only series in this family.\nFredon, Howard, Kars, Palmyra, and Wampsville are closely related soils in similar families. Fredon soils lack argillic horizons and have aquic moisture regimes. Howard and Kars soils are loamy-skeletal and lack redoximorphic features in the argillic horizon. Palmyra lacks redoximorphic depletions in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Wampsville soils are fine-loamy and lack redoximorphic features in the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Phelps soils occupy nearly level to gently sloping or slightly depressed parts of glacial outwash terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. The regolith is mainly gravelly glacial outwash, mantled by two or three feet of silty or loamy material in most places. The climate is humid and cool-temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches, mean annual air temperature from 45 degrees F, and mean growing season from 130 to 200 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The Phelps soils are in a drainage sequence with the well drained Delaware, Palmyra, Howard, and Wampsville soils, the somewhat poorly drained Red Hook soils, the somewhat poorly drained or poorly drained Fredon soils, and the very poorly drained Halsey soils. Also associated are the Arkport, Cazenovia, Collamer, Cosad, Dunkirk, Honeoye, Hudson, Lansing, Ontario, Rhinebeck, and Varysburg soils. Arkport soils formed in deep well drained sandy deltaic deposits. Cazenovia, Honeoye, Lansing and Ontario soils are on nearby upland till plains. Collamer and Dunkirk soils are on silty lacustrine deposits. Cosad soils formed in sandy deltaic deposits that overlie clayey lacustrine deposits. Hudson and Rhinebeck soils formed in clayey lacustrine deposits. Varysburg soils formed in similar outwash materials that overlie clayey lacustrine deposits."
