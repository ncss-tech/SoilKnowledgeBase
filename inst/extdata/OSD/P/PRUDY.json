  "OVERVIEW": "The Prudy series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in\nmixed colluvium over calcareous quartzite residuum.  Prudy soils are on\nmountainsides and have slopes of 30 to 60 percent.  Permeability is\nmoderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the\naverage annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
