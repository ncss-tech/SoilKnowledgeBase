  "OVERVIEW": "The Paranat series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvial derived from mixed rocks.  Paranat soils are on axial stream flood plains, alluvial flats and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
