  "OVERVIEW": "The Puchyan series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in a mantle of sandy eolian deposits;  in the underlying loamy transition layer; and in loess or other silty deposits underlain by  loamy till on moraines. Slope ranges from 2 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",

The typical pedons in all three surveys have redox features above 40 inches. Therefore, this revision changes the concept of th series to moderately well drained only (Arenic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs).\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  Ochric epipedon - 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches) (Ap); Argillic horizon - 69 to 117 cm (27 to 46 inches) (2Bt1, 2Bt2, and 3Bt3);   Arenic feature - loamy fine sand or coarser in all horizons from the soil surface to the top of the argillic at a depth of 69 cm (27 inches) (Ap, Bw1, Bw2); oxyaquic feature  redox accumulations and saturation within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
