    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Puchyan soils are on moraines  in association with soils formed in glacial till. Slope ranges from 2 to 12 percent.  Puchyan soils formed in sandy eolian deposits, in a loamy transition layer, and in loess or other silty deposits which, in turn, are underlain by loamy glacial till.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.2 to 11.3 degrees C (45 to 53 degrees F)."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high to very high (42.34 to 141.14 micrometers per second) in the sandy mantle and moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the underlying deposits.  Permeability is rapid in the sandy mantle and moderate in the underlying deposits. These soils have a perched seasonal high water table within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches) for one month or more per year in 6 or more out of 10 years."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil formerly was called Rio and later, Columbus series.\n11/04  5400 acres have been correlated in three surveys.  The typical pedons in all three surveys have redox features above 40 inches. Therefore, this revision changes the concept of th series to moderately well drained only (Arenic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs).\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  Ochric epipedon - 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches) (Ap); Argillic horizon - 69 to 117 cm (27 to 46 inches) (2Bt1, 2Bt2, and 3Bt3);   Arenic feature - loamy fine sand or coarser in all horizons from the soil surface to the top of the argillic at a depth of 69 cm (27 inches) (Ap, Bw1, Bw2); oxyaquic feature  redox accumulations and saturation within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
