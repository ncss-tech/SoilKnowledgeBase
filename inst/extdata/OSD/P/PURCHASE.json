Reaction ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid in the upper part of the solum, and moderately acid to strongly acid in the lower part, except for the surface layer in areas that have been limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe BE and Bw horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Redoximorphic features are in shades of brown and gray.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe Btx and Bx horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Redoximorphic features (relic) are in shades of gray and brown.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe BC horizon, and C horizon where present, has color range similar to the Btx and Bx horizon.  Redoximorphic features are in shades of gray and brown.  Texture is silt loam or, below 60 inches, loam."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brandon, Feliciana, Grenada, Lax, Lexington, Loring, Memphis, Providence, and Smithdale series.  Brandon and Lax soils are on similar positions and contain a gravelly substratum within 4 feet of the surface.  Feliciana and Memphis soils do not have a fragipan and are generally on higher portions of the landscape.  Grenada soils have a glossic horizon, are deeper to the fragipan, and occupy broader summit positions.  Lexington and Providence soils are on similar positions and have more than 15 percent sand in the lower part of the subsoil.  Loring soils are generally on shoulders and crests above the Purchase soils and are deeper to the fragipan.  Smithdale soils occur on steeper side slope positions and formed in loamy Coastal Plain sediments."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Purchase soils were previously mapped as severely eroded soils that were taxadjunct to the Loring series because they were shallow to the depth of the fragipan and did not contain an argillic horizon above the fragipan.  Fragic properties within this soil create a \"quasi\" perched water table from 0.5 to 1.5 feet during periods of high rainfall, with water moving laterally under non-reducing conditions.  Field observations indicate this zone is not saturated (i.e., at zero or positive pressure) for >30 days in most years.  The apparent water table is below the fragipan at depths greater than 48 inches.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric Epipedon--the zone from the surface to about 7 inches (Ap horizon)\nFragipan--the zone from 7 to about 51 inches (Btx and Bx horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 7 inches to about 31 inches (Btx horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data on the typifying pedon were obtained from the University of Kentucky and NSSL, sample S92KY-83-2.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
