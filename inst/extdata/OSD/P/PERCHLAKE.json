  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates is greater than 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the pedon.  Redox depletions with a chroma of 2 or less are within 30 inches.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout the pedon.  These soils have either a E & Bt, Bt, 2Bt, or 2Btg horizon or any combination of those horizons, but the total thickness of illuvial layers is less than 6 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 or 3.  Uncultivated pedons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have a thin Oe or Oa horizon of decomposed leaf litter with colors similar to the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand.\nThe E part of the E & Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loamy fine sand, sand or fine sand.  The Bt part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand, but may be sand or fine sand with a high clay content.  The total thickness of the lamellae ranges from 1/16 to 5 inches.\nSome pedons have a Bt horizon which has colors and textures similar to the Bt part of the E&Bt horizon.\nThe 2Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  It is at depths of 40 inches or more.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is sand, loamy sand or fine sand.

Aylmer, Barber, Hiwood, Lino, Manistique, Meehan, Poppelton, Redby, Rushlake, Sciota and Winterfield do not have lamellae in the series control section.  Manistique soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Clearriver, Poppleton, Redby, and Rushlake have carbonates in the series control section.  Winterfield soils have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with increasing depth."
