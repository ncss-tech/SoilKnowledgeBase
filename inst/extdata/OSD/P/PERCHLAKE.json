  "OVERVIEW": "The Perchlake series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in sandy outwash or lacustrine deposits on outwash plains and glacial lake plains.  Permeability is rapid.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
