  "OVERVIEW": "The Paul series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources, but mainly from sandstone and limestone. Paul soils are on alluvial fans and river terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 280 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
