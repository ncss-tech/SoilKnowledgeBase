Silt content in the control section ranges from 20 to 55 percent.  Depth to the Btv horizon ranges from 24 to 58 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3; or it is neutral with value of 3 or 4.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam or silt loam\nThe Btv horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to seven and chroma of 4 to 8. Redoximorphic features in shades of red, yellow, brown and gray range from common to many. Some pedons have no dominant color and are variegated in shades of red, brown, yellow or gray.  Percent by volume of plinthite is 5 to 25 percent.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam or silt loam and includes clay loam and sandy clay loam below a depth of about 40 inches.\nThe BC or CB horizons, where present, has the same range of colors and textures as the Btv horizon."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Brogdon series is the only known series in the same family. The Compass and Perdido series are in closely related families. The well drained Brogdon soils are bisequal.  The moderately well drained Compass soils have less than 20 percent silt in the control section. The well drained Perdido soils have redder upper subsoils."

The poorly drained Atmore soils are on lower, dominantly depressional, positions.  The somewhat poorly drained Escambia and Robertsdale soils are on slightly lower positions and have less than 5 percent, by volume, ironstone concretions in their control sections. In addition, Robertsdale soils have fine-loamy control sections. The moderately well drained Irvington soils are on slightly lower positions, have fine-loamy control sections and have a fragipan. The moderately well drained Saucier soils are on slightly lower positions and have fine-loamy control sections.  Fuquay and Stilson soils are on similar positions but have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick.  In addition, Fuquay soils are well drained while Stilson soils are moderately well drained and have less than 5 percent, by volume, plinthite. Malbis and Notcher soils are on similar positions but have fine-loamy control sections. In addition, Notcher soils are moderately well drained."
