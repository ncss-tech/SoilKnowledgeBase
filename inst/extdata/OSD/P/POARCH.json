  "OVERVIEW": "The Poarch series consists of very deep, moderately well and well drained, moderately permeable soils on uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area (MLRA 133A).  They formed in unconsolidated sandy and loamy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 56 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.",

The somewhat poorly drained Escambia and Robertsdale soils are on slightly lower positions and have less than 5 percent, by volume, ironstone concretions in their control sections. In addition, Robertsdale soils have fine-loamy control sections. The moderately well drained Irvington soils are on slightly lower positions, have fine-loamy control sections and have a fragipan. The moderately well drained Saucier soils are on slightly lower positions and have fine-loamy control sections.  Fuquay and Stilson soils are on similar positions but have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick.  In addition, Fuquay soils are well drained while Stilson soils are moderately well drained and have less than 5 percent, by volume, plinthite. Malbis and Notcher soils are on similar positions but have fine-loamy control sections. In addition, Notcher soils are moderately well drained."
