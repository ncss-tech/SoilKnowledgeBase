  "OVERVIEW": "The Pimogran series consists of shallow, excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rock.  Pimogran soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
