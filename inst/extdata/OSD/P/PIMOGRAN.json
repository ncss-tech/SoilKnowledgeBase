    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pimogran soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rock.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 5,800 to 8,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 24 inches, the mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
