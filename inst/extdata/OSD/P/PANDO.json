  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick.  The soils are usually noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches and are always noncalcareous to depths of more than 40 inches.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent in all sub horizons of the argillic horizon, and usually is more than 80 percent.  Depth to the sandy-skeletal IIC horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the top of the argillic horizon is less than 24 inches, and depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon and are usually less than 3 inches in diameter.  The soils range from medium acid to mildly alkaline throughout the profile.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically gravelly or very gravelly sandy loam and has 8 to 18 percent clay in the fine earth fraction.\nThe IIC horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  It is usually very gravelly sand or very gravelly loamy sand."

The soils formed in alluvial parent materials or glacial outwash derived from a variety of crystalline rock but mainly gneiss and schist.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 18 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  The mean annual temperature is 36 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 51 degrees F."
