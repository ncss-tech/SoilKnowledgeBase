  "OVERVIEW": "The soils of the Pando series are deep, well-drained soils formed in alluvium or glacial outwash derived from a variety of crystalline rock but mainly gneiss and schist.  They occur on alluvial fans and high terraces and slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.",
