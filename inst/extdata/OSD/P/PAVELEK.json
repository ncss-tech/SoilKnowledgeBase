  "REVDATE": "11/2010",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pavelek series are soils that are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon.  These well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in clayey sediments over noncalcareous weakly cemented siltstone bedrock interbedded with layers of soft calcium carbonate of the Catahoula Formation.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping, plane to slightly convex surfaces on ridges of inland, dissected coastal plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (73 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm (24 in).",
