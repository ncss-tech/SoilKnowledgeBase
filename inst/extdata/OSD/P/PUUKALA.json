The soils are on all hillslope positions of constructional landscapes consisting of nearly level to moderately steep pahoehoe lava flows that are 3,000 to 5,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over pahoehoe lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 510 to 1270 millimeters (20 to 50 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from April through October.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1020 to 1780 millimeters (40 to 70 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 56 degrees F).  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
