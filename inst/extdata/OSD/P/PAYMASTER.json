    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Crucitas (NM), Haozous (NM), Janude (NE), Kaskan (KS), Lamesilla (NM), and Payter (CO) series.  Crucitas soils average more than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, have significant amounts of medium to very coarse angular granitic sands, and have sandy skeletal substratum. Haozous and Lamesilla (aka Maseeya) soils have AC horizons on the soil surface that are not a part of the mollic epipedon and have sandy skeletal substratum deeper than 60 inches. Janude, Paymaster, and Payter soils average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, do not have significant amounts of medium to very coarse angular granitic sands, and do not have sandy skeletal substratum. Haozous soils formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist and the mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches. Janude and Kaskan soils have an Ustic moisture regime bordering on Udic, with an average annual precipitation of 28 to 30 inches. Kaskan soils have wet soil moisture status at greater than 5 feet. Lamesilla soils have matrix hues redder than 10YR; are formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist; and have mean annual precipitation of 12 to 14 inches."

These soils formed in alluvium derived from granite, limestone, basalt, and acid igneous rock.  The climate is semiarid with an average annual precipitation of 12 to 17 inches and a mean annual temperature of 47 to 56 degrees F.  The frost free season ranges from 150 to 180 days."
