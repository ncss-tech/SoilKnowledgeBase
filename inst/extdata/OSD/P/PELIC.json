  "OVERVIEW": "The Pelic series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Pelic soils are on flood plains and oxbows.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 127 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
