These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks such as granite, basalt, and andesite.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,158 to 1,250 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C, The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."
