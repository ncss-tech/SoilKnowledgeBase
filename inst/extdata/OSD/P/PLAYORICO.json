  "OVERVIEW": "The Playorico series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite and/or sedimentary rock with occasional human transported material overtop. The Playorico soils are on flood plains. The mean annual precipitation is about 356 millimeters (14 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C. (63 degrees F.) Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.",
