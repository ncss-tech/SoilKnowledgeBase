  "OVERVIEW": "The Purdham Series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum from tilted, fractured and folded sandstone over shale dominantly of Pennsylvanian age.  These level to moderately steep soils are on hills and ridges of the Ouachita Mountains; MLRA 119.  Slope range from 0 to 15 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to shale or interbedded shale and sandstone bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Due to the wavy boundary between the 2Bt horizon and the underlying tilted bedrock, it is extremely variable within short distances.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid A, BA, horizons and from very strongly acid to extremely acid in the Bt and 2Bt horizons.  Sandstone fragments less than 3 inches in diameter and/or less than 6 inches in length range from about 5 to 60  percent by volume in the A and BA horizons.  Sandstone fragments less than 3 inches in diameter and/or less than 6 inches in length range from 35 to 60 percent in the Bt horizon.  Shale and sandstone fragments less than 6 inches in length range from 20 to 60 percent by volume in the 2Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of  4, and chroma of 3 or 4, or where the A horizon is less than 6 inches thick, it includes hue of 10YR, value of 3 and chroma of 2.  Texture is fine sandy loam, silt loam, or their gravelly, or very gravelly analogs.\nThe BA horizon has hue of  7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4 or 6, or value of 5 and chroma of 6 or 8.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or their gravelly, or very gravelly analogs.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Some pedons contain iron accumulations and depletions in shades of brown, yellow and red.  Texture is very gravelly loam, very channery loam, very gravelly clay loam, or very channery clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizons have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8, and iron accumulations and depletions in shades of red, brown, yellow and gray.  Some pedons do not have dominant matrix hue and are variegated in shades of red, brown, yellow and gray.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or their channery, very channery, or extremely channery analogs.\nThe 2Cr horizon is soft weathered shale bedrock, or interbedded shale and sandstone or siltstone bedrock in various shades of black, olive, gray, brown, red, and yellow.  The beds have a dip of more than 20 degrees from horizontal."

Littlefir soils, which occur on similar landscapes, have a 20 to 50 inch solum and are in a fine family.  Psyam soils, which occur on drainageways and valley floors, have a solum over 60 inches, are in a fine-loamy family and are moderately well drained."
