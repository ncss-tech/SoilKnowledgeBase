  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Polacca soils are on stream terraces with slope gradients of 0 to 3 percent.  Flooding is rare and very brief.  Elevations are 5100 to 6000 feet.  They formed in stream alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks, dominantly shale and sandstone.  The climate is cool, arid and continental with precipitation of 6 to 10 inches which occurs as thunderstorms in July, August, and September and as rain and snow in December, January, and February.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 51 to 54 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 130 to 160 days."

Tewa and Wepo soils are on stream terraces.  Tewa soils are fine-loamy and Wepo soils are fine.  Both lack contrasting particle size."
