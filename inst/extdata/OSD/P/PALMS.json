  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Klossner soils have A horizons directly below the organic matter that is more than 20 cm (8 inches) thick. Linwood soils formed mainly in woody fibers. Medo soils have less than 10 percent clay in the lower one third of the series control section. Natchaug soils are in areas where the mean annual precipitation is greater than 1092 mm (43 inches). Philbon soils have dominantly fibric and hemic material in the upper 30 cm (12 inches). Shalcar soils have a difference between mean annual summer and mean annual winter temperatures that is less than 26 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Palms soils are in closed depressions on lake plains, till plains, outwash plains, moraines, hillside seep areas, and in backswamps on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Palms soils formed herbaceous organic materials and the underlying loamy deposits. The soils on nearby uplands are generally loamy. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1092 mm (30 to 43 inches). Frost-free period is 120 to 180 days. Elevation is 177 to 466 meters (580 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level."

Houghton soils formed in herbaceous organic deposits more than 130 cm (51 in) thick. Adrian soils are underlain by sandy material at depth of 41 to 130 cm (16 to 51 in). Edwards soils are underlain by marly material at depth of 41 to 130 cm (16 to 51 in). Henrietta soils are in transition areas from the organic depressions to the surrounding mineral soils, and formed in organic materials less than 41 cm (16 in) thick. Barry and Gilford soils formed in the surrounding loamy or loamy over sandy material."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between November and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity ranges from moderately high or high in the organic material and moderately high to low in the loamy material. Permeability is moderately slow to moderately rapid in the organic material and moderate or moderately slow in the loamy material."
