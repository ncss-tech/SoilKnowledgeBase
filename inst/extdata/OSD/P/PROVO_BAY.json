  "OVERVIEW": "The Provo Bay series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from limestone, quartzite, and shale.  The Provo Bay soils are on valley floors. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

Fine snail shells range from few to numerous. The weighted average calcium carbonate content above a depth of 40 inches is more than 40 percent. Salinity ranges from slightly to moderate. Layers of peat may occur and are less than 12 inches thick. Calcic horizons occur within a depth of 16 inches. These soils are neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 10 to 40 inch control section is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay loam containing 18 and 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 to 5 dry. The mollic epipedon is more than 16 inches thick and organic matter content ranges from 5 to 10 percent.\nThe C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2."

(Ak1, Ak2, Ak3, and Ak4 horizons)\nCalcic horizon - the zone of calcium carbonate accumulation at depths of 0 to 33 inches. (Ak1, Ak2, Ak3, Ak4, and Ck horizons)\nThe classification is based on the \"Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eighth Edition, 1998\".  This series was last reviewed in the field in 1972.  Depth and duration of the seasonal high water table needs to be verified in the field.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
