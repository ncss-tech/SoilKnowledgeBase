The soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Elevations are 1,710 to 2,140 meters. The climate is cool and semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
