  "OVERVIEW": "The Pern series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Pern soils are on inset fans, fan skirts, and alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
