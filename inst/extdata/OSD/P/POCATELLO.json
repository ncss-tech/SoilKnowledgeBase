  "OVERVIEW": "The Pocatello series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and silty alluvium derived from loess.  Permeability is moderate.  These soils are on foothills and terraces and have slopes of 0 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
