Other features: some pedons contain only a BA horizon in this material and some pedons contain both BA and Bw horizons.  The Bw horizon contains clay films on faces of peds on some pedons.\n2Bt horizon;\nHue: typically 10YR or 7.5YR, but some pedons have one or more subhorizons with hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 8.\nValue: 4 to 6\nChroma: 3 to 8\nTexture:  commonly clay loam but some pedons have subhorizons that are loam or clay depending on the degree of truncation. Vertical wedges of sandy loam or loamy sand are in the till in some pedons.\nReaction: strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part, moderately acid to neutral in the lower part\nOther features:  Many of the properties of the 2Bt horizon are believed to be inherited from a paleosol of probable Sangamon age truncated by Wisconsinan glacial meltwaters.\n2C horizon (where present):\nHue: 10YR or 7.5YR in the matrix\nValue: 4 to 6\nChroma: 4 to 8\nTexture: clay loam, loam or silt loam\nReaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline and do not have free carbonates above a depth of 152 cm (60 inches)\nOther features: commonly has redoximorphic features with low and high chroma."

They formed in 33 to 86 cm (13 to 34 inches) of loamy aeolian sediments and in paleosols of Sangamon age formed in Illinoian till.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 3.0 to 11.1 degrees C (37 to 52 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 914 mm (32 to 36 inches)."

The well drained Parr soils and the somewhat poorly drained Odell soils have thinner sola and commonly occur downslope from Prairieville soils in calcareous loam till and commonly are adjacent to major drainageways.  The somewhat poorly drained Nachusa soils and the poorly drained Wolcott soils form a drainage sequence with Prairieville soils."
