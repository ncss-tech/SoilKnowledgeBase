  "OVERVIEW": "The Parmalee series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on lake plains. They formed in loamy and silty lacustrine deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 711 mm (28 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",
