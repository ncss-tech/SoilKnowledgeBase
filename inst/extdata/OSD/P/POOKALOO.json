  "OVERVIEW": "The Pookaloo series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone, dolomite, and calcareous siltstone. Pookaloo soils are on mountains and hills. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
