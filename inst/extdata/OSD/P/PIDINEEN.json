  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to petrocalcic horizon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The soils ar calcareous throughout in most pedons.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 3 to 15 percent throughout the soil material.  Rock fragments are basalt on the surface and basalt and caliche in the profile.  Soil temperature at 20 inches is less than 54 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Rock fragments range from 1 to 10 percent stones, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, and 2 to 5 percent pebbles.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It commonly is light clay loam, but the range includes loam and silt loam.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 3 percent stones, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, and 2 to 5 percent pebbles.\nThe C horizon is lacking in some pedons.  It is loam or silt loam containing 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 15 to 25 percent pebbles."

The soils formed in alluvial material derived mainly from basalt with eolian modification.  Elevation is 6,500 to 7,200 feet.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  The frost free season is 140 to 155 days."
