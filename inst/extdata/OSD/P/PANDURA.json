Base saturation below a depth of 10 inches is more than 80 percent.  The soil has common or many fine quartz grains throughout.\nThe A horizons have hues of 7.5YR and 10YR, values of 3 and 4, and chroma of 3 and 4.  They are loam or sandy loam.\nThe B horizons have hues of 7.5YR through 2.5Y and values and chromas of 3 to 6.  They are loam or sandy loam and have weak medium or fine subangular blocky structure or subhorizons are massive.\nThe C horizons have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 5 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 6.  They are loam or sandy loam."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other known series in the same family.  The Caguabo, Cuchillas, Dique, Juana Diaz, Juncos, Junquitos, Malaya, Mani, Maraguez, Maresua, Montegrande, Morado, Mucara, Plata, Quebrada, and Vivi series are similar soils in related families.  Caguabo and Malaya soils have hard rock within a depth of 20 inches.  Cuchillas soils have an isothermic temperature regime.  Dique and Vivi soils have an irregular decrease in organic matter with depth.  Juana Diaz soils have an ustic moisture regime.  Juncos, Montegrande, and Mucara soils have higher COLE values and crack when dry.  Junquitos and Mani soils have low chroma mottles.  Maraguez, Morado, and Quebrada soils lack a paralithic contact within a depth of 20 inches.  Maresua and Plata soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Pandura soils are sloping to steep and on side slopes of dissected uplands.  Slope gradients range from 20 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in loamy residuum from partially weathered plutonic rocks, mainly quartz diorite and granodiorite.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average yearly precipitation is 75 to 85 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 76 to 80 degrees F."

The Candelero, Cayagua and Mayo soils occur in terraces and footslopes and have thicker profiles.  The Ingenio, Jagueyes, Limones, Lirios, Patillas and Teja soils are in similar side slopes.  The Ingenio, Jagueyes, Limones, Lirios and Patillas soils are more weathered and have redder profiles.  The Teja soils have hard rock within 20 inches of the surface."
