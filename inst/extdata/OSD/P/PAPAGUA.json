  "OVERVIEW": "The Papagua series consists of deep, moderately well drained, nearly level, slowly permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy eolian sediments of Holocene age over loamy alluvial sediments of Quaternary age.  These nearly level soils are in depressions.  The soil is ponded for short periods after heavy rains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in).",
