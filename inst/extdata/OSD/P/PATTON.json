Drummer soils do not have dominantly very fine or fine sand fraction in the lower part of the series control section. Dunham soils have subhorizons with more than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Elvira soils have redox concentrations with hue redder than 7.5YR in the Bg horizon. Garwin and Mascoutah soils have less than 7 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.

The well drained Camden and Markland soils and the moderately well drained Uniontown soils do not have a mollic epipedon and have an argillic horizon. They are on nearby higher-lying or more sloping stream terraces. The somewhat poorly drained Harco soils have carbonates at depths less than 102 cm (40 inches), are on slightly higher parts of stream terraces, and form a hydro-sequence with Patton soils. The somewhat poorly drained Henshaw, McGary, and Starks soils do not have a mollic epipedon and have an argillic horizon. These soils are on similar but slightly higher stream terraces. The somewhat poorly drained Marissa soils have an albic horizon and an argillic horizon, and are on slightly higher stream terraces. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Montgomery and Zipp soils contain more clay in the control section. In addition, Zipp soils do not have a mollic epipedon. Montgomery and Zipp soils are on adjacent or somewhat lower parts of glacial lake plains and stream terraces."

Flooded phases are recognized with flooding frequency ranging from rare to frequent (see Remarks)."

The current concept of the Patton series does not place them on active flood plains.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 38 cm (15 inches) (Ap and A horizons).\nCambic horizon: from a depth 38 to 89 cm (15 to 35 inches) (Bg1, Bg2, and Bg3 horizons).\nAquic conditions: redox features in the lower part of the mollic as well as gray matrix and redox features in underlying horizons."
