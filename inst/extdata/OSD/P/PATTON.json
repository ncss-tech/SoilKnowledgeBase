Chalmers soils have less than 20 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Chetomba, Hartsburg, Madelia, Pella, Rushmore, and Wacousta soils have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Dolbee, Elpaso, Marcus, and Sable soils do not have stratification in the lower part of the series control section. Drummer soils do not have dominantly very fine or fine sand fraction in the lower part of the series control section. Dunham soils have subhorizons with more than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Elvira soils have redox concentrations with hue redder than 7.5YR in the Bg horizon. Garwin and Mascoutah soils have less than 7 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Gillett Grove, Maxcreek, Maxfield, and Maxmore soils have more than 25 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Ossian soils average less than 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Patton soils are on nearly level to depressional parts of stream terraces and glacial lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Patton soils formed in glaciolacustrine deposits and typically are underlain by stratified silty and loamy outwash sediments of Wisconsinan age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 88 to 1219 mm (35 to 48 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F)."

The well drained Camden and Markland soils and the moderately well drained Uniontown soils do not have a mollic epipedon and have an argillic horizon. They are on nearby higher-lying or more sloping stream terraces. The somewhat poorly drained Harco soils have carbonates at depths less than 102 cm (40 inches), are on slightly higher parts of stream terraces, and form a hydro-sequence with Patton soils. The somewhat poorly drained Henshaw, McGary, and Starks soils do not have a mollic epipedon and have an argillic horizon. These soils are on similar but slightly higher stream terraces. The somewhat poorly drained Marissa soils have an albic horizon and an argillic horizon, and are on slightly higher stream terraces. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Montgomery and Zipp soils contain more clay in the control section. In addition, Zipp soils do not have a mollic epipedon. Montgomery and Zipp soils are on adjacent or somewhat lower parts of glacial lake plains and stream terraces."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. Potential for surface water runoff is negligible to low. Ponding typically occurs in the spring. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high throughout.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and typically is moderately slow in the substratum. Flooded phases are recognized with flooding frequency ranging from rare to frequent (see Remarks)."

The current concept of the Patton series does not place them on active flood plains.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 38 cm (15 inches) (Ap and A horizons).\nCambic horizon: from a depth 38 to 89 cm (15 to 35 inches) (Bg1, Bg2, and Bg3 horizons).\nAquic conditions: redox features in the lower part of the mollic as well as gray matrix and redox features in underlying horizons.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
