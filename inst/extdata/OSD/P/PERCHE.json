Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is stratified loam, silt loam, loamy sand, sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. Some pedons have a gleyed horizon below 20 inches and some pedons have buried surface layers. Cg horizons, where present, have chroma of 2 only."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 4 inches (Ap horizon); Fluvent feature - an irregular decrease in organic carbon. Aquic feature - low chroma mottles above 16 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Typifying pedon was analyzed by the University of Missouri Soil Characterization Lab as number M9101939. Characterization data on four other pedons from Boone County are also available.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
