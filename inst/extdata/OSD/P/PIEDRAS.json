  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were previously included in the Cuevitas and Randado series. They are separated based on high coarse fragment content and absence of an argillic horizon respectively. A Petrocalcidic and Petrocalcic subgroup will be proposed to include this soil, and similar soils with a petrocalcic horizon within 102 cm (40 in) of the surface. The classification will include those soils that are noncalcareous in one or more horizons above the petrocalcic horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in). (A and A/Bk horizons)\nPetrocalcic horizon: 25 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in). (Bkkm horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the geographic area. Particle-size analysis was performed at the local project office for 7 pedons from Duval County.\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
