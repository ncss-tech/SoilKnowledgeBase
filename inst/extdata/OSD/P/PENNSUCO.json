  "OVERVIEW": "The Pennsuco series consists of deep, poorly and very poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on lowlands only a few feet above sea level in the Lower Coastal Plain of Florida.  They formed in recent finely divided stratified calcareous sediments that were deposited in marine or fresh waters over limestone.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 74 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches.  Slopes are less than 1 percent.",

Reaction is moderately alkaline, in the A and B horizons and neutral to moderately alkaline in the 2C horizon.  Thin laminations or varving are clearly evident in many pedons.\nThe Oa horizon, where present, is a thin layer of organic material with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is muck.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, or gray range from none to common.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4; or there is no dominant color and it is multicolored in shades of brown, yellow, and gray.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, or gray range from few to many.  Texture is silt or silt loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has the same range of colors as the Bg horizon.  Masses or thin discontinuous lenses of muck or mucky silt loam range from none to common.  Texture is silt loam or silt.\nThe 2C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of soft weathered limestone.  Solution holes range from few to common throughout and extend 1 to 2 feet into the limestone.  They are filled with sand, silt loam, or soft carbonatic material."

The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 55 to 65 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 73 to 75 degrees F."

Vegetation in undrained areas consists of sawgrass, reeds, sedges, grasses, and scattered cabbage palm."

Tidal areas are flooded by daily or seasonal tides.\nPennsuco soils have structure but the organic carbon content is too high for a cambic horizon.  Moist color would put this soil in an Aeric family, but the soil is too wet to be so classified."
