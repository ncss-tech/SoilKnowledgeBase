    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Soil thickness and depth to limestone ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Reaction is moderately alkaline, in the A and B horizons and neutral to moderately alkaline in the 2C horizon.  Thin laminations or varving are clearly evident in many pedons.\nThe Oa horizon, where present, is a thin layer of organic material with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is muck.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, or gray range from none to common.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4; or there is no dominant color and it is multicolored in shades of brown, yellow, and gray.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, or gray range from few to many.  Texture is silt or silt loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has the same range of colors as the Bg horizon.  Masses or thin discontinuous lenses of muck or mucky silt loam range from none to common.  Texture is silt loam or silt.\nThe 2C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of soft weathered limestone.  Solution holes range from few to common throughout and extend 1 to 2 feet into the limestone.  They are filled with sand, silt loam, or soft carbonatic material."

They formed in deposits of mostly silt-size sediments that are 90 to 95 percent calcium carbonate and are on the Miami Oolite Formation of Pleistocene Age.  Elevation is 1 to 4 feet above sea level.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 55 to 65 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 73 to 75 degrees F."

Large areas inland from the coastal swamps have been drained and used for potatoes, beans, corn, tomatoes, other truck crops and ornamental nursery stock.  Vegetation in undrained areas consists of sawgrass, reeds, sedges, grasses, and scattered cabbage palm."

Tidal areas are flooded by daily or seasonal tides.\nPennsuco soils have structure but the organic carbon content is too high for a cambic horizon.  Moist color would put this soil in an Aeric family, but the soil is too wet to be so classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
