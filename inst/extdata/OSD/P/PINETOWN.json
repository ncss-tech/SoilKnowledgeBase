  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinetown series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  Pinetown soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes range from 4 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
