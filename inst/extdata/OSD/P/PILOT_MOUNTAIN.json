  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The high content of rock fragments throughout the soil profile and increased clay in the lower Bt horizon restricts vertical water movement within these soils and increases lateral water movement. This results in the formation of masses of oxidized iron within the B and C horizons of most pedons. Although, this process results in the development of redoximorphic features, water is not present in the soil profile for a significant enough period to identify aquic conditions or a seasonal high water table.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface to 12 inches (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 12 to 30 inches (Bt horizon)\nOther soil features identified with this pedon:\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory Data: Series classification based on sample pedon S92NC-171-005 from the type location and data from several other pedons of the Pilot Mountain soils in Surry County, NC and Patrick County, VA.\nDatabase Information:\nTypical Pedon Data Mapunit ID--82722\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSlope  Airtemp  FrFr/Seas  Precip  Elevation\n2-45   52-57    160-205    40-55   1100-2000\nFloodL FloodH Watertable Kind Months Bedrock Hardness\nNONE   -      >6.0       -    -      >60     -\nDepth Texture         3-inches  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\n0-2   SPM MPM HPM     15-80     -      -      75-200\n2-12  FSL SL L        15-80     50-95   5-20   2-20\n12-22 FSL L SCL CL    35-70     50-95  18-40   3-10\n22-30 SCL CL SC C     35-70     50-95  20-50   4-15\n30-60 SCL FSL SL L    15-70     50-95  10-30   2-5\nDepth  -pH-     O.M.
