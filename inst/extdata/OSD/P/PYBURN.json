  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is 30 to 50 inches. The soil is usually moist and is saturated with water during several months each year when not artificially drained. It is dry for a short period of less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 to 12 inches in the four month period following the summer solstice in most years. The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 55 degrees F. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. Clay content decreases by 20 percent from the maximum clay content within 1.5 meters from the soil surface in most pedons. Hue is 10YR to 2.5Y. Reaction is very strongly to moderately acid throughout. The particle-size control section has 40 to 70 percent clay. Redox depletions occur within 10 inches of the mineral soil surface.\nThe A horizon and Ac or Ap horizon, if present, has value of  2 to 5 moist, 3 to 6 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist, 2 or 3 dry. Texture is silty clay with 40 to 50 percent clay.\nThe BA or BAc horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist, 2 or 3 dry.  Texture is silty clay or silty clay loam with 35 to 45 percent clay.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist and dry and chroma of 0 to 2 moist, 2 to 4 dry. Texture is clay, silty clay loam, or silty clay with 35 to 70 percent clay. Redox concentrations are common or many and distinct or prominent. Slickensides are none to common.\nThe BC horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist and dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay or clay with 50 to 70 percent clay. Redox concentrations are common or many and distinct or prominent. Slickensides are few to common and faint or distinct.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 0 to 3 moist and dry. Texture is clay loam, silty clay, or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay. Thin sand and gravel lenses occur in some pedons below depths of 40 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. The Kenusky series has a similar classification. Kenusky soils have mixed mineralogy and do not decrease by 20 percent from the maximum clay content within 1.5 meters from the soil surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pyburn soils occur on high stream terraces. They formed in mixed clayey alluvium from volcanic and sedimentary rock.   Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations are 95 to 1000 feet. The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 100 inches. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F. The frost-free period is 140 to 220 days. Pyburn soils are on the Whiskey Run geomorphic surface in Curry and Coos Counties, and in depressional areas of high stream terraces in Benton County."
