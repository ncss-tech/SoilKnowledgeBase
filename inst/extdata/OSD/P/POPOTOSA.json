  "OVERVIEW": "The Popotosa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Popotosa soils are on nearly level floodplains.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 6l degrees F.",
