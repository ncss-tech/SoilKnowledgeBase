  "OVERVIEW": "The Padus series consists of very deep well drained soils which are moderately deep to stratified sandy outwash. These soils formed mostly in loamy alluvium and are underlain by stratified sandy outwash on glacial lake plains, outwash plains, stream terraces, eskers, kames, and moraines.  Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy mantle and rapid or very rapid in the sandy outwash. Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, thickness and depth are measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Thickness of the loamy deposits and depth to sandy outwash range from 24 to 40 inches.  Volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent in the particle size control section.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 35 percent but is typically less than 15 percent in the loamy mantle.  Volume of gravel averages from 3 to 50 percent in the sandy outwash but ranges from 3 to 60 percent in individual strata. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout.  Stones are on the surface in some areas and a stony phase is recognized.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum but it ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid below the spodic horizon.\nSome pedons have an O horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or the hue is neutral.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 to 3; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A or Ap horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3. It typically is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam but in some pedons it is loamy sand.\nSome pedons have a Bhs horizon, less than 3 inches thick, with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 2 to 3.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4. It has textures like the Bhs horizon above.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Typically, it is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or the gravelly analogs but in some pedons it is loamy sand or the gravelly analog.\nPadus soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E' part has colors and textures like the E' horizon above. The Bt part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 4 or 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nSome pedons have a Bt horizon with colors and textures like the Bt part described above.\nSome pedons have a 2Bt or 2BC horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR and value and chroma 4 to 6.  It is sand, loamy sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is stratified sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly, or very gravelly analogs."
