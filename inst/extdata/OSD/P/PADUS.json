  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, thickness and depth are measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Thickness of the loamy deposits and depth to sandy outwash range from 24 to 40 inches.  Volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent in the particle size control section.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 35 percent but is typically less than 15 percent in the loamy mantle.  Volume of gravel averages from 3 to 50 percent in the sandy outwash but ranges from 3 to 60 percent in individual strata. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout.  Stones are on the surface in some areas and a stony phase is recognized.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum but it ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid below the spodic horizon.\nSome pedons have an O horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or the hue is neutral.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 to 3; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A or Ap horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3. It typically is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam but in some pedons it is loamy sand.\nSome pedons have a Bhs horizon, less than 3 inches thick, with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 2 to 3.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4. It has textures like the Bhs horizon above.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Typically, it is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or the gravelly analogs but in some pedons it is loamy sand or the gravelly analog.\nPadus soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E' part has colors and textures like the E' horizon above. The Bt part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 4 or 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nSome pedons have a Bt horizon with colors and textures like the Bt part described above.\nSome pedons have a 2Bt or 2BC horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR and value and chroma 4 to 6.  It is sand, loamy sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is stratified sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly, or very gravelly analogs."

Goodman soils have a 12 to 40 inch silty mantle and do not have stratified sand and gravel within 40 inches.   Newot,  and Sarona soils do not have stratified sand and gravel within 40 inches. Padwet soils have redoxymorphic features in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Padus soils are on glacial lake plains, outwash plains, stream terraces, eskers, kames, and moraines.  They formed mostly in loamy alluvial deposits underlain by stratified sandy outwash. Slope gradients range from 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 90 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 19500 feet."

The moderately well drained Padwet soils, the somewhat poorly drained Worcester soils, and the poorly drained and very poorly drained Minocqua soils form a drainage sequence with the Padus soils.  The moderately well drained Padwood soils and the somewhat poorly drained Worwood soils from a drainage sequence in nearby areas where the substratum is stratified sandy and loamy deposits at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  The well drained Pence soils are nearby where the loamy deposits are thinner over the sandy and gravelly outwash."

Native vegetation is mostly sugar maple, red maple, northern red oak, American basswood, white ash, and eastern hemlock but bigtooth aspen, red pine, and eastern white pine are in some stands.  Some areas have been cleared and are used for cropland.  Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay. Some areas are used for growing potatoes."
