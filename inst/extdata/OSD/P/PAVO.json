  "OVERVIEW": "The Pavo series consists of deep, moderately permeable, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and material derived from tuff and pumice.  Pavo soils are on toeslopes.  Slopes are 5 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
