The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 30 to 76 cm (1 to 2.5 feet) between December and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the loamy and sandy deposits, and moderately high in the underlying silty sediments. Permeability is moderately rapid in the loamy and sandy deposits, and moderately slow in the underlying silty sediments."
