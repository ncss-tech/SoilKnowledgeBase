Coxlake soils have redoximorphic features at a depth of less than 30 inches. Deerspring soils do not have Bw horizons and have a xeric soil moisture regime. Endersby soils slightly or moderately alkaline in the lower part and have a xeric soil moisture regime. Evans soils do not have rock fragments in the control section and have a xeric soil moisture regime. Flofeather soils are somewhat excessively drained and do not have redoximorphic features. Lapwai soils are well drained and have calcareous horizons with secondary carbonates at a depth of 30 to 40 inches. Leavenworth soils do not have Bw horizons and have a xeric soil moisture regime. Narcisse soils have redoximorphic features above 40 inches, do not have Bw horizons, and have a xeric soil moisture regime. Okanogan soils are well drained, do not have Bw horizons, and have a xeric bordering on aridic soil moisture regime. Patit Creek soils have horizons with more than 35 percent rock fragments and have a xeric soil moisture regime. Pleasent View soils have calcareous horizons and have a xeric soil moisture regime. Plinco soils do not have Bw horizons and combined thickness of the A horizons is greater than 40 inches. Poween soils are moderately or strongly alkaline throughout and have a xeric soil moisture regime. Redola soils are calcareous throughout and are slightly or moderately alkaline.
