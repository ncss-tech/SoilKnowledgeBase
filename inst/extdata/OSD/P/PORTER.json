  "OVERVIEW": "The Porter series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in alluvium from igneous rocks and lacustrine deposits. Slopes range from 1 to 4 percent in valleys and foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
