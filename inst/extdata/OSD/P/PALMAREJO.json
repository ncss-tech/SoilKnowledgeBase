  "REVDATE": "09/2006",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Palmarejo series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils on foot slopes, toe slopes, and alluvial fans of the Semiarid Coastal Plains MLRA.  They formed in sediments that weathered from volcanic rocks.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.",
