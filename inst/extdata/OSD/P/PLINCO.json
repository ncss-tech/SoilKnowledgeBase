Endersby soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 51 to 55 degrees F and are mildly or moderately alkaline in the C horizon.  Evans soils are dry only 60 consecutive days and have no rock fragments in the control section.  Leavenworth soils contain lenses of loamy fine sand throughout and contain less than 10 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Narcisse soils are dry 60 to 80 days, have a B horizon with prismatic structure are mottled between a depth of 25 to 48 inches and contain no gravel.  Patit Creek soils have an average texture of silt loam in the control section and contain 35 to 80 percent gravel in the C horizon.  Pleasant View soils are mildly to moderately alkaline throughout and have a Cca horizon with a calcium carbonate equivalent of 12 to 25 percent.  Redola soils have an epipedon less than 35 inches thick, are mildly to moderately alkaline throughout, are calcareous throughout and have no gravel in the control section."
