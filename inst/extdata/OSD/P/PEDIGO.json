  "STATES": "OR,WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pedigo series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in silty alluvium from loess with some volcanic ash.  Pedigo soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 to 55 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days during the 3 months following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to more than 40 inches thick. The particle-size control section is dominantly silt loam, but in some pedons there are thin lenses (less than 1 inch) of very fine sandy loam or layers of silty clay loam; however, it averages silt loam with 10 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than fine sand.  Reaction is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist or dry.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1, 2, or 3 dry or moist."

Covello and Hermiston soils are not calcareous in the upper part of the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Mondovi soils have a moist value of 2 to a depth of 40 inches or more and are noncalcareous.  Onyx soils are noncalcareous.  Powder soils have a B2 horizon with segregated lime, are well and moderately well drained and are usually dry."

The soils formed in silty alluvium from loess and some volcanic ash washed from uplands.  Summers are hot and dry and winters are cold and moist.  Average annual precipitation is 10 to 18 inches.  Average January temperature is about 30 degrees F, average July temperature is about 70 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 53 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is about 110 to 180 days."

Ahtanum and Umapine soils are strongly saline-alkali affected.  Also, Ahtanum soils have a duripan at a depth of 20 to 40 inches and Umapine soils lack a mollic epipedon.  Athena soils have a regular distribution of organic matter with increasing depth.  Walla Walla soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick.  Endersby and Tygh soils are coarse-loamy."
