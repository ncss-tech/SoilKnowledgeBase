  "OVERVIEW": "The Poncho series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from shale and sandstone.  Poncho soils are on cuestas, shale hills and structural benches.  Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
