  "OVERVIEW": "The Pierview series are well drained soils that formed in alluvium weathered from slate and other sedimentary sources. Pierview soils are on remnant alluvial fans and terraces, often in urban areas where surface modification is common. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 410 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C.",
