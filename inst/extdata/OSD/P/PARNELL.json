    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to calcium carbonate ranges from 35 to over 80 inches.  Pedons typically do not have rock fragments, but some pedons contain as much as 8 percent, by volume, in the lower part of the B horizon and in the C horizon.  Stony surface phases have been recognized.  Some pedons have an 0a horizon as much as 6 inches thick. The mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to 80 inches in thickness and typically includes all or part of the B horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1.  It typically is silty clay loam but the range includes silt loam, loam and silty clay.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have an E horizon as much as 4 inches thick.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It commonly is silty clay or silty clay loam but the range includes clay loam or clay.  It typically averages between 40 and 45 percent clay and ranges from 35 to 60 percent and as much as 30 percent sand. B/A clay ratios are 1.2 to 1.8.  The upper part of the B horizon commonly has few to many, thin or medium coatings of clean sand and silt particles on the faces of peds, but such coatings are not present in some pedons.  Clay films range from few to many and faint to distinct with the greatest number being in the middle part of the Btg horizon. The clay films have value of 2 or 3.  The Btg horizon is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon.\nThe BCg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6 chroma of 1 or 2 or less commonly chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  Some ped faces have patchy clay films or organic coatings.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  It has secondary carbonates in some pedons.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 7, chroma of 1 or 2 or less commonly chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  It has secondary carbonates in some pedons.\nSome pedons have a 2Cg horizon that formed in glacial till."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Parnell soils are in depressions, swales and drainageways on ground and end moraines.  Slope gradients are 0 to 3 percent.  Parnell soils formed mostly in water-sorted sediments from glacial till.  Calcareous loam or clay loam glacial till commonly underlies these sediments.  Mean annual air temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 24 inches thick.  Frost-free days range from 120 to 160 days.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 1000 to 1600 feet."

These soils formed in loamy glacial till and are on higher lying or more sloping terrain or both.  Aastad, Aazdahl, Balaton and Svea soils are moderately well drained; Badger and Hamerly soils are somewhat poorly drained; Barnes, Forman, Formdale, Poinsett and Waukon soils are well drained; and Flom and Vallers soils are poorly drained."

Permeability is slow.  In most years a seasonal high water table is at a depth of 0.5 to 1.5 feet during the period November to June for the poorly drained phase and +1 to .5 during the period January to December for the very poorly drained phase."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most undrained areas are in native vegetation with some used for pasture or hayland.  Drained areas are typically used to grow corn, soybeans and small grain. The native vegetation is herbaceous marsh species tolerant of excessive wetness such as, cattails, bulrushes, giant burreed, giant reed grass and hydrophytic sedges."
