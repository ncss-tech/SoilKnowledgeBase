  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the base of soil development and bedrock ranges from 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches). The mollic epipedon ranges from 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches) in thickness. The particle-size control section averages between 25 to 35 percent clay.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loam or silt loam. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Some pedons have hue of 7.5YR in the lower part of the Bt horizon. It is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or silty clay loam. It has less than 7 percent gravel and 3 percent cobbles. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline. Some pedons have carbonates in the lower part. In some pedons the upper part of the Bt horizon is influenced by loess; it is these subhorizons that are silty clay loam.\nThe BCt or BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam. It has less than 10 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline. Most pedons have carbonates. Typically there is no clay layer derived from limestone or dolostone in the Plattville soils; but a layer considered to be a beta - like B, or B development, does occur just above the limestone or dolostone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Plattville soils are on nearly level to rolling till plains and high structural benches. Slope gradients typically are 0 to 6 percent. These soils formed in glacial drift that is underlain by limestone or dolostone bedrock at depths of 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches). Some areas have a thin covering of loess. Also some pedons have a thin layer of till overlying the bedrock. Mean annual temperature is 7 to 12 degrees C (45 to 54 degrees F), mean annual precipitation is 660 to 1016 mm (26 to 40 inches), frost free days range from 140 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 156 to 411 meters (512 to 1350 feet) above sea level."

The poorly drained Faxon and Joliet soils and very poorly drained Millsdale soils are on lower parts of the landscape or in depressions. The moderately deep, well drained Rockton and Whalan soils and the very deep, well drained Waupecan soils are on similar landform positions as the Plattville soils. In addition, Whalan soils lack a mollic epipedon."
