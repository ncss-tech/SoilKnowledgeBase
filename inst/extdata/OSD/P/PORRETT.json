  "OVERVIEW": "The Porrett series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from a mixture of loess and volcanic ash. Porrett soils are on floodplains and floodplain steps and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
