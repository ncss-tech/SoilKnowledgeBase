The soils formed alluvium derived from a mixture of loess and volcanic ash material. Elevations range from 2,100 to 3,200 feet. The climate is subhumid and has a mean annual precipitation of 25 to 41 inches, including 4 to 6 feet of snow. The mean annual air temperature is 41 to 46 degrees F. The frost-free season is 80 to 120 days."
