    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth of secondary calcium carbonates ranges from 20 to 60 inches. Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The A, Bk/Bw, and C horizons are silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3. Some pedons are overwashed with fine sandy loam or textures similar to the A horizon, but have hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4. The overwash material is less than 20 inches thick. Reaction of the Ap or A horizon ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk or Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline. Visible calcium carbonate in the form of masses and films ranges from 0 to 5 percent by volume.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. Thin strata of coarser or fine textures occur in this horizon. Reaction is moderately alkaline and calcareous. Visible calcium carbonate in the form of masses and films ranges from 0 to 5 percent by volume.\nSome pedons have buried horizons below 30 inches. These pedons are not diagnostic. Texture, color, and reactions of these horizons are similar to those described throughout the Port profile."

Soils in similar families are Asher, Bippus, Bosque, Dale, Frio, Gageby, Gowen, Kaski, Lamkin, Lawrie, Nipsum, Reinach, and Spur series. Asher, Lamkin, and Spur soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick. In addition, Spur soils have a fine-loamy control section. Bergstrom soils are calcareous throughout. Bigetty and Iraan soils are dry for longer periods of time. Bippus, Bosque, Gageby, Gowen, and Kaski soils have a fine-loamy control section. Dale and Reinach soils have a regular decrease in organic matter. In addition, Reinach soils have a coarse-silty control section. Elandco soils have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y throughout. Frio and Nipsum soils have a fine control section. Lawrie soils are slightly higher in the landscape, and do not decrease in clay content by 20 percent of the maximum within 60 inches of the mineral soil surface.  Clearfork soils are active CEC activity class."

Ashport and Easpur soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick and are on slightly lower flood plains and closer to the stream. Brewer, Canadian, Dale, Lawrie, McLain, and Reinach soils occur on slightly higher flood plains. Brewer and McLain soils have a fine control section and have argillic horizons. Lawrie soils have argillic horizons. Canadian soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick and have a coarse-loamy control section. Gaddy soils usually occur on slightly lower flood plains closer to the stream channel, have a sandy control section and lack a mollic epipedon. Miller, Pulaski, and Yahola soils occur on similar areas. Miller soils have a fine control section. Pulaski and Yahola soils have a coarse-loamy control section and lack a mollic epipedon."
