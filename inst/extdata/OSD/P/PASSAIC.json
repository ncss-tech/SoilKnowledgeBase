  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is more than  60 inches. Solum thickness corresponds with the depth to the contrasting 2C horizon and commonly is 30 inches but ranges from 24 to 35 inches.  Rock fragments are generally not present but range to 10 percent in subhorizons within the solum.  Gravelly or very gravelly layers or lenses are common in the substrata.  The particle size control section is between the top of the Btg horizon to a depth of 1 meter or about 39 inches.  Clay content in the subhorizons within the solum ranges from 25 to 60 percent but the weighted average percent clay of the upper part of the control section ranges from 35 to 50 percent. The lower part of the control section has contrasting sandy or sandy-skeletal material with less than 15 percent clay, less than 30 percent silt, and more than 70 percent fine sand or coarser.  Unless limed, the surface ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid and the subsoil ranges from strongly acid to neutral.  The C horizons are neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma 1 or 2.  Ap horizons, where present, have hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe ABg horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture is loam or silt loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2 or is neutral.  Texture is silt loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, clay, or silty clay.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is dominantly sand, fine sand, gravelly loamy sand, or very gravelly sand.  In most pedons the sand fraction is dominated by medium or fine sands. Texture ranges from sandy loam to very gravelly sand in lenses or strata, and includes clay or silt textures in varves."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Passaic soils are nearly level and are generally within large topographic basins.  Slope is 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in silty and clayey sediments with sandy or sandy-skeletal, texturally contrasting sediments within 40 inches of the surface.  The substrata are typically sandy lacustrine or outwash deposits but include stony, cobbly, or gravelly glacial tills.  The climate is humid temperate.  Average annual precipitation is 40 to 48 inches and the growing season is about 140 to 170 days.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 to 50 degrees F."

The somewhat poorly drained Haledon soils are on low plains and in nearly level drainageways on moraines.   Parsippany and the somewhat poorly drained Whippany soils do not have contrasting sandy textures within 40 inches of the surface."

Surface runoff is slow to ponded and permeability is moderate in the surface horizons, slow in the subsoil, and moderate to rapid in the substrata.  The water table is at or near the surface throughout the winter and early spring and following periods of heavy rainfall."

In the past, extensive areas have been drained and used for the production of corn, hay, and truck crops.  In general, drainage improvement has been inadequate for sustained production of cultivated crops."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Passaic series was proposed for those soils which have been previously correlated as a Parsippany Variant in both Union and Middlesex Counties in New Jersey.  The Passaic series was used in the past to describe soils similar to what is presently Passaic series.  The name is from the town of Passaic in Passaic County, New Jersey.\nCation-exchange activity class is presumed from a review of data of similar soils. Changes in competing series\nmay result from updates in classification.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon - the zone between 0 and 10 inches (A, ABg)\n2.  Argillic horizon - the zone between 10 and 28 inches (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3) with a average clay content of more than 35 percent  (clayey) over texturally contrasting sandy material (2C-zone of 28 to 60 inches) (sandy or sandy skeletal) within the particle size control section of 10 to 39 inches.\n3. Redoximorphic features are present in all layers between  25 and 40 cm. and more than 50 percent redox depletions with a chroma of 1 or less within the upper 12.5 cm. of the argillic horizon (Btg1).\n4.  Aeric subgroup - the presence of one horizon with both value and chroma of 3 or more in 50 percent or more of the matrix having a hue of 10YR or yellower within 75 cm of the surface (2C horizon beginning at 28 inches is 10YR 4/4).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
