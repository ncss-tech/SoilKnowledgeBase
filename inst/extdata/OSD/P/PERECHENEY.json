Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 61 to 107 cm (2 to 3.5 feet) between November and May in normal years. Water is perched on the 2Bt horizon. Potential for surface runoff is very low to medium depending on slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the sandy material and moderately high in the underlying loamy material. Permeability is rapid in the sandy material and moderately slow in the underlying loamy material."
