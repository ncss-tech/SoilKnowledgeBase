  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Philder series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately slowly permeable above the very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon and moderate below soils that formed in alluvium influenced by eolian material. These nearly level to strongly sloping soils are on erosional fan remnants of the fan piedmont.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

Ferrogold and Wodovar soils contain 8 to 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Orrubo soils have a paralithic contact within 30 inches of the surface.  Paisano soils have less than 20 percent clay in the control section.  Tencee soils are drier in the moisture control section for longer periods (typic-aridic).  Ferrogold, Orrubo, Wechech, and Wodovar soils are moist in the soil moisture control section less than 20 days cumulative between July and September, are in the Typic aridic soil moisture regime, and occur in the Mohave Desert.  Neso soils have 10 to 20 percent clay, are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June, and occur in the Great Plains.  Infantry, Sutherland, and Sequite soils are inactive."
