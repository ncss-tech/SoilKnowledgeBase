  "OVERVIEW": "The Pittman series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to a lime-cemented hardpan.  They formed in alluvium from mostly igneous rock sources on erosional fan remnants and nonburied fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F.; and the mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches.",
