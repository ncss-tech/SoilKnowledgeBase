No data was changed.\nDiagnostic features and horizons recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches) (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 18 to 61 centimeters (7 to 24 inches) Btss1 and Btss2 horizons)\nSlickensides - presence of slickensides in the zone from 18 to 61 centimeters (7 to 24 inches) (Btss1 and Btss2 horizons)\nParalithic contact - the occurrence of weathered bedrock at a depth of 91 centimeters (36 inches) (upper boundary of the Cr horizon).\nLithic contact - the occurrence of hard bedrock at a depth of 132 centimeters (52 inches) (upper boundary of the R horizon)\nVertic feature: cracks within 127 centimeters (50 inches) that are 5 mm or more wide through a thickness of 30 centimeters (12 inches) or more for some time in normal years, and slickensides or wedge-shaped aggregates in a layer 15 centimeters (6 inches) or more thick that has its upper boundary within 127 centimeters (50 inches) of the soil surface; or a linear extensibility of 2.5 inches or more between the surface and either a depth of 102 centimeters (40 inches) or a paralithic contact, whichever is shallower\nOxyaquic feature: Saturation with water in one or more layers within 102 centimeters (40 inches) of the surface in normal years for either or both 20 or more consecutive days or 30 or more cumulative days."
