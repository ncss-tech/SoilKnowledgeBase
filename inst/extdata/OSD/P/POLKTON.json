  "OVERVIEW": "The Polkton series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils on uplands of the Triassic Basins in the Southern Piedmont. They formed in residuum weathered from Triassic siltstone, mudstone, shale, and sandstone. Slope ranges from 2 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F. near the type location.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to weathered bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. Depth to hard bedrock is 40 to 60 inches or more. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent by volume. Linear extensibility totals 6.0 cm or more between the surface and paralithic contact. Nonintersecting slickensides range from few to common in the Btss horizon. Base saturation by sum of cations increases with depth and ranges from 35 to 60 percent immediately above the paralithic contact. Exchangeable aluminum content of the Btss horizon is high (10 to 25 me/100g). The soil is very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A, Ap, and E horizons, and very strongly acid or strongly acid in the Btss, Bt, BC and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay. Where uneroded, it is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is clay loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon, if it occurs, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Iron depletions in shades of yellow and brown range from none to many. Texture is clay, silty clay, or sandy clay.\nThe Btss horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Iron depletions in shades of yellow and brown range from none to many. Iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less are below the upper 10 inches of the Btss horizon and within a depth of 40 inches. Texture is clay, silty clay, or sandy clay.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Some pedons have masses of iron accumulation in shades of red, brown, or yellow, or iron depletions in shades of brown, yellow, or gray. Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 8. Pedons may be mottled in shades of these colors or contain mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray. Texture is variable and ranges from sandy loam to clay saprolite.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered Triassic siltstone, mudstone, shale, sandstone, or conglomerate.\nThe R horizon is hard Triassic siltstone, mudstone, shale, sandstone, or conglomerate."

The moderately well drained to somewhat poorly drained Creedmoor soils do not have vertic properties, and are on lower concave positions and adjacent to natural drainageways. The somewhat poorly drained Green Level soils do not have a depth to bedrock within 60 inches and have a base saturation of less than 35 percent. The well drained Mayodan soils do not have vertic properties and are on side slopes and gently sloping ridges.  The well drained Peakin soils do not have vertic properties and have a perched water table at 3 to 6 feet.  The well drained Pinoka soils have a loamy subsoil and are on similar landscape positions. White Store soils are on similar landscape positions."
