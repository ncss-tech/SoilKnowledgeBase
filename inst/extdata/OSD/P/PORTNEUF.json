Bahem soils have less than 15 percent durinodes, and are less compact in the Bk horizon.  Darkbull soils have a loamy-skeletal control section.  Declo soils have a coarse-loamy control section.  Heglar soils have a xeric moisture regime.  Kimama soils have a mollic epipedon.  Minidoka, Scism, and Sluka soils have duripans.  Pocatello and Wheeler soils lack calcic horizons.  Portino and Trevino soils have bedrock at less than 40 inches and less than 20 inches respectively.  Bahem, Darkbull, Declo, Kimama, Minidoka, Pocatello, Portino, Scism, Sluka, and Trevino soils are on basalt plains and fan terraces.  Heglar soils are on high fan terraces and hillsides.  Wheeler soils are on steep hillsides."
