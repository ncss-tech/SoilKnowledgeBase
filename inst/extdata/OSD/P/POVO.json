  "OVERVIEW": "The Povo series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountain side slopes and ridges.  They formed in loess over colluvium and/or residuum from rhyolite and dacite of the Potato Hill Volcanics that is blanketed by a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Slope ranges from 5 to 55 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 5 degrees C. and the average annual precipitation is about 915 mm.",
