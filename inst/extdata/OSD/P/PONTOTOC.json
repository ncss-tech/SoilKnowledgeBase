  "OVERVIEW": "The Pontotoc series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in thick beds of red Cambrian age sandstone bedrock. These soils occur on nearly level to moderately sloping footslopes of ridges on dissected plateaus. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 in), and the mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (66 degrees F).",
