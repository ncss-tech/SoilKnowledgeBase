  "OVERVIEW": "The Penitente series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from granite, gneiss, and schist.  Penitente soils are on mountain tops above timberline and have slopes of 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 30 degrees F.",

The solum ranges from 16 to 26 inches thick.  The solum is very strongly acid or strongly acid (pH 4.4 or 5.5).  The mean annual soil temperature is less than 32 degrees F.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of neutral through 2.\nThe B2ir horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is typically sandy loam but ranges from 5 to 25 percent, in silt from 10 to 40 percent, and in sand from 40 to 75 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.  Its texture is similar to that of the B horizon.  It is very strongly to medium acid (pH 4.6 to 5.8)."
