  "OVERVIEW": "The Penitente series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from granite, gneiss, and schist.  Penitente soils are on mountain tops above timberline and have slopes of 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1200 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about minus 1 degrees C.",
