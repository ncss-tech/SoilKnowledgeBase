The solum ranges from 16 to 26 inches thick.  The solum is very strongly acid or strongly acid (pH 4.4 or 5.5).  The mean annual soil temperature is less than 32 degrees F.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of neutral through 2.\nThe B2ir horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is typically sandy loam but ranges from 5 to 25 percent, in silt from 10 to 40 percent, and in sand from 40 to 75 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.  Its texture is similar to that of the B horizon.  It is very strongly to medium acid (pH 4.6 to 5.8)."

Buell, Goodlow, Gramm and Hummington soils have a mean annual soil temperature above 32 degrees F.  Meredith soils have fragmental substrata.  Mirror and Ptarmigan soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Ptarmigan soils are nonskeletal."

They formed in material consisting mostly of granite, gneiss and schist.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 55 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 28 to 30 degrees F.  The frost free season is 30 to 50 days."
