  "OVERVIEW": "The Powellton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in weathered tephra over residuum and colluvium from metadiorite, metavolcanic rocks, gabbro and diorite.  Powellton soils are on ridge tops and side slopes on metamorphic Sierra Nevada mountains.  Slopes range from 2 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 71 inches, (1803 mm).  The mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F, (12 degrees C).",
