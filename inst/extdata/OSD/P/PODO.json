  "OVERVIEW": "The Podo series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium, residuum and colluvium from sedimentary rocks. Podo soils occur on structural benches, ledges on escarpments, ridge tops, hills, and mountain slopes. Slopes are 3 to 70 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
