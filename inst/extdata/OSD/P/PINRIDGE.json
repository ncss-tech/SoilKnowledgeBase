  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinridge series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  Pinridge soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 62 to 64 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is moist in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days immediately following April and dry in all parts for 60 or more consecutive days immediately following July 1.  Depth to secondary calcium carbonate ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  The horizons above the zone of secondary lime accumulation are noneffervescent or slightly effervescent.  The mollic epipedon is 16 to 25 inches thick.  The particle-size control section is generally free of rock fragments, but thin strata containing up to 15 percent pebbles may occur in some pedons.\nThe A horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It is sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bk2 or Bk3 horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam.  Thin strata of loamy sand may occur in some pedons."
