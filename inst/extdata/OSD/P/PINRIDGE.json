    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 62 to 64 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is moist in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days immediately following April and dry in all parts for 60 or more consecutive days immediately following July 1.  Depth to secondary calcium carbonate ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  The horizons above the zone of secondary lime accumulation are noneffervescent or slightly effervescent.  The mollic epipedon is 16 to 25 inches thick.  The particle-size control section is generally free of rock fragments, but thin strata containing up to 15 percent pebbles may occur in some pedons.\nThe A horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It is sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bk2 or Bk3 horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam.  Thin strata of loamy sand may occur in some pedons."

The Brycan soil has a cambic horizon.  Cordeston, Dalecreek, and Frolic soils are noncalcareous above a depth of 40 inches.  In addition, Dalecreek soils are moderately well drained.  Enbar, Jodero, Nutrioso, and Straw soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section for some period immediately after July 1.  McGaffey soils have hues of 7.5YR or redder."
