  "OVERVIEW": "The Picketlake series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or alluvium derived from conglomerate.  These soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.",
