  "OVERVIEW": "The Palix series consists of deep, well drained, soils that formed in colluvium  and residuum from bedrock of siltstone, sandstone and conglomerate lithologies. Palix soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 8 to 90 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 80 to 120 inches.",

Calawah, Ilwaco, Lint, Newskah, Queets and Salander soils are very deep. Knappton soils are over 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Bullman and Neotsu soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact. Neskowin soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact. Knappton soils have developed over basalt and coarse fragments are lithic. Lytell soils are very similar and review is needed for series separation. Narel soils have 20 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section but more review is needed for adequate series separation."
