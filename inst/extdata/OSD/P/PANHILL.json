  "OVERVIEW": "The Panhill series is a member of a fine-silty, mixed, thermic family or Mollic Haplargids. The soils have light brownish gray, mildly alkaline, silty clay loam A horizons; brown, slightly alkaline, silty clay loam Bt horizons; yellowish brown, strongly calcareous upper C horizons and stratified calcareous lower C horizons.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils have ochric epipedons argillic horizons, are dry for more than 60 consecutive days in all parts from 10 to 40 inches, have soil temperatures greater than 59 degrees F., and are of mixed mineralogy. The solum is 16 to 24 inches thick and depth to stratified layers is about 26 to 39 inches. There may be some gravels throughout the profile.\nThe A horizons have weak to strong structure and slightly hard to very hard consistencies. The A horizons range in color from light brownish gray, pale brown, brown to yellowish brown in 10YR and 2.5YR hues with values of 5 to 6 and chromas of 2 to 4; in texture from silty clay loam to fine sandy loam; in reaction from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon ranges in color from brown to yellowish brown in 10YR hue; in texture from loam to silty clay loam; reaction from mildly to moderately alkaline and they may or may not be calcareous. The B horizons have minimal development with slight increase in clay from A to B and few to common clay films on ped faces and in pores. Structure is weak blocky and consistence is slightly hard to very hard.\nThe upper C horizons are yellowish brown or light yellowish brown silty clay loams or loams which may be underlain by stratified sandy loam to silt loam, which may be gravelly to very gravelly."

They occur at elevations of 200 to 2000 feet, in a semiarid mesothermal climate with mean annual rainfall of 6 to 12 inches, with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F., average January temperature about 46 degrees F., and average July temperature about 83 degrees F. Frost-free season averages about 256 days."
