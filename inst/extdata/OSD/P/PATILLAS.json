  "OVERVIEW": "The Patillas series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on dissected uplands.  They formed in residuum of intrusive plutonic rocks.  Slopes range from 20 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 65 inches and the mean annual temperatue is about 79 degrees F.",

Reaction is strongly or very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silty clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is silty clay loam or clay loam.  Structure is weak fine through coarse subangular blocky.  Clay films range from few faint to many prominent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture ranges from sandy loam through loamy sand."

The Alonoso, Consumo, Corozal, Ingenio, Lirios, Maricao, Moca, and Rio Piedras soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section, and with the exception of Maricao and Consumo, have Bt horizons more than 16 inches thick.  The Jagueyes soils have CEC less than 24 meq/100 grams of clay and Bt horizons more than 16 inches thick.  The Pandura soils lack Bt horizons."

The regolith is weathered residuum of intrusive plutonic rocks, mainly quartz diorite and grandiorite.  The climate is humid tropical.  The mean annual rainfall is 60 to 70 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 78 to 80 degrees F."
