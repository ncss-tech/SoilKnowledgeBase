These soils formed in recent volcanic mud flow deposits and alluvium.  Pierking soils are in a marine climate with cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 60 to 80 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 33 degrees F and the mean July temperature is about 59 degrees F; the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 160 days."
