  "OVERVIEW": "The Pickett series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium from glacial drift, metasedimentary bedrock, and volcanic ash. Pickett soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slope ranges from 5 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1,015 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",

Lydon soils formed in weathered tephra over residuum and colluvium weathered from igneous rock, have a mean annual soil temperature ranging from 11 to 15 degrees C, and are dry in the soil moisture control section for more than 60 days. Lyre soils formed in glacial outwash and are very deep. McElroy soils are very deep, have an umbric epipedon, and formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt. Ovall soils formed in glacial drift mixed with residuum and colluvium from andesite and breccia, and have an umbric epipedon. Schneider and Siouxon soils are 100 to 150 cm deep to a lithic contact and have an umbric epipedon. Yedlick soils do not have a lithic contact, are formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt, and are dry in the soil moisture control section for 60 to 75 days."
