Lydon soils formed in weathered tephra over residuum and colluvium weathered from igneous rock, have a mean annual soil temperature ranging from 11 to 15 degrees C, and are dry in the soil moisture control section for more than 60 days. Lyre soils formed in glacial outwash and are very deep. McElroy soils are very deep, have an umbric epipedon, and formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt. Ovall soils formed in glacial drift mixed with residuum and colluvium from andesite and breccia, and have an umbric epipedon. Schneider and Siouxon soils are 100 to 150 cm deep to a lithic contact and have an umbric epipedon. Yedlick soils do not have a lithic contact, are formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt, and are dry in the soil moisture control section for 60 to 75 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pickett soils occur on hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent and elevations range from 0 to 732 meters. These soils formed in colluvium from glacial drift, bedrock of metasedimentary lithology, and volcanic ash. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, moist winters with intermittent snow cover. The annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 1,140 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 9 degrees C. The frost-free season is 160 to 220 days."

Skipjack soils do not have a lithic contact, have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, and occur on adjacent hillslopes and mountain slopes. Kickerville soils formed in loess and glacial outwash, do not have a lithic contact, and occur on outwash terraces."
