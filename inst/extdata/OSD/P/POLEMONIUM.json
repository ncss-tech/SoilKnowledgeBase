  "OVERVIEW": "The Polemonium series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in slope alluvium over residuum weathered from granitic rocks. The Polemonium soils are on mesas and tops of mountains of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 820 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 0 degrees C.",
