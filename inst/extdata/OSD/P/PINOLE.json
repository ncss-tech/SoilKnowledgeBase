  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinole series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium weathered from sedimentary  and other rock sources.  Pinole soils are on terraces and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F.",
