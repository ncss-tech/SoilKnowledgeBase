  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in mixed alluvium, residuum and eolian material derived dominantly from sandstone, conglomerate and limestone. Mean annual air temperature is 49 to 55 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 8 to 14 inches. The precipitation is distributed evenly throughout the year with a slight bulge in July, August, September and October. The driest months are April, May and June. The freeze-free period is about 140 to 180 days."
