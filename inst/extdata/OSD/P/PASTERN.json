  "OVERVIEW": "The Pastern series consists of very shallow and shallow over hardpan, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in mixed alluvium and eolian material derived dominantly from sandstone, conglomerate and limestone. Pastern soils are on pediments, fan terraces and structural benches, and have slopes of 2 to 20 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
