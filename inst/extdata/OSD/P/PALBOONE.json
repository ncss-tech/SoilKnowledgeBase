  "OVERVIEW": "The Palboone series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed schist, gneiss, and/or granite.  Palboone soils are on mountainsides and ridges.  Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

These soils are noncalcareous to a depth of more than 40 inches.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent.  Depth to the top of the argillic horizon is less than 27 inches.  Rock fragments average 5 to 20 percent in the 10 to 40 inch section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  It ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 4 through 6.  It ranges from medium acid to neutral.   It is typically sandy loam and averages 11 to 16 percent clay, 16 to 29 percent silt, and 58 to 73 percent sand.\nThe Cr horizon if present, is below depths of 40 inches and is mixed schist, gneiss, and granite."
