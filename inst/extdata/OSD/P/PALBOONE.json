  "OVERVIEW": "The Palboone series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed schist, gneiss, and/or granite.  Palboone soils are on mountainsides and ridges.  Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",

The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.\nPalboone soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic soil moisture regime.\nConverted to metric and O horizons were updated to start at zero.
