  "OVERVIEW": "The Pacific Mesa series consists of shallow to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from andesite and basalt. Pacific Mesa soils are on mountains and slopes range from 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 66 degrees F.",
