The soils are not usually dry, but are dry in the 7 to 20 inches depth for more than 45 consecutive days.\nThese soils contain 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate throughout. Mollic epipedons are less than 20 inches thick. Clay minerals are mixed but dominantly montmorillonitic. The soils are moderately or strongly alkaline and moderately or strongly calcareous.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, and 4 or 5 dry. It is loam or silty clay loam. The 10 to 40 inch section has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4 moist and 4 through 6 dry. It is silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam with more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand and less than 18 percent clay.\nThe C horizon below about 40 inches has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3.5 through 5 moist, 5.5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silty clay loam to loamy sand, but very fine sandy loam or loams are dominant."
