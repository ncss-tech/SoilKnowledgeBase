  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Perwick series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from tuffaceous sediments, consolidated lake sediments and siltstone.  Perwick soils are on dissected low hills.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
