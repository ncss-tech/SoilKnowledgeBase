  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pitchdraw soils consist of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium or eolian deposits over residuum or residuum derived from soft sandstone. They are on bedrock-controlled hillslopes and ridges. Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
