Kokohahi soils have 2.5Y or yellower hue below the A horizon, and have chroma of 1 in the upper 12 inches.  Lualualei soils have horizons high in gypsum at a depth of less than 40 inches.  Makalapa soils formed in volcanic tuff and are strongly calcareous below a depth of 20 inches.  Nonopahu soils have kaolinitic mineralogy and have moist value of 4 or more in the upper 12 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Papaa soils are on uplands at elevations from near sea level to 500 feet.  Slopes range from 6 to 70 percent.  The dominant slopes are between 35 and 70 percent; smaller areas have gently rolling to hilly topography.  Papaa soils formed in residuum weathered from basalt and colluvium.  Annual rainfall is 30 to 45 inches, most of which falls during the winter.  Mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F., average January temperature is 71 degrees F., and average July temperature is 76 degrees F."
