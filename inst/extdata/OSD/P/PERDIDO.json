Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy fine sand.  It is 4 to 9 inches thick.\nSome pedons have an EB or BE horizon that has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.
