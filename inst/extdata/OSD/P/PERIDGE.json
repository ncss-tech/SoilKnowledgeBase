  "OVERVIEW": "The Peridge series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from interbedded limestone, sandstone and shale.  These soils are on nearly level to moderately steep, broad uplands in the Ozarks of Arkansas and Missouri.  Slopes are dominantly less than 8 percent, but range to 20 percent.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees.",

Baylis, Crider, Ryker, Stinesville, and Winnipeg soils soils formed in loess over residuum or glacial drift.  These soils typically contain less sand above the discontinuity.  In addition, they have hues of 7.5YR or browner in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Hootentown soils formed in alluvium.  They and do not contain a discontinuity and typically have browner hues in the upper part of the argillic horizon."

Peridge soils formed in colluvium and residuum from interbedded limestones, sandstones and shales of the Pitkin, Fayetteville, Weddington, Batesville and Hindsville Formations in northern Arkansas and their counterparts in southern Missouri.  These formations are not continuous and only outcrop along the Boston Mountain escarpment and as isolated remnants over the Boone Formation that makes up the Springfield Plateau in Arkansas.  Peridge soils dominantly occur on these isolated remnants on the Springfield Plateau."
