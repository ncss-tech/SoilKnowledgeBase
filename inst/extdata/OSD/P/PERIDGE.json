Coarse fragments range from 0 to 9 percent in the A, BA, AB and Bt horizons and from 0 to 60 percent in the 2Bt horizon and below. The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 56 to 59 degrees F..\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4; or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4.  Some pedons have an A horizon 4 to 6 inches thick with hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or 3; or with hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam.\nSome pedons have BA or AB horizons, 2 to 8 inches thick, that have hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6; or hue of 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Baylis, Crider, Hootentown, Ryker, Stinesville, and Winnipeg series.  Baylis, Crider, Ryker, Stinesville, and Winnipeg soils soils formed in loess over residuum or glacial drift.  These soils typically contain less sand above the discontinuity.  In addition, they have hues of 7.5YR or browner in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Hootentown soils formed in alluvium.  They and do not contain a discontinuity and typically have browner hues in the upper part of the argillic horizon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Peridge soils are on nearly level to moderately steep, broad uplands.  Slopes are dominantly 1 to 8 percent, but range to 20 percent.  Peridge soils formed in colluvium and residuum from interbedded limestones, sandstones and shales of the Pitkin, Fayetteville, Weddington, Batesville and Hindsville Formations in northern Arkansas and their counterparts in southern Missouri.  These formations are not continuous and only outcrop along the Boston Mountain escarpment and as isolated remnants over the Boone Formation that makes up the Springfield Plateau in Arkansas.  Peridge soils dominantly occur on these isolated remnants on the Springfield Plateau."

These soils typically occur on the Springfield Plateau and should be at slightly lower elevations. Captina, Nixa, and Tonti soils contain a fragipan.  Clarksville soils are in a loamy-skeletal family and Noark soils are in a clayey-skeletal family."
