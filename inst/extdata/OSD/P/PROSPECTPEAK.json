Mean annual precipitation is 31 to 43 inches (787 to 1092 mm). The mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F (6 degrees C). Frost free season is 50 to 90 days."

The Bearrubble soils are very deep and have more stones and boulders at the surface and in the upper profile due to a thinner mantle of tephra on the surface. The Buttelake soils are deep to dense till and are on moraines that are covered with a mantle of tephra from Cinder Cone. The Badgerflat soils are moderately deep to dense till and are on moraines with a mantle of tephra from Chaos Crags."
