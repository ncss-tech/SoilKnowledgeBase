  "OVERVIEW": "The Prospectpeak series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in tephra over residuum from andesite. Prospectpeak soils are on shield volcanoes in the Southern Cascade mountains. Slopes range from 10 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches (838 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F (6 degrees C).",

The Bearrubble soils are very deep and have more stones and boulders at the surface and in the upper profile due to a thinner mantle of tephra on the surface.
