  "OVERVIEW": "The Pahreah series consists of well drained, moderately permeable soils that are moderately deep to limestone.  They formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from limestone.  Slopes range from 1 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 22 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

The depth to consolidated bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 90 percent in the particle size control section.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 36 to 42 degrees F.  and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 54 to 57 degrees F.  The A horizon is noncalcareous or slightly calcareous and lime increases with increasing depth to very strongly calcareous in the Bk horizon.  Carbonates are estimated to average 40 to 60 percent thoughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It ranges from gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly and very cobbly loam to very gravelly clay loam.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 8.  It ranges from very gravelly, very cobbly, extremely gravelly and extremely cobbly loam to extremely gravelly and cobbly silt loam."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly classified as loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, shallow Typic Cryoborolls, but they do not have a paralithic contactiwithin 20 inches as required for the shallow family.  In addition, they have a calcic horizon immediately under the mollic epipedon placing them in the calcic subgroup.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 9 inches (A1, A2, Bw horizons)\nCalcic horizon - the zone from about 9 to 38 inches (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3, Bk4 horizons)"
