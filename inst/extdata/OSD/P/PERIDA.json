    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the sandy mantle ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy mantle and 0 to 5 percent in the sandy substratum.  Rock fragments typically are absent in the clayey deposits.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to neutral in the sandy upper sola.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly alkaline in the lower clayey sola, and very strongly acid to neutral in the sandy substratum.  Redoxamorphic accumulations occur within 72 inches and are slightly above 40 inches in some pedons.  Saturation occurs at 40 to 72 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is sand or loamy sand.\nSome uncultivated pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand.\nThe Bw horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand.\nThe 2Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Typically it is clay, but individual subhorizons of silty clay, silty clay loam, clay loam or silt loam are in some pedons.  The weighted average clay content of the argillic horizon ranges from 50 to 80 percent.  The clay fraction is dominantly smectite.\nSome pedons have a 2Btg horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 1 or 2.  It has texture like the 2Bt horizon above.\nThe 3BC horizon (where present) has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sand or loamy sand.\nThe 3C has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Perida soils are on lake plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Perida soils formed in a mantle of sandy outwash or sandy lacustrine deposits over clayey lacustrine deposits underlain by sandy outwash or sandy lacustrine deposits on lake plains or outwash plains.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 27 to 29 inches.  The frost free period is estimated to range from 110 to 130 days.  Elevation ranges from 960 to 1100 feet."

The poorly drained Dody soils, the somewhat poorly drained Meenon soils, and the moderately well drained Karlsborg soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where the sandy mantle is 20 to 40 inches thick over clayey lacustrine deposits.  The moderately well drained Grettum soils have lamellae and do not have the clayey layer."

Permeability is rapid in the sandy mantle, very slow to  slow in the clayey deposits, and rapid in the sandy substratum.  Perida soils have a perched seasonal water table at depths of 4 to 6 feet at some time during the months of October to May."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of this soil are used for woodland.  Common trees are red pine, jack pine, and northern pin oak. Some areas are used for cropland.  Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay.  Many areas which were used for cropland are no longer being farmed and are reverting to native vegetation."
