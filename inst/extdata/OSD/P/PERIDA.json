  "OVERVIEW": "The Perida series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in a mantle of sandy outwash or sandy lacustrine deposits over clayey lacustrine deposits underlain by sandy outwash or sandy lacustrine deposits on lake plains or outwash plains.  Permeability is rapid in the sandy mantle, very slow to slow in the clayey lacustrine deposits, and rapid in the sandy substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy mantle and 0 to 5 percent in the sandy substratum.  Rock fragments typically are absent in the clayey deposits.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to neutral in the sandy upper sola.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly alkaline in the lower clayey sola, and very strongly acid to neutral in the sandy substratum.  Redoxamorphic accumulations occur within 72 inches and are slightly above 40 inches in some pedons.  Saturation occurs at 40 to 72 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is sand or loamy sand.\nSome uncultivated pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand.\nThe Bw horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand.\nThe 2Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Typically it is clay, but individual subhorizons of silty clay, silty clay loam, clay loam or silt loam are in some pedons.  The weighted average clay content of the argillic horizon ranges from 50 to 80 percent.  The clay fraction is dominantly smectite.\nSome pedons have a 2Btg horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 1 or 2.  It has texture like the 2Bt horizon above.\nThe 3BC horizon (where present) has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sand or loamy sand.\nThe 3C has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is sand."
