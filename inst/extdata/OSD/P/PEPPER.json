  "OVERVIEW": "The Pepper series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly or very slowly permeable soils on broad areas in the flatwoods of Peninsular Florida.  They formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is 74 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Total thickness of the A and E horizons is less than 30 inches.  Depth to the Btg horizon is more than 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the A, E, and BE horizons, from extremely acid to slightly acid in the Bh horizons, and from strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the Btg and Cg horizons.  The more acid reactions in the Btg horizons are due to the presence of pyrites and cannot be predicted.\nWhen rubbed, the A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  If the value is 3.5 or less, thickness is less than 8 inches.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe BE horizon, where present, is between the E and the Bh horizon.  It has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2 with many uncoated sand grains.  Thickness ranges up to 3 inches.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4; or it is neutral with value of 2.  It is weakly or moderately cemented in 60 to 90 percent of the horizon.  Some pedons have a lower Bh horizon that is noncemented and have the same range of colors and textures.  Thickness is variable within short distances, ranging from about 6 to 36 inches or more thick.  Streaks or pockets of uncoated sand range from none to common.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nSome pedons contain E', BE', OR B/E horizons between the Bh and Btg horizon.  Where present, they have the same range of colors and textures as the E and BE horizons.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, chroma 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 4 or 6.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, and gray range from none to common.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5BG, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 or 6.  Redoximorphic features in shards of brown, yellow, and gray range from none to common.  Texture is variable, ranging from sand to sandy clay loam and may be stratified."

The very poorly or poorly drained Ankona, Immokalee, Myakka, Nettles, Oldsmar, and Waveland soils are on similar to lower positions and have spodic horizons at depths between 30 and 50 inches.  In addition, Immokalee and Myakka soils are not in the ortstein family and do not have argillic horizons below the spodic horizon, Oldsmar soils are not in the ortstein family, and Waveland soils do not have argillic horizons below the spodic horizons.  The very poorly drained Basinger soils are in lower positions, have weakly expressed spodic horizons, and are sandy throughout.  The somewhat poorly to moderately well drained Jonathan and Pomello soils are on higher positions.  In addition, Jonathan soils have spodic horizons below 50 inches and lack argillic horizons below the spodic horizons while Pomello soils are not in the ortstein family.  Lawnwood soils are on similar positions and do not have argillic horizons below the spodic horizons.  The very poorly to poorly drained Malabar and Pineda soils are on lower positions and do not have spodic horizons.  In addition, Malabar soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches in thickness while Pineda soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness and are Glossic.  The moderately well drained Pendarvis soils are on similar to higher positions, have spodic horizons at a depth of 30 to 50 inches, and do not have argillic horizons below the spodic horizons.  Salerno soils are on similar to higher positions, have spodic horizons below depths of 50 inches, and lack argillic horizons.  The excessively well drained St. Lucie soils are on higher positions and are sandy throughout.  Wauchula soils are on similar positions but are not in the ortstein family."

It is perched above the spodic horizon early in the summer rainy season and after heavy rainfall in other seasons.  During extended low rainfall periods, the water table recedes to below a depth of 40 inches.\nPepper soils were included in the EauGallie series.  In situ saturated hydraulic conductivity rates of 13 tests at 5 sites show permeability to range from 0.2012 to 0.0012 in/hr.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
