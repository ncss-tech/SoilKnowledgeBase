  "OVERVIEW": "The Prewitt series consists of moderately dark colored, well drained, calcareous alluvial soils developing on flood plains and low terraces in stratified, but predominantly moderately fine textured, calcareous alluvium.  The parent materials are mixed alluvium consisting mainly of sediments from redbeds of Jurassic, Triassic, and Permian Age but containing minor amount of materials washed from Cretaceous sedimentary deposits.  Prewitt soils occur in areas having average annual precipitation ranging from about 12 to 18 inches, with mean annual temperatures of about 57 degrees F. They normally have an A1 - AC - C horizon sequence with moderately dark colored A1 horizons and weak or no horizon of lime accumulation.  The Prewitt soils are of moderately fine texture, as compared to medium textures of the San Jose series.  Prewitt soils have darker surface horizons than Tours soils and are coarser textured than Ladrillo soils.",

Salt content of the lower subsoil horizons ranges from none to moderate, and some salt may occur at any depth.  Color of the A horizon may range in hue from 2.5YR to 7.5YR, in chroma from 1.5 to 3, and in value from 4 to 5.5.  Color values of the moist A horizon range from 2 to 3.5.  Hue of the C horizon may range from 2.5YR to 2.5Y with hues as red or redder than 7.5YR predominating."
