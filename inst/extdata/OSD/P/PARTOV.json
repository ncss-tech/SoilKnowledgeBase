  "OVERVIEW": "The Partov series consists of shallow, well-drained soils formed in volcanic ash, cinders, and fragmented basalt. Partov soils are on ridges and knolls of hilly uplands and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 55 to 65 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Pyramid series of the same subgroup, and the Aslik, Okmok, and Tolstoi series. The Pyramid soils have a layer of recent volcanic ash at the surface and have less than 35 percent (by volume) of coarse fragments in the upper part of the soil. The Aslik soils have a substratum of cindery materials. The Okmok soils are dominantly monthixotropic and are 20 to 40 inches thick over bedrock.  The Tolstoi soils are very strongly acid and have a spodic horizon."

They formed in volcanic ash, cinders, and fragmented basalt. Elevations range from 200 to 3000 feet. The climate is maritime, with cool summers and mild winters. The mean annual precipitation is 55 to 65 inches The mean annual air temperature is 41 degrees F, the mean January temperature is 33 degrees F.; the mean July air temperature is 52 derees F.; and the average growing season is 145 days."
