  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the umbric epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches, thickness of solum ranges from 15 to 30 inches, and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The fine earth fraction of the control section is typically sandy loam but averages 3 to 18 percent, 10 to 40 percent silt, and 50 to 80 percent sand.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent in the majority of the control section.  The soils are extremely acid or strongly acid.  The estimated average soil temperature is 28 to 32 degrees F., and the estimated average summer soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The moisture control section is dry for 60 to 90 days cumulative and is dry for 30 to 45 consecutive days in the summer.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 2 through 5 dry, 1 through 3 moist, and chroma of 0 through 2.  The horizon is less than 50 percent base saturated.  Organic carbon ranges from 2 to 20 percent.  Typically this soil has strong granular structure but it has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  It is soft or slightly hard.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Typically this horizon has weak to moderate fine subangular blocky structure, but structure varies in both grade and class.  Dry consistence is slightly hard to hard.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR."

The soils formed in material weathered residually or locally transported from gneiss and schist or similar bedrock. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 35 inches, most of which comes as snow.  The average annual temperature is 28 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 40 degrees F."
