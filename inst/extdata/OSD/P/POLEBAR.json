Textures are loam, gravelly loam and gravelly clay loam; structure is weak to moderate, medium to coarse subangalar blocky; consistence is hard or\nSlightly hard, friable, slightly plastic and slightly sticky to plastic and\nsticky, and reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizons have colors with 5YR and 7.5YR hues in the B2t and 10YR and 2.5Y in the B3t. Chromas are 3 to 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist. The B3t is mottled. Textures are gravelly clay or gravelly heavy clay loam; structure is moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky consistence is very hard, firm, very plastic and very sticky. Reaction is slightly acid to neutral in the B2t and neutral to mildly alkaline in the B3t.\nThe Cca horizon has hues of 2.5Y and 5Y with values of 5 or 6 dry and 4 moist. The texture is gravelly light clay or gravelly clay loan and structure is subangalar blocky. Consistence is hard to very hard, firm and sticky to very sticky.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Polebar soils occur on hilly to very steep uplands on hard sedimentary and metasedimentary rock. They occur at elevations of 20W to\n3500 feet, in a subhumid mesothermal climate with mean annual rainfall of 25\nto 40 inches with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual\ntemperature is about 56 degrees F., average January temperature about 40\ndegrees F., and average July temperature about 71 degrees F. Frost-free season averages about 120 to 150 days."
