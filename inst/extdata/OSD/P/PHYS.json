These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the summer and early fall. The solum is 14 to 28 inches thick. The mollic epipedon is 12 to 20 inches thick. Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It is gravelly silt loam, silt loam, or cobbly loam with 18 to 27 percent clay. It has 0 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones. Cobbles and stones have been removed from cultivated areas. Soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is very cobbly clay loam or cobbly loam and averages 20 to 30 percent clay. It has 10 to 25 percent gravel, 10 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones. Soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. It is clay loam and averages 27 to 35 percent clay. It has 35 to 60 percent rock fragments of which 10 to 40 percent are gravel, 20 to 35 percent are cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent are stones. Soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has color similar to the Bt horizon. It is loam or sandy clay loam with 15 to 25 percent clay. It has 50 to 80 percent rock fragments of which 10 to 30 percent are gravel, 20 to 50 percent are cobbles, and 0 to 20 percent are stones. In some pedons, secondary carbonates may occur below 44 inches. Soil reaction is slightly acid or slightly alkaline."

All of these series are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact except for Badge, Collard, Dixiejett and Kusshi. Badge soils are dry for 90 to 105 days. Collard soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 49 degrees F and have a very cobbly loamy sand substratum with less than 10 percent clay. Dixiejett soils are 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact. Kusshi soils have an O horizon.  Garloaf soils are not in the database and cannot be competed."
