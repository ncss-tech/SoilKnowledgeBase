  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinata series is a member of the clayey, skeletal, mixed family of Typic Paleustalfs.  Typically, Pinata soils have stony very dark grayish brown surface horizons over stony, reddish brown Bt horizons.  Partially weathered hard bedrock is at depths of 40 and 72 inches below the surface.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 72 inches.  The solum is slightly acid to neutral (pH 6.1 to 7.3).  It ranges from 30 to 50 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from an estimated 40 to 45 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is about 67 degrees F.  The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam and contains 15 to 40 percent coarse fragments, most of which are stones.  The E horizon is similar to the A horizon except that the E horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry and 4 through 6 moist. The Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is heavy clay loam, clay or sandy clay modified by stones that make up 40 to 80 percent of the horizon.  Fragments are dominantly stones but range through gravel.  C horizons are in some pedons."

Etown soils have argillic horizons with their upper boundary at depths greater than 24 inches below the mineral surface.  Nutras and Loberg soils have a cryic temperature regime, and in addition, Loberg soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy."

The soils formed mostly in residuum weathered from felsite and minor amounts of limestone and sandstone.  The mean annual temperature is 40 degrees F. and the annual precipitation is about 27 inches."

Erramouspe soils have mesic temperature regimes.  Fortwingate soils lack skeletal control sections.  Stroupe and Tampico soils have a mollic epipedon.  Telcolote soils have a loamy, skeletal control section."
