  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 72 inches.  The solum is slightly acid to neutral (pH 6.1 to 7.3).  It ranges from 30 to 50 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from an estimated 40 to 45 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is about 67 degrees F.  The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam and contains 15 to 40 percent coarse fragments, most of which are stones.  The E horizon is similar to the A horizon except that the E horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry and 4 through 6 moist. The Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is heavy clay loam, clay or sandy clay modified by stones that make up 40 to 80 percent of the horizon.  Fragments are dominantly stones but range through gravel.  C horizons are in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Borrego, Crest, Etown, Nutras, and Loberg series.  Borrego soils have bedrock within 20 inches of the surface.  Etown soils have argillic horizons with their upper boundary at depths greater than 24 inches below the mineral surface.  Nutras and Loberg soils have a cryic temperature regime, and in addition, Loberg soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pinata soils are on strongly to very steep side slopes of mountains where the elevation ranges from 6,800 to 8,800 feet.  Slopes are 1 to 60 percent.  The soils formed mostly in residuum weathered from felsite and minor amounts of limestone and sandstone.  The mean annual temperature is 40 degrees F. and the annual precipitation is about 27 inches."

Erramouspe soils have mesic temperature regimes.  Fortwingate soils lack skeletal control sections.  Stroupe and Tampico soils have a mollic epipedon.  Telcolote soils have a loamy, skeletal control section."
