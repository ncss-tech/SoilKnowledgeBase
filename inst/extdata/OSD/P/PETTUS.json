  "REVDATE": "04/2009",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pettus series consists of very deep deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous loamy sediments of Pleistocene and Pliocene ages. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils are on shoulders on hillslopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).",
