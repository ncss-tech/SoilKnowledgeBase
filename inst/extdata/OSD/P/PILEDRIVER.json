    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to sand and gravel ranges from 20 to 40 inches (50 to 102 cm). Organic carbon content decreases irregularly with depth. The texture of the upper part of the control section is stratified silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam and very fine sand with a weighted average of more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser and less than 18 percent clay. This material contains significant amounts of mica but less than 25 percent. Texture of the lower part of the control section is sand or loamy sand with coarse fragments ranging from 0 to 70 percent.\nThe O horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 2, 2.5 or 3; and chroma of 1 to 3. Organic material is slightly to strongly decomposed, and reaction ranges from extremely to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y and 5Y; value of 3 to 5; and chroma 2 and 3. These horizons are stratified with textures including very fine sandy loam, silt loam, loamy very fine sand and loamy fine sand. Profiles may have stratified black organic material from 2 to 15 percent. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y and 5Y; value of 3 to 5; and chroma 2 and 3. Texture is sand or loamy sand. Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 70 percent, with 0 to 70 percent gravel and 0 to15 percent cobble."
