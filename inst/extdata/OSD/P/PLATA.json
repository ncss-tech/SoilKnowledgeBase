Reaction ranges from strongly to very strongly acid throughout.  Base saturation of the epipedon and cambic horizon is 50 percent or more.  Exchange capacity is more than 20 meg/100 grams of clay.  Texture of the control section averages gravelly clay loam with less than 35 percent clay and more than 35 percent by volume of medium and coarse gravel.  These soils have slightly sticky and plastic solum and slightly sticky and slightly plastic C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 and 4 and chroma of 4.  Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 and 5 and chroma of 4 and 6.  Texture is clay loam or clay\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon has texture and color similar to the BC horizon."

The Cuchillas soils have soil temperatures below 71.6 degrees F at depth of 20 inches and lack the coarse fragments in their profiles. The Quebrada and Morado soils are less acid and lack the gravelly horizons.  The Maresua soils have finer textured profiles and are less acid.  The Junquitos and Gurabo soils have finer textured profiles and have low chroma mottles within 20 inches of the surface.  The Dique, Humacao and Mani soils lack the coarse fragments and have irregular distribution of organic matter with depth.  The Caguabo and Malaya soils have semi-consolidated volcanic rock within 20 inches of the surface.  The Juncos and Montegrande soils have horizons with COLE values exceeding 0.09."

The regolith consists of fine and moderately fine textured residuum derived from volcanic conglomerates.  The climate is humid tropical. The average annual precipitation is 80 inches and the mean annual temperature 76 degrees F.   The soil temperature at depth or 20 inches is over 71.6 degrees F and the difference between mean summer and winter temperatures is less than 9 degrees F.  See Remarks."
