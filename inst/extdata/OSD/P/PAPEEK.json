  "OVERVIEW": "The Papeek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on hills and mountain slopes and toe slopes.  These soils formed in material weathered from metavolcanic or metasedimentary rock.  Slopes range from 5 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
