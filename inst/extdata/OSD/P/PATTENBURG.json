  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 36 inches. Depth to bedrock averages more than 6 feet and ranges from 3 1/2 to 8 or more feet. Rock fragment content ranges from 10 to 45 percent in solum and from 35 to 75 percent in the substratum, but averages more than 35 percent in the control section. Rock fragments consist of dominantly quartzite, some high in hematite, and lesser amounts of red sandstone and sandy red shale. Rock fragment size is dominantly gravel but includes cobbles. The soil is strongly or very strongly acid throughout, unless limed.\nThe Ap horizon ranges from dark brown (7.5YR 4/2) through reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4). Fine-earth texture is loam or sandy loam. It has moderate to weak fine granular structure. Many undisturbed pedons have very thin, black A horizons overlying 6- to 9-inch yellowish red (5YR 5/6) eluvial horizons.\nThe B horizon ranges from yellowish red (5YR 4/6) through dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) and weak red (10R 4/4). Fine-earth texture is usually loam or silt loam, but includes clay loam, sandy loam and sandy clay loam. It contains 15 to 30 percent clay. The B horizon ranges from 25 to 45 percent rock fragments. It has moderate or weak fine or medium subangular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon ranges from dusky red (10R 3/2) through yellowish red (5YR 4/6). Fine-earth texture is loam or sandy loam."

Hartleton soils have fragments that are dominantly shale, siltstone and sandstone channers and Bt horizons of 7.5YR or yellower hue. Irondale soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Macove soils have a hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the C horizon and rock fragments that are dominantly shale, siltstone and sandstone. Trevlac soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pattenburg soils are on rolling to hilly uplands in the Triassic section of the Northern Piedmont at the base of the scarp between the Piedmont and the highlands. Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent. The regolith is weathered from reddish quartzose conglomerate or fanglomerate. Mean annual air temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 40 to 48 inches. Frost free days range from 160 to 190."

All of these soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. Additionally, Annandale soils have a fragipan and the Duffield and Washington soils have base saturation higher than 35 percent and overlie limestone or limey conglomerate. Edneyville soils have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and have rock fragments consisting of dominantly granitic gneiss. Penn soils have bedrock at depths between 20 and 40 inches. Raritan soils are on terraces and have a fragipan. Rowland soils are on flood plains and lack an argillic horizon."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Pattenburg soils were classified in the Gray-Brown Podzolic great soil group in the 1938 system.\nThe 12/2005 revision places the Pattenburg series in an active CEC activity class based on NASIS data and geographically associated soils. Competing series were also updated revised and other minor edits were completed.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 14 inches (Ap and BA horizons).\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 14 to 30 inches (Bt horizon).\n3. Lithic contact - at 60 inches (top of the R horizon).\n4. Loamy-skeletal family  35 percent or more rock fragments and less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section (Bt horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA: No laboratory data are available.\nMLRA: 148\nREVISED: 04/81-CFE-JEW; 12/2005-RJE, DHK\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
