  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Depth to the fragipan is 20 to 36 inches.  Chert content is less than 5 percent in the A and upper B horizons, 0 to 15 percent in the Bt horizon, 0 to 70 percent in the fragipan (2Btx) and 10 to 50 percent in the 3Bt horizon.\nThe Ap or A horizon has value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 5.  The E horizon, where present, has value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  The A and E horizons are silt loam, but eroded areas can be silty clay loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Iron depletions with value of 4 or more and chroma of 2 or less are present in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon. The lower Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4 with higher chroma iron masses or lower chroma iron depletions. It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction is strongly acid to extremely acid, but may range up to neutral in areas that were limed.\nThe 2Btx horizon is mottled.  Clay films, clay flows, or plugs are common.  It is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam or their gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogues. Reaction is strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe 3Bt horizon has mottled colors with hue of 10R to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay, or their gravelly, cobbly, very cobbly, or very gravelly analogues.  Reaction is strongly acid to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These nearly level and gently sloping soils are on upland broad ridgetops.  Slope gradients are usually less than 4 percent, but range from 0 to 8 percent.  The regolith consists of a thin mantle of loess over residuum from cherty limestone or dolomite.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 44 inches."

Union soils are moderately well drained and are on similar landscapes adjacent to the Plato soils.  Viraton soils are fine-loamy and Wilderness soils are loamy-skeletal.  These soils are on upper sideslopes and rounded ridgetops below the Plato soils."

Permeability is moderately slow above the fragipan, very slow in the fragipan, and moderate below the fragipan.  The saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high above and below the fragipan and low in the fragipan. A seasonal high water table is perched from 1.0 to 2.0 feet during December through April in most years."
