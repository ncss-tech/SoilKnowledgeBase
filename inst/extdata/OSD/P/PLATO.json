  "OVERVIEW": "The Plato series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that have a fragipan at depths of 20 to 36 inches. These soils formed in loess and the underlying cherty residuum on uplands. Permeability is moderately slow above the fragipan, very slow in the fragipan and moderate below the fragipan. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",

Chert content is less than 5 percent in the A and upper B horizons, 0 to 15 percent in the Bt horizon, 0 to 70 percent in the fragipan (2Btx) and 10 to 50 percent in the 3Bt horizon.\nThe Ap or A horizon has value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 5.  The E horizon, where present, has value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  The A and E horizons are silt loam, but eroded areas can be silty clay loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Iron depletions with value of 4 or more and chroma of 2 or less are present in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon. The lower Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4 with higher chroma iron masses or lower chroma iron depletions. It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction is strongly acid to extremely acid, but may range up to neutral in areas that were limed.\nThe 2Btx horizon is mottled.  Clay films, clay flows, or plugs are common.  It is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam or their gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogues. Reaction is strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe 3Bt horizon has mottled colors with hue of 10R to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay, or their gravelly, cobbly, very cobbly, or very gravelly analogues.  Reaction is strongly acid to moderately alkaline."
