  "REVDATE": "11/2017",
  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pomello series consists of very deep, moderately well to somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in sandy marine sediments.  Pomello soils are on ridges, hills, and knolls in the flatwoods on marine terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1397 millimeters (55 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C (72 degrees F).",
