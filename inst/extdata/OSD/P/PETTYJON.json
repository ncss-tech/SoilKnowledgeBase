  "STATES": "TN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pettyjon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium from shales and limestone.  They are formed on flood plains in the Ridge and Valley portion of the Southern Appalachians.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.",

Texture is silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe BA horizon, where present, and the Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4, or is profusely mottled with redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, and gray.
