Texture is silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe BA horizon, where present, and the Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4, or is profusely mottled with redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, and gray.

Ocana soils contain 15 to 35 percent by volume of chert fragments throughout the solum.  Tuckahoe soils formed in alluvium from Piedmont and Upper Coastal Plain Material and have less than 45 percent sand in the B horizon. The Hannahatchee and Sullivan soils have siliceous mineralogy."
