  "OVERVIEW": "The Pula series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Pula soils are on fan piedmont remnants and terrace side slopes.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
