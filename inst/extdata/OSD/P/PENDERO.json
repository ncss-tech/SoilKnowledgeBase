  "OVERVIEW": "The Pendero series consists of very deep, excessively drained, moderately rapid permeable soils formed in eolian sands.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on sand sheets on basin floors.  Slope ranges from 2 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
