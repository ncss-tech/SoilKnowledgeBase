  "OVERVIEW": "The Pamison series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  The Pamison soils are on summits and side slopes of fan piedmont remnants.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
