  "OVERVIEW": "The Penargyl series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in young till derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock overlying residuum weathered from acid brown shale on gently sloping to sloping ground moraine on uplands in the Glaciated Allegheny Plateau and Catskill Mountains Province. Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent. Lowest saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Mean annual precipitation is 44 to 48 inches, and mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 70 inches or more. Depth to consolidated shale bedrock is 60 inches to 10 feet or more, where depth to unconsolidated shale often is within 7 feet. Where present, depth to lithologic discontinuity ranges from 24 to 60 inches or more. Often the depth of overlying till parent material is greater than 6 feet. Rock fragments in individual horizons of rounded sandstone pebbles and cobbles and of subangular shale and siltstone channers range from 0 to 30 percent in the upper part where sandstone fragments predominate and from 20 to 65 percent in the lower part of the solum and in the 2C horizon where shales predominate. The particle size control section averages less than 35 percent rock fragments, 20 to 34 percent clay, and 34 to 45 percent fine sand or coarser. The reaction in unlimed soils ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid in the upper part of the mineral solum and is very strongly through slightly acid in the lower part of the solum and the 2C horizon.\nThe Ap or A horizon has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. Textures of the fine-earth fraction are loam, silt loam. Some pedons have a BA horizon with similar ranges in color and texture.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8 in the matrix. Textures of the fine-earth fraction are loam, silt loam, clay loam, and silty clay loam.\nWhere present, the 2Bt horizon have hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8 in the matrix. Textures of the fine-earth fraction are loam, silt loam, clay loam, and silty clay loam. Shale rock fragments dominate.\nThe 2C horizon has a hue of 5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and a chroma of 4 through 8. Textures of the fine-earth fraction are loam, silt loam, clay loam, and less commonly sandy loam. Some pedons have BC and C horizons with similar ranges in color and texture."

Arcola soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a siltstone or sandstone paralithic contact. Bedington soils are formed in residuum weathered from siltstone, shale or sandstone in the Northern Appalachian Valley and Ridge Province. Bucks and Quakertown soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to sandstone, siltstone, or shale bedrock. Collington, Freehold, and Wist soils are formed in marine sediments containing glauconite. Edgemont soils formed in residuum weathered form quartzite rocks and are 3.5 to 7 feet deep to bedrock. Edneytown soils have a solum thinner than 30 inches and lack 5YR color in the Bt. The Germania (T) soils formed in alluvial fans. Gilpin soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to shale or siltstone bedrock. Gladstone soils formed in colluvium and residuum formed from granitic gneiss. Joanna and Leedsville soils formed in residuum from Triassic red sandstone and conglomerate containing quartz pebbles. Millstone soils are well drained soils on stream terraces and flood-plain steps. They formed in loamy alluvium. Pennval soils are formed in colluvium from interbedded shale and siltstone, or sandstone on footslopes of prominent valley ridges. Pigeonroost soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a gneissic paralithic contact and are formed in residuum affected by soil creep in the upper part and weathered from felsic to mafic, igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks. Pineville soils formed in colluvium from sandstone, shale, and siltstone. Rayne soils are also formed in residuum weathered from siltstone, shale or sandstone in the Eastern and Central Allegheny Plateau Province. Shelocta soils formed in colluvium and residuum from shale, siltstone, and sandstone and are greater than 48 inches deep to bedrock. Syenite soils are 20 to 40 inches deep formed in loess over granite residuum and have granite rock fragments."
