  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 70 inches or more. Depth to consolidated shale bedrock is 60 inches to 10 feet or more, where depth to unconsolidated shale often is within 7 feet. Where present, depth to lithologic discontinuity ranges from 24 to 60 inches or more. Often the depth of overlying till parent material is greater than 6 feet. Rock fragments in individual horizons of rounded sandstone pebbles and cobbles and of subangular shale and siltstone channers range from 0 to 30 percent in the upper part where sandstone fragments predominate and from 20 to 65 percent in the lower part of the solum and in the 2C horizon where shales predominate. The particle size control section averages less than 35 percent rock fragments, 20 to 34 percent clay, and 34 to 45 percent fine sand or coarser. The reaction in unlimed soils ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid in the upper part of the mineral solum and is very strongly through slightly acid in the lower part of the solum and the 2C horizon.\nThe Ap or A horizon has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. Textures of the fine-earth fraction are loam, silt loam. Some pedons have a BA horizon with similar ranges in color and texture.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8 in the matrix. Textures of the fine-earth fraction are loam, silt loam, clay loam, and silty clay loam.\nWhere present, the 2Bt horizon have hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8 in the matrix. Textures of the fine-earth fraction are loam, silt loam, clay loam, and silty clay loam. Shale rock fragments dominate.\nThe 2C horizon has a hue of 5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and a chroma of 4 through 8. Textures of the fine-earth fraction are loam, silt loam, clay loam, and less commonly sandy loam. Some pedons have BC and C horizons with similar ranges in color and texture."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the, Arcola, Bedington, Bucks, Collington, Edgemont, Edneytown, Freehold, Germania (T), Gilpin, Gladstone, Joanna, Leedsville, Millstone, Pennval, Pigeonroost, Pineville, Quakertown, Rayne, Shelocta, Syenite, and Wist series are in the same family. Arcola soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a siltstone or sandstone paralithic contact. Bedington soils are formed in residuum weathered from siltstone, shale or sandstone in the Northern Appalachian Valley and Ridge Province. Bucks and Quakertown soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to sandstone, siltstone, or shale bedrock. Collington, Freehold, and Wist soils are formed in marine sediments containing glauconite. Edgemont soils formed in residuum weathered form quartzite rocks and are 3.5 to 7 feet deep to bedrock. Edneytown soils have a solum thinner than 30 inches and lack 5YR color in the Bt. The Germania (T) soils formed in alluvial fans. Gilpin soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to shale or siltstone bedrock. Gladstone soils formed in colluvium and residuum formed from granitic gneiss. Joanna and Leedsville soils formed in residuum from Triassic red sandstone and conglomerate containing quartz pebbles. Millstone soils are well drained soils on stream terraces and flood-plain steps. They formed in loamy alluvium. Pennval soils are formed in colluvium from interbedded shale and siltstone, or sandstone on footslopes of prominent valley ridges. Pigeonroost soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a gneissic paralithic contact and are formed in residuum affected by soil creep in the upper part and weathered from felsic to mafic, igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks. Pineville soils formed in colluvium from sandstone, shale, and siltstone. Rayne soils are also formed in residuum weathered from siltstone, shale or sandstone in the Eastern and Central Allegheny Plateau Province. Shelocta soils formed in colluvium and residuum from shale, siltstone, and sandstone and are greater than 48 inches deep to bedrock. Syenite soils are 20 to 40 inches deep formed in loess over granite residuum and have granite rock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Penargyl soils are on gently sloping to sloping summits, shoulders and backslopes. Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent. They are formed in young thin ground moraine underlain by shale residuum. Climate is temperate and humid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches, mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F, frost free days range from 150 to 195 days, and elevation ranges from 200 feet to 1200 feet above sea level."

The well drained and shallow Arnot and moderately deep Manlius are on the same landscape and parent material. The well drained shallow Weikert, moderately deep Berks, and very deep moderately well drained Comly soils are on adjacent driftless landscapes formed in acid brown shale residuum. The very deep, somewhat poorly drained Volusia and poorly drained Chippewa soils occurs downslope. The well drained, very deep Connotton, somewhat poorly drained, very deep Red Hook soils are on adjacent landscapes formed in sandy and gravelly glacial outwash. The poorly drained Holly soils are on nearby floodplains. The well and moderately well drained, deep and very deep Swartswood and the very deep and moderately well drained Wurtsboro soils are on nearby landscapes of deeper young till."
