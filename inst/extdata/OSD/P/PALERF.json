    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 49 to 54 degrees F. These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 100 to 120 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 23 to 40 inches and includes all or part of the argillic horizon. The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 grams per cubic centimeter, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 0.7 percent, and 15 bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples. The particle-size control section averages 40 to 60 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 35 to 65 percent coarse fragments by volume. Organic matter is estimated to range from 1 to 3 percent. Solum thickness and depth to lithic contact ranges from 25 to 40 inches. There is an absolute clay difference of 15 to 20 percent between the AB and 2Bt horizons.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.\nThe AB horizon has  value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist. It has 15 to 25 percent clay.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bt horizon has  hue of 10YR or 7.5 YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Texture is very cobbly clay loam, very gravelly clay or very gravelly clay loam with 35 to 45 percent clay. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Btk horizon has  hue of 10 YR or 7.5 YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist. Texture is very cobbly clay, extremely cobbly clay, or extremely gravelly clay loam with 35 to 60 percent clay. It has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 15 to 25 percent. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline"

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Palerf soils are on hillslopes and have slopes of 15 to 70 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt and loess mixed with volcanic ash in the surface. Elevations are 1,800 feet to 2,500 feet. These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches. The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 69 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is 130 to 170 days."
