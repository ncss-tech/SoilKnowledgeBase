  "OVERVIEW": "The Pomat series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources and alluvium derived from limestone and sandstone.  Pomat soils are on lake plains, intermediate-level and high-level lake terraces, and on escarpments of terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
