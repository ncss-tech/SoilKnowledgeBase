  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pomat soils are on lake plains, intermediate-level and high-level lake terraces, and escarpments of terraces.  These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources and alluvium derived from limestone and sandstone.  Slopes are 1 to 40 percent.  Elevations range from 4,600 to 5,400 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches, the mean annual temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."

Kessler soils have more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Kearns and the Red Rock soils have mollic epipedons and cambic horizons.  Parleys, Timpanogos and Kearns soils have mollic epipedons, argillic horizons, and calcic horizons."
