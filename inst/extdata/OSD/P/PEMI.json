Reaction ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid in the solum and from strongly acid through neutral in the substratum.\nSome pedons have an O horizon that is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.\nIt is up to 3 inches thick.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Dry color is 6 or more.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is similar to the Ap horizon.\nSome pedons have an E horizon that is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The are no series in the same family.  The Binghamville, Birdsall, Burnham, Medomak, Raynham, Roundabout, Saco, and Swanville series are similar soils in related families.  Binghamville soils have a mesic soil temperature regimes. Birdsall soils have an umbric epipedon.  Burnham soils are coarse-loamy and have more rock fragments throughout.  Medomak and Saco soils have umbric epipedons and an irregular decrease in organic carbon content. Raynham, Roundabout, and Swanville soils have a horizon between a depth of 10 and 30 inches with chroma higher than 2 in 50 percent or more of the matrix and Swanville soils are fine-silty."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pemi soils are on nearly level to gently sloping terraces or lake plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. They formed in medium textured lacustrine sediments of Wisconsin age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 47 degrees F.  The growing season ranges from 80 to 130 days."

Pemi soils are in a drainage sequence with the well drained Salmon, moderately well drained Nicholville, and somewhat poorly and poorly drained Roundabout and Swanville soils.  Biddeford, Kinsman, Naumburg, Scantic, and Searsport soils are in similar positions on the landscape.  Biddeford and Scantic soils formed in clayey material and Kinsman, Naumburg, and Searsport soils formed in sandy material.  Charles, Cornish, Fryeburg, Lovewell, Medomak, Ondawa, Podunk, and Rumney soils are on adjacent floodplains and have an irregular decrease in organic matter."

This series has been classified to the 8th edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy.  The former classification was coarse-silty, mixed, nonacid, frigid Typic Haplaquepts.\n3.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (Ap horizon).\nb.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 6 to 25 inches (Bg horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
