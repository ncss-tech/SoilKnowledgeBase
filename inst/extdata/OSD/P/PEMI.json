  "OVERVIEW": "The Pemi series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in silty lacustrine sediments on nearly level to gently sloping terraces or lake plains.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow or slow in the substratum.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Reaction ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid in the solum and from strongly acid through neutral in the substratum.\nSome pedons have an O horizon that is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.\nIt is up to 3 inches thick.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Dry color is 6 or more.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is similar to the Ap horizon.\nSome pedons have an E horizon that is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.

The Binghamville, Birdsall, Burnham, Medomak, Raynham, Roundabout, Saco, and Swanville series are similar soils in related families.  Binghamville soils have a mesic soil temperature regimes. Birdsall soils have an umbric epipedon.  Burnham soils are coarse-loamy and have more rock fragments throughout.  Medomak and Saco soils have umbric epipedons and an irregular decrease in organic carbon content. Raynham, Roundabout, and Swanville soils have a horizon between a depth of 10 and 30 inches with chroma higher than 2 in 50 percent or more of the matrix and Swanville soils are fine-silty."

Pemi soils are in a drainage sequence with the well drained Salmon, moderately well drained Nicholville, and somewhat poorly and poorly drained Roundabout and Swanville soils.  Biddeford, Kinsman, Naumburg, Scantic, and Searsport soils are in similar positions on the landscape.  Biddeford and Scantic soils formed in clayey material and Kinsman, Naumburg, and Searsport soils formed in sandy material.  Charles, Cornish, Fryeburg, Lovewell, Medomak, Ondawa, Podunk, and Rumney soils are on adjacent floodplains and have an irregular decrease in organic matter."

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (Ap horizon).\nb.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 6 to 25 inches (Bg horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
