  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pathead series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale. These soils are on benches and mountain slopes. Slopes range from 20 to 80 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
