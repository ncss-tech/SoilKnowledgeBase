The soils are on nearly level to gently sloping alluvial plains. Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent. The soils formed in alluvium from basic volcanic ash and basaltic lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 178 to 254 millimeters (7 to 10 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 2,286 to 2,540 meters (90 to 100 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 21 to 24 degrees C. (70 to 75 degrees F.) The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)"
