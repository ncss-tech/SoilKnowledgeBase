They formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess and the underlying paleosol from loamy lacustrine sediments, or loess and the underlying alluvial sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 965 to 1168 mm (38 to 46 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 170 to 190 days. Elevation is 122 to 244 meters (400 to 800 feet) above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Dubois soils are on nearly level to gently sloping summits and shoulders. The moderately well drained Haubstadt soils and the moderately well drained Otwell soils are on summits, shoulders and backslopes. To a minor extent, Peoga soils are associated with the Bartle and Pekin soils on stream terraces. The somewhat poorly drained Bartle soils are on slightly higher lying parts of treads. The moderately well drained Pekin soils are on dominantly on gently sloping parts of treads and on risers."

In undrained areas, the depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 feet) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 feet) below the surface between November and June in normal years. In drained areas, the depth to the top of the perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between December and May in normal years. The potential for surface water runoff is low or negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low or moderately high in the upper part of the solum and low to moderately high in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow or very slow in the lower part."
