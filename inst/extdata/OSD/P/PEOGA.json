  "OVERVIEW": "The Peoga series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loess and the underlying loamy lacustrine or alluvial sediments. They are on lake plains and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

To a minor extent, Peoga soils are associated with the Bartle and Pekin soils on stream terraces. The somewhat poorly drained Bartle soils are on slightly higher lying parts of treads.
