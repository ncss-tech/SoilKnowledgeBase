  "OVERVIEW": "The Pitzer series consists of soils that are very shallow or shallow to a petrocalcic horizon. They are well drained and moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy, gravelly materials.  These soils are on gently sloping to strongly sloping uplands.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 4 to 20 inches.  Depth to layers containing more than 35 percent coarse fragments of siliceous and limestone pebbles ranges from 10 to 36 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, clay loam, gravelly loam, or gravelly clay loam; coarse fragments of caliche and siliceous pebbles comprise 5 to 30 percent.\nThe Bkm horizon is platy or nodular in the upper portion, is massive in the lower portion, and is 4 to 24 inches thick. Hardness on Moh's scale is 2 to 3.5.\nThe BCk horizon has 35 to 80 percent by volume of siliceous and limestone pebbles that are coated with secondary calcium carbonate.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  This horizon is weakly consolidated or weakly cemented and in some pedons contains strata with varying percentages of coarse fragments.\nDepth to a 2Cd horizon of weathered shale or a 2R horizon of limestone, when either are present, is 40 to more than 80 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Carbine (AZ), Espy (TX), Kimbrough, and Queeny (TX) series.   Similar soils include the Cho, Kavett, and Mereta series.  Carbine soils do not have shale or limestone below the petrocalcic horizon.  Espy soils have a cambic horizon separating the mollic epipedon from the petrocalcic horizon.  Kimbrough soils have an aridic moisture regime, and in addition, do not have gravelly substrata containing siliceous pebbles.  Queeny soils are moist for longer periods in the moisture control section.  Cho soils do not have layers, within a 40-inch depth, with more than 35 percent coarse fragments of siliceous and limestone pebbles.  Kavett, and Mereta soils are clayey, and in addition, do not have gravelly substrata containing siliceous pebbles."
