  "OVERVIEW": "The Panama series consists of deep, well drained, moderately\nslowly permeable, gravelly soils that formed in loamy colluvium over clay. The clay weathered from shale of Pennsylvanian age.  Panama soils are on colluvial benches and footslopes in the valleys of the Ouachita Mountains and the Arkansas Valley and Ridges. Slopes are from 12 to 70 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 48 inches.",
