    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Corboldt, Exira, Galva, Keg, Marshall, Monona, Nira, Northboro, Port Byron, Raddle, Sac, Salix, and Truman series.  Similar soils are the Moody and Nora soils.  Corboldt soils have thicker sola and have free carbonates at deeper depths.  Exira, Galva, Keg, Marshall, Monona, Nira, Port Byron, Sac, and Salix soils are leached of calcium carbonates to depths greater than 24 inches.  In addition, in Sac soils, the lower part of the sola is formed in glacial till.  Northboro soils have redder hues in the B horizon and more sand throughout the solum.  Raddle soils typically have thicker sola, tend to be more acid, and are deeper to free carbonates.  Truman soils have a thicker mollic epipedon.  Moody and Nora soils are drier for longer periods."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in loess.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 51 to 55 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 32 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Marshall and Monona soils and the Ida and Judson soils.  Ida soils do not have a mollic epipedon, have free carbonates within a depth of 10 inches and have a thinner solum and typically are on steeper slopes.  Judson soils have a thicker mollic epipedon and are below Ponca soils.  Marshall and Monona soils are on similar landscapes."
