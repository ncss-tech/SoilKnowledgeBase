Behanin and Marcetta soils have E horizons.  Belsac soils have carbonates at 20 to 25 inches and are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.  Blanca, Campone, Gateview, Hapgood, Harcany, Lolon, Nevtah, Snag, and Spearhead soils lack cambic horizons.  Busterback soils have sandy textures in the substratum and are moderately or strongly acid.  Caballo soils are dry in some parts during the spring, have 18 to 35 percent clay and are calcareous in part of the control section. Croesus, Dateman, Nagitsy, Namela, Prong, and Splitbutte soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Darland soils have an average annual soil temperature of more than 43 degrees F. and an average annual precipitation of more than 50 inches. Hobacker soils are calcareous in the control section.  Lionhead soils have Bk horizons at depths of 18 to 37 inches.  Nazaton soils have an 0 horizon and an average summer soil temperature of 45 to 47 degrees F. Papaspila soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have average summer soil temperatures of 44 to 47 degrees F.  Poleline soils have a solum 40 to 60 inches thick. Snopoc soils lack a cambic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Povey soils are on north and east facing hills, canyon side slopes, and mountains. They are on all aspects above about 7,000 feet.  Slopes range from 2 to 70 percent.  Elevations range from 5,000 to 9,600 feet.  The soil formed in residuum, alluvium and colluvium from quartzitic sandstone, igneous, or quartzitic metamorphic rocks.  Some areas have some loess influence in the upper part.  The average annual precipitation is 16 to 26 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rains.  The average annual temperature is 35 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free period is less than 70 days."
