The organic matter content of 1 percent or more extends to less than 20 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 60 to 63 degrees F. These soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section more than 50 percent of time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. but are continually dry for 50 to 70 consecutive days during the summer months in more than 6 out of 10 years.\nThe Al horizon has chroma of 2 or 3. It has fine granular or subangular blocky structure. This horizon is soft or slightly hard. It is 5 to 10 inches thick.\nThe B2t horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is clay loam containing 27 to 35 percent clay. This horizon has weak coarse or moderate fine angular blocky structure.\nThe B3tca horizon has loam than 1 percent organic matter. The Cca horizon hds value of 7 or 8 dry."
