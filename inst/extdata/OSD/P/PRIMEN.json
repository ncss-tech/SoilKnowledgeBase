  "OVERVIEW": "The Primen series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in clayey, gravelly and cobbly material derived from mixed sources.  These soils are on side slopes and convex ridges and have slopes of 9 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 20 inches thick and in some pedons includes the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Solum thickness and the depth to paralithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent by volume and are dominantly 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter. Some pedons are calcareous throughout with a calcium carbonate equivalent less than 15 percent.  Mean annual soil temperature is less than 15 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has cobbly, very cobbly, very stony, or extremely stony modifiers of the fine earth fraction. Reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 with the darker colors in the upper part.  It is gravelly clay loam, gravelly clay, cobbly clay loam, or cobbly clay and clay content ranges from 35 to 50 percent.  Reaction is mildly to moderately alkaline.\nIICr is soft shales, sandstones, and mudstones."
