    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 20 inches thick and in some pedons includes the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Solum thickness and the depth to paralithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent by volume and are dominantly 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter. Some pedons are calcareous throughout with a calcium carbonate equivalent less than 15 percent.  Mean annual soil temperature is less than 15 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has cobbly, very cobbly, very stony, or extremely stony modifiers of the fine earth fraction. Reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 with the darker colors in the upper part.  It is gravelly clay loam, gravelly clay, cobbly clay loam, or cobbly clay and clay content ranges from 35 to 50 percent.  Reaction is mildly to moderately alkaline.\nIICr is soft shales, sandstones, and mudstones."

They formed in a semiarid climate with average annual precipitation ranging from 13 to 17 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 125 to 145 days."
