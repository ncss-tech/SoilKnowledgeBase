  "OVERVIEW": "The Puuone series consists of somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in material derived from coral seashells. Puuone soils are on sand hills and have slopes of 7 to 30 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 75 degrees F.",
