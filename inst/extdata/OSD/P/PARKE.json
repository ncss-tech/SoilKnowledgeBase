  "OVERVIEW": "The Parke series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying paleosol in outwash. The Parke soils are on eskers, crevasse fillings, and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).",
