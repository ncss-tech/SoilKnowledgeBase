    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Parke soils are on summits, shoulders and backslopes of eskers, crevasse fillings, and dissected outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. The soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying paleosol in loamy outwash. The other silty material (2Bt horizons) consists of a mixing zone between the loess and the underlying outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1143 mm (40 to 45 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 13 degrees C (52 to 56 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 170 to 210 days. Elevation ranges from 152 to 274 meters (500 to 900 feet) above mean sea level."
