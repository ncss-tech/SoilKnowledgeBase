  "OVERVIEW": "The Pavillion series is a member of the fine-loamy, mixed, mesic family of Typic Camborthids. Typically, Pavillion soils have very friable granular A horizons, sandy clay loam B2 horizons having prismatic and subangular blocky structure, and sandy clay loam Cca horizons over bedrock at depth of 32 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Usually these soils are leached to a depth of 7 or 8 inches but depth to calcareous material ranges from 0 to 12 inches. Thickness of solum ranges from 15 to 24 inches, and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Weighted average organic content of the surface 15 inches ranges from .3 to .5 percent. The sand/clay ratio ranges from 2 to 4. The control section is typically sandy clay loam, but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 5 to 30 percent, and sand from 45 to 70 percent with more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser. Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent but are usually less than 10 percent. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 51 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature from 60 degrees to 68 degrees F. The A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is neutral to moderately alkaline (pH 7.0 to 8.0). This horizon usually has granular or crumb structure, but it has alkaline (pH 7.0 to 8.0). This horizon usually has granular or crumb structure, but it has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is mildly or moderately alkaline (pH 7.8 to 8.4). The Cca horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR. It is moderately or strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to 8.6), and has 2 to 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. There are a few crystals of calcium sulfate immediately above the bedrock in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  Pavillion soil are on gently to moderately sloping upland hills and ridges. Slope gradients range from 2 to about 20 percent.  They formed in moderately thick, calcareous parent sediments weathered residually from sedimentary bedrock or locally transported and redeposited over bedrock. At the type location, the mean annual precipitation is 7 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer months. Mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 66 degrees F."
