  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Adco, Appanoose, Awbrig, Belinda, Chariton, Dayton, Glensted, Rubio and Wagner series. Adco soils are somewhat poorly drained and have dominant chroma of more than 2 in some part of the upper 50 centimeters (20 inches) of the argillic horizon. Appanoose soils do not have a strongly expressed abrupt clay increase between the A and B horizons, do not have a lithologic discontinuity within a depth of 152 centimeters (60 inches), and formed entirely in loess. Awbrig soils have a lithologic discontinuity at depths of less than 102 centimeters (40 inches), typically do not have albic horizons and formed in mixed alluvium. Belinda soils average less than 48 percent clay in the particle size control section, do not have a lithologic discontinuity within a depth of 152 centimeters (60 inches), and formed entirely in loess. Chariton soils have more than 15 percent sand in the lower part of the soil profile, which formed in alluvium. Dayton soils have a lithologic discontinuity at depths of less than 102 centimeters (40 inches), are in areas that have a mean annual precipitation range of 1,010 to 1,270 millimeters (40 to 50 inches), and formed in glaciolacustrine deposits. Glensted soils average less than 48 percent clay in the particle size control section, have a lithologic discontinuity at depths of less than 102 centimeters (40 inches), and formed in loess and residuum from cherty limestone and shale. Rubio soils average less than 48 percent clay in the particle size control section, are less than 203 centimeters (80 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon, and formed entirely in loess. Wagner soils average less than 48 percent clay in the particle size control section, are less than 200 centimeters (80 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon, and formed in alluvium or lacustrine sediments."

These soils formed in 102 to 156 centimeters (40 to 61 inches) of loess and the underlying loamy sediments derived from pre-Illinoian till. Slopes are dominantly less than 1 percent and range to 3 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1016 millimeters (35 to 40 inches)."
