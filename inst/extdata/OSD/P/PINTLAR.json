  "OVERVIEW": "The Pintlar series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on stream terraces, swales and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 4 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
