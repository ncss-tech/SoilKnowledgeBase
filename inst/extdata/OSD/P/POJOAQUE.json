Kishona soils are moist for 60 consecutive days following the end of April, when the soil temperature is 41 degrees F., or greater and they are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 60 days from July 15 to October 25.  Theedle soils are less than 40 inches to a paralithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pojoaque soils are on 5 to 30 percent slopes in the highly dissected Santa Fe Formation.  The soils formed in medium to moderately fine textured calcareous sediments derived mostly from granite, gneiss, schist, sandstone and some limestone.  The climate is semiarid continental.  Average annual precipitation is about 10 to 14 inches.  Mean summer temperature is about 68 degrees F.  The precipitation pattern is characterized  by a marked summer maximum occurring as thunderstorms usually of short duration."
