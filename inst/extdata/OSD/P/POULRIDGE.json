  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Poulridge soils are on hills, mountain slopes, summits and shoulders. Slope ranges from 5 to 45 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from loess over weakly cemented volcanic ash. Elevations are 1825 to 2175 meters. The climate is characterized by long, cold winters and warm dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 430 to 610 mm which includes 91 to 152 cm of snow. The mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C. The frost-free period is 55 to 70 days."
