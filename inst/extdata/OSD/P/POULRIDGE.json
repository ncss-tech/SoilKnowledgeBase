  "OVERVIEW": "The Poulridge series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium over weakly cemented volcanic ash.  The Poulridge soils are on hills, mountain slopes, summits and shoulders.  Slope ranges from 5 to 45 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 4 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm.",
