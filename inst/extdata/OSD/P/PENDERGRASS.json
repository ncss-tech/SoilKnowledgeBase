  "OVERVIEW": "The Pendergrass series consists of shallow, well to excessively drained soils that formed in moderately coarse textured material weathered from redbed sandstone, Pendergrass soils are on mountainsides and ridges and have slopes of 5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.   The control section is usually channery fine sandy loam and has 5 to 18 percent clay in the fine earth fraction.  Rock fragments average 35 to 70 percent with most of the fragment being less than 6 inches in length.   Average annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F., and the average summer soil temperature ranges from 55 to 58 degrees F.\nThe A and C horizon range from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Usually the A horizon has granular structure but it has subangular blocky structure in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR."

At the type location the annual precipitation is about 15 inches, most of which falls during the spring and summe.  The frost-free season is about 60 to 85 days."
