  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. GRB",
  "REVDATE": "09/2002",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pellejas series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils on side slopes and narrow ridges.  They formed in coarse textured residuum that weathered from plutonic rocks.  Near the type location,  the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches.  Slopes range from 40 to 60 percent.",
