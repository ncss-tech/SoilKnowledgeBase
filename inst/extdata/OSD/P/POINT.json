  "OVERVIEW": "The Point series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in a thin sandy mantle and in the underlying loamy glacial till or loamy residuum weathered from igneous and metamorphic bedrock, or a mixture of the two.  These soils are on ground moraines. Permeability is moderately rapid or rapid in the sandy mantle and moderate or moderately slow in the till or residuum. Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 24 to 50 inches.   Thickness of the sandy mantle ranges from 10 to 20 inches. The particle-size control section averages between 18 and 30 percent clay and between 15 and 50 percent fine sand or coarser. Rock fragments typically are absent in the sandy mantle but volume of gravel (mostly rounded) ranges up to 5 percent in some pedons. Volume gravel (mostly angular) ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the loamy part of the solum (2E, 2B) and from 5 to 30 percent in the substratum.  Volume of angular cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the loamy part of the solum and 0 to 20 percent in the substratum. Reaction naturally ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the sandy mantle but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the till or residuum. Redox accumulations are throughout the soil below the A horizon. Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon and saturation occurs there for some time in most years.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture of the Ap or A horizon is loamy sand.\nSome pedons have a Bs horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  However, these horizons aretoo thin or do not meet the chemical requirements for a spodic horizon.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe 2E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nPoint soils have a glossic horizon (2E/B or 2B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 4 or 5.  Texture is sandy loam, loam, or clay loam.\nThe 2Bthorizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 2 to 8.  Value of 3 does not occur with chroma of 2 or 3. Less than 20 percent of the matrix has chroma of 2. Texture is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8. Colors are often variegated. Texture is loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or the cobbly or gravelly analogs of these textures."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Field experience indicates that these soils have some evidence of glacial till overlying the residuum or a mixture of till and residuum in the lower part of the profile.\n2006  This revision redefines the series to require a thin (10-20) sandy mantle over the till. This was done to differentiate it from the Meadland series. There are 17,600 acres correlated in Portage County as Point sandy loam that should be correlated to the Meadland series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nochric epipedon - 0 to 7 inches (Ap);\nalbic horizon - 7 to 26 inches (E1, E2, E part of E/B); glossic horizon  20 to 26 inches (E/B);\nargillic horizon - 26 to 40 inches (2Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3);\naquic feature  redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less and saturation in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon."
