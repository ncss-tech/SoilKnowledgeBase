    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pinkcan soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from various igneous rocks and/or gneiss. Elevations range from 735 to 1,230 meters (2,410 to 4,034 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 175 millimeters (4 to 7 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 13 to 20 degrees C (55 to 68 degrees F). The frost-free season is 270 to 320 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Crackerjack, Crosgrain, Gocougs, Grinder and Werewolf soils. All of these soils are on similar landforms except for Grinder soils which are on nearby pediments. Crackerjack soils have less than 18 percent clay throughout the particle-size control section, do not have an argillic horizon and are shallow to a weakly-cemented duripan. Crosgrain soils also have less than 18 percent clay in the particle- size control section, do not contain an argillic horizon and are skeletal above a shallow indurated duripan. Gocougs soils are similar but have a duripan beginning above 100 centimeters. Grinder soils do not have a duripan and are shallow to a lithic contact. Werewolf soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections, an argillic horizon that starts below 25 centimeters and no duripan within 150 centimeters."
