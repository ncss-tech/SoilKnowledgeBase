  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinkcan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from various igneous rocks and/or gneiss. Pinkcan soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 138 millimeters (5.5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16.5 degrees C (615 degrees F).",

All of these soils are on similar landforms except for Grinder soils which are on nearby pediments. Crackerjack soils have less than 18 percent clay throughout the particle-size control section, do not have an argillic horizon and are shallow to a weakly-cemented duripan. Crosgrain soils also have less than 18 percent clay in the particle- size control section, do not contain an argillic horizon and are skeletal above a shallow indurated duripan. Gocougs soils are similar but have a duripan beginning above 100 centimeters. Grinder soils do not have a duripan and are shallow to a lithic contact. Werewolf soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections, an argillic horizon that starts below 25 centimeters and no duripan within 150 centimeters."
