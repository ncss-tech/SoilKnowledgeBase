  "OVERVIEW": "The Peetz series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in gravelly, calcareous, coarse textured Ogallala deposits.  Peetz soils are on knob-like areas and ridges in gravelly upland and terrace breaks.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 41 centimeters (16 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C. (50 degrees F.)",
