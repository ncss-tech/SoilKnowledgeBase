The soils are usually moist but are dry for 70 to 90 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches within the 3-month period following the summer solstice.  Depth to moderately cemented sediments is 20 to 40 inches.  The content of angular rock fragments is 10 to 35 percent.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.  Depth to secondary carbonates is 20 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, chroma of 1 or 2 dry and moist.  It is silt loam or loam with 10 to 15 percent cobbles, 5 to 10 percent gravel and 18 to 27 percent clay.  It has weak to moderate platy, granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is clay with 40 to 60 percent clay with an increase in clay content of 15 percent or more (absolute) within a vertical distance of 1 inch at the upper boundary.  It has 0 to 10 percent stones, 15 to 20 percent cobbles and 5 to 10 percent gravel.  It has moderate coarse or medium prismatic and strong medium or fine subangular or angular blocky structure."

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sediments, tuffs, rhyolites and basalts.  The upper part has some influence of ash.  The mean winter temperature is 28 to 32 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 58 to 62 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches.  The frost-free period is 30 to 100 days."

Boardtree, Hankins, and Yawkey soils are in an association at the higher elevations mostly on north slopes.  Boardtree soils are ashy in the upper part of the profile.  Hankins soils lack an abrupt textural change.  Yawkey soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Ginser soils lack argillic horizons and have more than 35 percent coarse fragments as a weighted average in the control section.  Tub soils have a mean annual soil temperature of greater than 47 degrees F., and occur at slightly lower elevations or on south-facing slopes."
