  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Placerton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium or residuum derived from granite bedrock. These soils are on ridges, divides and sideslopes of hills and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
