  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Pokonahbe series would classify as a Natrargid if prismatic or columnar structure was present in the argillic horizon.  Field observations have shown blocky structure to be typical in the argillic horizon.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the profile are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon--0 to 20 cm (A1, A2).  Colors are too light for a mollic epipedon.\n1.1  Organic carbon assumed less than 0.6 percent.  (Based on nearby tests using Walkley-Black digestion method.\n2.  Argillic horizon--20 to 53 cm (2 BAtn and 2Btn horizons).  Clay increase from 10 percent in A2 horizon to 18 percent in 2BAtn horizon to 30 percent in 2Btn horizon is from field estimate.  Clay films were observed bridging mineral grains, on peds and in pores.\n2.1  Medium subangular and angular blocky structure observed.  Prismatic structure not evident.\n3.  Thermic temperature regime -- Mean annual soil temperature is 15 to 17.8 degrees C; this and other climatic characteristics are from available local climatic data and our preliminary data.\n4.  Mineralogy -- assumed mixed, no indication otherwise.\n5.  Particle size class -- fine-loamy based on hydrometer and field estimate of 20 to 53 cm control section.\n6.  Moisture regime - Aridic bordering on Xeric.  It is based on vegetation indicators, depth to water table, and our preliminary temperature/moisture data.\n6.1  Xeric subgroup -- Soil moisture control section is dry less than three fourths time that soil temperature at 50 cm is above 5 degrees C.  Our temperature/moisture transect data indicates this subgroup about 67 percent of the time.\n6.2  The moisture control section is dry throughout from April 15 to December 15.  It is moist throughout from January 1 to February 1.\n7.  The soil temperature exceeds 5 degrees C, from February 1 to January 1 (335 days).  Within this time period, the moisture control section is dry from May 1 to December 1 (215 days).\n7.1  The soil temperature exceeds 8.3 degrees C from March 1 to December 1 (275 days).  Within this time period, the moisture control section is dry from April 15 to December 1 (230 days).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
