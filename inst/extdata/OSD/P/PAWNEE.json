  "OVERVIEW": "The Pawnee series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in till.  Pawnee soils are on hillslopes of dissected till plains in Nebraska and Kansas Loess-Drift Hills, MLRA 106. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 864 millimeters (34 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

(upper 50 centimeters of Bt horizons)\nMollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 36 centimeters. (Ap, A and BA horizons)\nArgillic horizon: The zone from 36 to 114 centimeters. (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons)\nRedoximorphic concentrations: In the zone from 25 to 200 centimeters. (BA, Bt, BC, and C horizons)\nVertic features: The presence of slickensides in some pedons at 36 to 114 centimeters. (Bt horizons)\nEpisaturation: The zone of saturation at 30 to 91 centimeters. (Bt horizons)\nLRR=H\nModified format by LRM in 7/2006 to include metric conversion and change\npermeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.\nGJ 5/15/2008 Removed English units, updated competing series, defined mean annual temperature as mean annual air temperature and removed the term glacial from till.\n10/2008 JCR Added clay loam as a texture for the Bt and BC based on the\ncumulative NSSL lab data for the Pawnee series. Clay content was lowered to 37 for both horizons.\n7/2010 DJK Updated OSD to meet MO standards. Landform was changed from uplands to hillslopes on dissected till plains. MAP was changed from 76 cm to 864 mm. West-facing, 6% slope, and elevation of 372 meters was added to the typical pedon. Latitude was changed from 27 seconds to 26.9 and longitude from 5 seconds to 52.1 for type location.\nSoil moisture control section information was updated with statements describing an udic moisture regime. Episaturation was changed from March to May to February to April. Sand content of PSCS was lowered from 45 to 35%.\nIn ROC for the A 3 was added for chroma, clay % changed from 15 to 41 to 22 to 32, sand % changed from 18 to 30 to 15 to 35, and reaction from moderately acid to slightly acid to strongly acid to slightly acid.\nBA horizon was added into the ROC. In ROC for the Bt the sand content was change to 20 to 35 percent to match ROC for the control section. In ROC for the BC, value was changed from 5 or 6 moist or dry to 4 to 6 moist, 5 to 8 dry and clay % from 37 to 48 to 32 to 45\nIn ROC for the C horizon value was change from 5 moist to 4 to 7 moist and 5 or 6 dry to 5 to 8 dry. Textures of SCL and CL were eliminated and C was added. Clay % change from 15 to 40 to 27 to 40 and sand % from 10 to 25 to 25 to 35.\nCompeting series were edited by adding the statement \"within the series control section\" and Baileyville also has a litholigic discontinuity.\nIn geographic setting parent material was changed to clayey till from just till, landform from uplands to hillslopes on dissected till plains, elevation of 244 to 512 meters was added, MAP changed from 64 to 86 cm to 737 to 991 mm, and FFD from 160 to 180 to 163 to 186 days.\nGeographically associated soils were updated with Aksarben, Arisburg, Crete, Morrill, and Steinauer being deleted.\nUse and Vegetation was updated with crops being added and the statement on being irrigated deleted.  The PSCS was changed from 36 to 114 to 36 to 86 cm and upper 50 cm of Bt statement added.\nRedoximorphic concentrations bottom depth was changed from on down to actually say 200 cm. The possibility of slickensides being present was added to the vertic features and the sentence about clay percentages was deleted. Under additional data the NSSL pedons that have been correlated to Pawnee were added.\nAdditional data: Lab data is available for this pedon from the NSSL as pedon numbers: 58NE133001, 58NE133003, 71KS087003, 73NE109001, 80NE097001, 86KS085013, 86KS085014, 86KS085015, 86KS085022, 86KS117001, 86KS131001, 86KS131002, 86KS131003, 87KS131003, 88NE109001, S06KS131-001, and S06NE109-100."
