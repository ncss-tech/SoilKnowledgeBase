The soil moisture control section is dry for one-half to three-forths of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  Phosphate retention is 10 to 20 percent.  Volcanic glass is 70 to 90 percent.  The acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.3 to 0.7 percent.  The mollic colors throughout the profile are from the parent material.  Bedrock is at a depth of greater than 60 inches.  The particle size control section averages 25 to 35 percent gravel sized cinders, and 2 to 10 percent clay.  A Bk or Ck horizon is present in some pedons; when present carbonates are below 20 inches.\nThe A horizon hue is 5YR, 7.5YR and 10YR.  It has 35 to 60 percent cinders.  Clay content is 5 to 15 percent.\nThe C horizon hue is 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR.  It is gravelly loamy coarse sand, gravelly loamy sand and very gravelly loamy coarse sand.  Rock fragment content is 20 to 45 percent cinders.  Clay content is 2 to 10 percent.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline."
