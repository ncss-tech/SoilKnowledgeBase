  "OVERVIEW": "The Pioche series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks dominated by rhyolite, andesite and welded tuffs. Pioche soils are on hill and mountain side slopes. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Flatron, Ruckles and Waterbury soils have 50 to 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Coelho soils are less than 25 cm deep. Longcreek soils have slightly acid or neutral reaction in the A horizon and have 0.5 to 2 percent organic matter throughout the Bt horizon. Loomer soils have 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Radec soils are periodically moist between July and October. Vantage soils have Btq horizons."

It does not have moisture in the control section for 10 to 20 days cumulatively in the summer. The type location is moved from Lincoln County to White Pine County, Nevada, in 2004.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A and Bt1 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 5 to 38 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 38 cm (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 5 to 38 cm (Bt1, Bt2 horizons)."
