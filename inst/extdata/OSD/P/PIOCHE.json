Flatron, Ruckles and Waterbury soils have 50 to 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Coelho soils are less than 25 cm deep. Longcreek soils have slightly acid or neutral reaction in the A horizon and have 0.5 to 2 percent organic matter throughout the Bt horizon. Loomer soils have 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Radec soils are periodically moist between July and October. Vantage soils have Btq horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pioche soils are on hill and mountain side slopes. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks dominated by rhyolite, andesite and welded tuffs. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1,680 to 2,630 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."

It does not have moisture in the control section for 10 to 20 days cumulatively in the summer. The type location is moved from Lincoln County to White Pine County, Nevada, in 2004.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A and Bt1 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 5 to 38 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 38 cm (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 5 to 38 cm (Bt1, Bt2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Previous editors and authors include: HJB/JWM/CWL.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
