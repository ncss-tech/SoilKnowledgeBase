  "OVERVIEW": "The Purves series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in interbedded limestone and marl.  These soils are on gently sloping to steep upland divides with plane to convex surfaces.  Slopes are mainly 1 to 5 percent, but range from 1 to 40 percent.",
