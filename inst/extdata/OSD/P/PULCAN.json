  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:   Pulcan soils are on side slopes of old terraces, at elevations of 1,680 to 1,985 meters. Slopes are 15 to 30 percent.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from tertiary mudstone, sandstone, and interbedded tuff.  The summers are hot and dry and the winters are cold and wet.  Precipitation is mostly snow in winter months and rain during spring months.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 95 to 120 days."

Puett soils lack an argillic horizon and are shallow over tertiary sediments. Uhaldi soils have a gravelly clay loam argillic horizon and a mollic epipedon."
