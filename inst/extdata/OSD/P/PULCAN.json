  "OVERVIEW": "Pulcan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from mudstone.  Pulcan soils are on terrace side slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from tertiary mudstone, sandstone, and interbedded tuff.  The summers are hot and dry and the winters are cold and wet.  Precipitation is mostly snow in winter months and rain during spring months.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 95 to 120 days."
