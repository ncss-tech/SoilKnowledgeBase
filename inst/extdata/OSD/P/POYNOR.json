Reaction is extremely acid to slightly acid, but can be neutral where limed.\nThe BE horizon, where present, and the Bt horizons have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.  These horizons are the very gravelly or extremely gravelly analogues of silty clay loam, silt loam, loam or clay loam and extremely acid to moderately acid, but can range as high as neutral where limed.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is clay or silty clay, or their gravelly analogs. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe 3Bt horizon, where present, has hue of 10R to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 8 with gray seams. It is very gravelly to extremely gravelly clay. Reaction is extrememly acid to strongly acid."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Poynor soils are on narrow ridgetops and steep side slopes.  These soils formed in gravelly colluvium weathered from dolostone or limestone and the underlying cleyey residuum weathered from shale.  Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches."

Clarksville and Coulstone soils are loamy-skeletal and are on similar positions.  Captina and Wilderness soils have fragipans and are on the more gently sloping wider ridgetops.  Doniphan, Gepp, and Macedonia soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the upper part of the argillic horizon and are on similar positions."
