  "OVERVIEW": "The Pollard series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from altered sedimentary and extrusive igneous rocks.  Pollard soils are on hill slopes and toeslopes, foot slopes, saddles, ridges, and side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

It is loam or gravelly loam with 5 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry in the upper part, and 5 dry in the lower part, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and 5 to 7 dry.  It is clay, silty clay, or clay loam and has 35 to 50 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon and up to 50 percent in the BCt horizon or below the control section in some pedons. In some pedons there is 5 to 10 percent small black concretions."
