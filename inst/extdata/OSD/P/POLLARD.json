It is loam or gravelly loam with 5 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry in the upper part, and 5 dry in the lower part, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and 5 to 7 dry.  It is clay, silty clay, or clay loam and has 35 to 50 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon and up to 50 percent in the BCt horizon or below the control section in some pedons. In some pedons there is 5 to 10 percent small black concretions."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils are at elevations of 800 to 4,000 feet.  The soils formed in alluvium and colluvium weathered from sedimentary, altered sedimentary and extrusive igneous rocks.  The climate is characterized by warm moist to wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 30 to 60 inches but may range to 100 inches in the high winter rainfall interior mountains of Curry County, Oregon.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 200 days."
