  "OVERVIEW": "The Peola series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in loess and slope alluvium, and colluvium from basalt on plateaus and hillslopes.  Slopes are 3 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 18 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a calcic horizon is 24 to 34 inches.  Depth to a lithic contact with basalt is 30 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 49 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 22 to 30 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and averages 5 to 25 percent basalt fragments and durinodes.  The mollic epipedon is 24 to 34 inches thick and includes the entire solum above the calcic horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, gravelly silt loam, or gravelly silty clay loam.\nThe 2Bqk horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry and moist.  It is very gravelly loam, extremely cobbly loam, or very cobbly loam.  The coarse fragments include 20 to 35 percent lime-silica cemented durinodes and lime-silica coated basalt fragments.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
