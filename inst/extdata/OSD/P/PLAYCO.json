The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F.  The upper 7 to 14 inches of the solum has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.65 to 1.00 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron of more than 2.0 percent and 15 bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent on air dried samples.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7 moist and 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 0 through 2 moist or dry.  There is tonguing of this horizon into the Bhs horizon in some pedons.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bhs horizon is 7 to 12 inches thick and has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist or dry.  It is single grain or has weak subangular blocky structure.  It is ashy loamy sand or ashy sandy loam.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe 2Bs and 2BCs horizons have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist.  Texture is very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam or extremely gravelly loam.  They are strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry and 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist or dry.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly loam,, or extremely gravelly loam.  It averages 30 to 50 percent pebbles and 10 to 20 percent cobbles.  The coarse fragments are generally colluvial in the upper portion of this horizon and residual from bedrock in the lower portion.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Conto, Nimue and Springsteen series.  Conto soils form in volcanic ash over glacial till.  Conto soils have an ashy sandy loam or ashy silt loam mantle.  Nimue soils are similar and need more review for separation; they have a mean annual soil temperature of 39 to 42 degrees F.  Springsteen series are moderately deep to bedrock."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Playco soils are on mountain slopes at elevations of 2,500 to 3,600 feet, the lower limit of the elevation range being on northerly and easterly exposures.  Slopes range from 5 to 90 percent.  The slopes are dissected in some areas.  Playco soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice mixed with colluvium from extrusive igneous rocks.  The climate is maritime influenced with cold, wet winters, and cool, moist summers.  The mean January temperature is about 27 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is 75 to 90 inches, with a considerable portion of this being in the form of snow.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 110 to 130 days."

Cattcreek soils are cindery over medial-skeletal.  Cotteral soils are cindery over medial.  Foss soils are medial over loamy-skeletal.  Haywire and Nagrom soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Pitcher soils are frigid.  Spukwush soils are ashy over loamy."
