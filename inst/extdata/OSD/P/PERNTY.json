Cleavage, Cropper, Grosschat, and Mascamp soils have more than 50 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Cleavmor soils have mollic epipedons that are 36 to 50 cm thick.  Gaciba soils have 16 to 24 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Horsetrack and Shalper soils have lithic contacts shallower than 36 cm.  Slatter soils are very shallow and have 18 to 25 percent clay and 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pernty soils are on mountains, hills and lava plateaus.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as rhyolite, welded tuff, and basalt or metamorphic rocks such as chert.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,400 to 2,625 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
