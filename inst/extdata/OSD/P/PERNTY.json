  "OVERVIEW": "The Pernty series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic or metamorphic rocks.  Pernty soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

Gaciba soils have 16 to 24 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Horsetrack and Shalper soils have lithic contacts shallower than 36 cm.  Slatter soils are very shallow and have 18 to 25 percent clay and 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."

Elevations range from 1,400 to 2,625 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
