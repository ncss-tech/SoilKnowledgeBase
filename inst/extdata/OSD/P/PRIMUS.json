  "OVERVIEW": "The Primus series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and reworked glacial drift on debris aprons, valley walls, and fan terraces.  Slopes are 10 to 40 percent on debris aprons and valley walls and 5 to 15 percent on fan terraces.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,450 millimeters.  The mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
