Uneroded pedons are assumed to have an E or BE horizon 3 to 5 inches thick.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Fe depletions with chroma of 2 are in the lower part. It is clay loam or clay. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part and strongly acid to neutral in the lower part.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 1 to 6. It is clay or clay loam in the upper part and clay loam or loam in the lower part. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Winnegan soils have value of 4 or more in the Ap horizon or have an A horizon with value of 2 or 3 that is less than 5 inches or less thick. Gara soils are fine-loamy and do not have a saturated layer in the upper 40 inches of the profile."

Armstrong and Lamoni soils formed in paleosols and have 2 chroma Fe depletions within 10 inches of the top of the argillic horizon. Pershing soils formed in loess and have 2 chroma Fe depletions within 10 inches of the top of the argillic horizon. These soils are higher on the slope than Purdin soils."
