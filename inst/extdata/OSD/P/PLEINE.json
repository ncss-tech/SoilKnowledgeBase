  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from about 18 to 36 inches.  Cobbles in the Oa horizon ranges from 5 to 35 percent, and cobble content in the Bg, Bw and C horizon ranges from 4 to 15 percent. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the Oa, Bg and Bw horizons and from 15 to 40 percent in the C horizon. Stones and boulders range from 1 to 15 percent throughout the pedon.  The particle size control section averages between 10 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1. Some pedons have an A horizon with hue of 5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam, silt loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or the cobbly analogues of these textures. Reaction of the Oa or A horizons is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or the cobbly analogues of these textures. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or the cobbly analogues of these textures. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or the gravelly or very gravelly analogues of these textures. Reaction is moderately or slightly acid."

Burnham soils are underlain by dense glacial till within depths of 5 to 18 inches.  Nahma soils have limestone bedrock within 40 inches.  Peacham soils are underlain by dense glacial till within depths of 10 to 24 inches. Sabattis soils have hues yellower than 5YR in the lower third of the series control section. Sago soils do not have coarse fragments.  Waucedah soils have dominantly have hues yellower than 5YR in the lower solum and substratum and do not have coarse fragments. Witbeck soils have hues yellower than 10YR in the lower half of the series control section and formed in grayer till containing a high proportion of slates."
