  "OVERVIEW": "The Polum series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone, dolomite, and calcareous shale.  Polum soils are on side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
