These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone, dolomite, sandstone, chert and calcareous shale.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 2,290 to 2,750 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 360to 410 mm mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 50 to 80 days."
