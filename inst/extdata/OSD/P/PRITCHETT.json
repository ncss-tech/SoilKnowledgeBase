Everman soils have albic horizons and have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section. Flygare and Red Spur soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick and have less than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizons. Lucky Star soils have albic horizons that tongue into very cobbly sandy clay loam argillic horizons. Roundy soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the argillic horizon. Scave and Red Spur soils have hue of 5YR and 2.5YR in the argillic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING: Pritchett soils are on steep or very steep mountain slopes at elevations of 7,000 to 8,900 feet. They formed in local colluvium and residuum from sandstone and quartzite. The climate is moist subhumid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 30 inches. The mean annual temperature ranges from 36 to 40 degrees F. Frost-free period is 70 to 90 days."
