    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Pylon soils are sedimentary uplands, hills and ridges.  Elevations are 2,700 to 5,200 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  They formed in residuum from interbedded shale and sandstone or alluvium over shale.  The climate is cool, semiarid, continental.  It is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm summers.  The mean annual air temperature is 40 to 46 degrees F., with a mean summer temperature of 60 to 70 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 16 inches, most of which falls during spring and early summer.  The (32 degree F.) growing season is 105 to 135 days."
