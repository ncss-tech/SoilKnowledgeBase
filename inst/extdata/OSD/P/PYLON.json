  "OVERVIEW": "The Pylon series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from interbedded shale and sandstone or in alluvium over shale.  These soils are on sedimentary uplands, hills and ridges.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
