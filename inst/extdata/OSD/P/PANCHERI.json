The parent material is mostly loess, but in a few places, there are indications of water influence on the deposits.  The climate is semiarid with dry summers.  Mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches, including 2 to 4 feet of snowfall.  Mean frost-free season is 55 to 120 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The previous official series description states that  some pedons have an SAR of up to 30.  Those pedons with high sodium accumulations would now classify as Sodic Xeric Haplocalcids.  There are also many pedons mapped as Pancheri that contain 20 percent or more firm or very firm nodules.  These pedons would now classify as Petronodic  Haplocalcids.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon -\nCambic horizon - the zone from 5 to 13 inches (Bw horizon).\nCalcic horizon - the zone from 13 to 71 inches (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3, and 2Bky  horizons).\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 28 inches (part of  the Bw, and the Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  S94ID-011-005\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
