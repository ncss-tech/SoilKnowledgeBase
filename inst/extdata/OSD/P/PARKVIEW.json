  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 41 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is about 51 degrees F.  Usually the solum extends to the bedrock, but thin C horizons occur in some pedons.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above the bedrock and are mainly 10 to 24 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically extremely stony sandy clay loam, loam or clay loam, but averages 18 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 45 percent silt, and 15 to 75 percent sand.  This horizon ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon, if present, has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  It ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline."

Bowen, Buena Vista, Elwood, Nathrop, and Woodhall soils have a lithic contact at depth of less than 40 inches.  Ess, Fourmile, Packer, Stuckcreek, Tahquats, Thiel, Quander, Mullinville, Norriston, Hoodle, and Libeg soils lack a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Winada soils are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and C horizons and have continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Parkview soils are on gently to steeply sloping upland hills and ridges where sedimentary rock occur relatively near to the surface.  Slopes typically range from 2 to 20 percent or more.  These soils formed in noncalcareous, moderately fine textured parent sediments weathered residually from underlying sandy shales, sandstones, and loamstones.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 18 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer.  The average annual temperature is 36 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 52 degrees F."

Therefore, the series is reclassifed to an Ustollic Haplocryalf.  Only the classification was updated.  5/2005\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
