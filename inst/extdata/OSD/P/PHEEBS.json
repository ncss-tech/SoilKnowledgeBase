  "OVERVIEW": "The Pheebs series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Pheebs soils are on flood plains and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 15 and 50 cm from December through June (very shallow and moderately deep free water occurrence classes). Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent. Water tables fluctuate with irrigation and to some extent with fluctuation in adjacent river channels.  These soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for brief periods between December and May."
