Elevations range from 1,100 to 1,800 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 15 and 50 cm from December through June (very shallow and moderately deep free water occurrence classes). Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent. Water tables fluctuate with irrigation and to some extent with fluctuation in adjacent river channels.  These soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for brief periods between December and May."
