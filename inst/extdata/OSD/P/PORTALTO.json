  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Portalto series consists of very deep, moderately permeable, moderately well drained soils that have formed in sandy and loamy sediments of Quaternary age.  These nearly level to moderately sloping soils are on mounds and ridges on strand plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is 22.2 degrees C (72 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 in).",
