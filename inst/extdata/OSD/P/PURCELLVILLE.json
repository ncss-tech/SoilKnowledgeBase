  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Purcellville series are very deep and well drained.  They formed in residuum derived from diorite, biotite schist, and greenstone schist in the Blue Ridge Uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.",
