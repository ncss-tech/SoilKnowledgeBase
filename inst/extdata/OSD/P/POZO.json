  "OVERVIEW": "The Pozo series consists of Humic Gley soils without textural B horizons but having prominent hardpans and developed from medium and moderately fine textured alluvium largely from granitic source.  They occur on nearly level slopes in basin areas under annual grass-forb and saline alkali grass and shrub vegetation.  The Pozo soils characteristically have dark gray, noncalcareous, and moderate in organic matter in the A horizon overlying nearly white calcareous upper C horizons and strongly lime silica cemented hardpans at moderate depths.  Excess salts, alkali, or both are typically found in the profile.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The A1 horizon color may be gray (10YR 5/1) to dark gray (10YR 4/1) and the thickness is variable.  Textures of the A1 horizon are medium and moderately fine, mainly silt loams and clay loams.  In the case of leveled and farmed ares, the A1 horizon may be entirely removed.  The hardpan layer is variable as to depth, thickness, and hardiness.  Several successive hardpan layers alternating with more friable material may occur."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nearly level basin areas cut by occasional steep-sided drainage channels. The Pozo soils occur at elevations of 100 to 150 feet in a semiarid mesothermal climate having a mean annual precipitation of 8 to 9 inches with hot, dry summers and cool moist winters; an average January temperature of 45 degrees F.; and average July temperature of 82 degrees F. with a mean annual temperature of 63 degrees F., and an average frost free season of 250 to 280 days.  The Pozo series is mapped in the basin area along the east side of the San Joaquin River, California."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The Pozo soils occur in the same general area as the Columbia, El Peco, Fresno, Merced, Rossi and Temple soils, and they most nearly resemble the El Peco and Fresno series.  The El Peco soils have very pale brown surface layers low in organic matter, but the profiles are otherwise similar to those of the Pozo series.  The Fresno soils have surface soil characteristics similar to those of the El Peco series but have moderately developed B horizons."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",

Pumping has altered the natural drainage considerably and most areas are now somewhat poorly (imperfectly) drained; very slow to slow surface runoff and very slow permeability. The water table is now well below the profile and no longer has any effect on the soil in most places."
