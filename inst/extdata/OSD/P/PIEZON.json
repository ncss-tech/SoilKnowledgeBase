  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 62 to 64 degrees F.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.   Depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 6 to 16 inches.  The calcic horizon contains 15 to 25 percent calcium carbonate.  The soil is commonly calcareous throughout.  The particle-size control section is a loam, silt loam, or channery loam and averages 18 to 27 percent clay, 30 to 55 percent silt and 25 to 50 percent sand with less than 35 percent fine and coarser sand.  Content of channery fragments averages 0 to 20 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue ot 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and a chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and a chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe Bk horizons have hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and a chroma of 3 or 4."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTINGS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTINGS: Piezon soils are on hillslopes and plateaus.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in residuum derived from siltstone and fine grained sandstone.  Elevation is 6,100 to 7,700 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 15 inches.  In areas where the mean annual precipitation is less than 11 inches, the soil receives additional moisture due to snow drift accumulations on the soil.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 75 to 100 days."
