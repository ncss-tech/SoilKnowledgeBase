  "OVERVIEW": "The Polich series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and stream alluvium derived from sandstone, granite, and limestone. Polich soils are on valley floors. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
