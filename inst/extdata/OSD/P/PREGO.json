  "OVERVIEW": "The Prego series consist of very deep, well drained soils formed in noncalcareous alluvium.  Prego soils are on relict stream terraces and relict alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
