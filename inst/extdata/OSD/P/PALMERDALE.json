The coarse fragment content ranges from 40 to 90 percent.  Sandstone, shale, and siltstone fragments range in size from 1/2 inch to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon dominantly has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 6.  The fine earth fraction is loam, sandy loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, values of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Mottles in these colors are common.  Texture of the fine earth fraction in the C horizon is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Palmerdale soils are on nearly level to very steep slopes.  They make up the majority of mine spoil areas where coal mining operations have taken place.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 60 percent, depending on whether the spoils have been smoothed or how they were stocked.  Where smoothed, slopes are gently and fairly uniform over large tracts.  Near the type location the mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 54 inches."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  In Alabama, Palmerdale soils have been classified as a land type in previous soil surveys.  Most very new stripmine spoil material has voids between shale fragments, more nearly fitting the concept of the fragmental textural family.  These materials soon compact.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon:  the zone from the surface to a depth of 5 inches"
