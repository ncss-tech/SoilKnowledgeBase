  "OVERVIEW": "The Powlow series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Powlow soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
