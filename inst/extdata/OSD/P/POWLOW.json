    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Powlow soils are on fan remnants.  They typically occur on shoulder positions.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,710 to 2,000 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
