    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Paynepeak soils are on  mountains. They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from glacial debris, volcanic ash, andesitic tuff and similar volcanic rocks. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 5,200 to 9,000 feet. The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 50 inches, most of which comes as snow. The mean annual temperature is 39 to 42 degrees F. The frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
