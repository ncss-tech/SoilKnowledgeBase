  "OVERVIEW": "The Paynepeak series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from glacial debris, volcanic ash and andesitic tuff and similar volcanic rocks. Paynepeak soils are on mountains. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
