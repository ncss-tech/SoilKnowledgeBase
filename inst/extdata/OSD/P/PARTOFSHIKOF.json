  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: MAST ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F. The thickness of the solum ranges from 14 to 39 inches. Phosphorous retention exceeds 85 percent. Moist bulk density is less than 0.90 grams/cc. 15 bar water content moist ranges from 30 to 100 percent (on field moist samples) in the solum. The coarse fragment content in the control section ranges from 0 to 15 percent gravel size pumice. Reaction increases with depth, ranging from extremely acid to neutral.\nThe combined thickness of the O horizons range from 3 to 12 inches, but is normally less than 8 inches.\nThe E horizon has hue from 5YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma from 1 to 3. Texture is commonly silt loam but ranges to loamy sand. A Bh horizon, up to 10 inches thick, is present in some pedons.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 2.5 or 3, and chroma from 1 to 4. Texture is commonly silt loam but ranges to loam. Thin stratas of very fine sandy loam and fine sandy loam occur in some pedons. Prominent or distinct mottles are often present in the lower part of the horizon.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value from 3 to 5, and chroma from 4 to 8. Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent gravel size pumice. Prominent or distinct mottles commonly are present.\nThe 2C and 3C horizons are composed of several strata of ash deposits. Color is variegated, texture ranges from loamy sand to silt loam, and coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 20 percent gravel size pumice."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil include: an albic horizon from 0 to 1 inch; spodic horizons from 1 to 32 inches; andic soil properties throughout the soil; cryic temperature regime; assumed moist 15 bar water content between 30 and 100 percent.\nNo lab data is available for this pedon. Andic soil properties are assumed based on field morphology and lab data for the associated Sukoi series (NSSL S87AK-220-010).\nThis series could classify as a Typic Cryaquod under the 1991 revised Spodosol criteria. This soil, however, does not exhibit the saturated conditions typical of an Aquod which is reflected in the forest productivity. Redoximorphic features are present lower in the spodic horizon and the soil exhibits the characteristics of somewhat poor drainage. It is assumed the soil is not saturated to the surface nor does the capillary fringe extend to the surface during the year.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
