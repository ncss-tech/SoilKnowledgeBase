Cucamungo soils have 20 to 30 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Grandridge soils have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days during the summer due to convection storms.  Pinew soils have rock fragments which are volcanic rocks and have paralithic materials of weathered tuff or andesite in the series control section.  Quopant soils have 2C horizons below the argillic horizon and have paralithic materials of weathered ash-flow tuff in the series control section.  Trailamp soils are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Elevations are 2,130 to 2,870 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 450 mm. The mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C.  The frost-free season is 50 to 70 days."
