  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinwheeler series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from granitic rocks. The Pinwheeler soils are on mountains. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 400 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",

Grandridge soils have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days during the summer due to convection storms.  Pinew soils have rock fragments which are volcanic rocks and have paralithic materials of weathered tuff or andesite in the series control section.  Quopant soils have 2C horizons below the argillic horizon and have paralithic materials of weathered ash-flow tuff in the series control section.  Trailamp soils are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
