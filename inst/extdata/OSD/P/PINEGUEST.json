  "OVERVIEW": "The Olathe series consists of very deep, well to somewhat excessively well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and/or residuum derived from granite bedrock.  Pineguest soils are on gently to moderately sloping alluvial fans or glacial outwash terraces with slopes of 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.",
