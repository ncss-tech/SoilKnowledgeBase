  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 20 to 50 inches thick.  Organic carbon ranges from 1 to 3 percent in the A1 horizon but decreases rapidly but uniformly with increasing depth. The soil is 60 to 80 percent base saturated. These soils have a very low volume change on wetting and drying and have very hard semi-cemented consistence when air dry in the horizons of low organic matter content. packing patterns of sand grains in the soil fabric tend to be cubical or rhomboidal.  Rock fragments range from about 15 to 35 percent, most of which are fine and very fine angular granite fragments. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 degrees to 46 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature from 40 degrees to 46 degrees F. with an O horizon at least 4 inches thick and good crown cover. The A2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It usually has platy primary structure but has subangular blocky or granular structure in some pedons. This horizon is hard or slightly hard and medium or slightly acid. The B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5. The lamellae in the horizon are principally sandy clay loam or light clay loam, but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 5 to 30 percent, and sand from 45 to 70 percent with more than 35 percent fine sand, and with a high percentage of medium and coarse angular granite fragments. Oriented clay films occur in some lamellae. This horizon is medium or slightly acid. The C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR. It is slightly or medium acid."

Tex soils have less than 60 percent base saturation in some part of the argillic horizon and contain more coarse and medium angular sand and fine granitic gravel."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  These soils are on gently to moderately sloping alluvial fans or glacial outwash terraces in which the parent material has been derived principally from granite bedrock. Slopes usually range from 2 to 20 percent. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 22 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months. The average annual temperature is 34 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is 52 degrees F."
