(Latitude:  40 degrees, 14 minutes, 52 seconds; longitude:  108 degrees, 13 minutes, 39 seconds)\nRANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS;  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 64 to 66 degrees F.  The moisture control section is usually dry in all parts in July and moist in some parts in June and for 45 cumulative days in the period August 1 through October 30.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 50 percent clay with 15 to 30 percent fine sand and coarser.  Depth to the base of the cambic horizon is 12 to 30 inches.  A horizon with a concentration of salts and a sodium adsorption ratio of 8 to 16 occurs at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is moderately alkaline (pH 8.0 to 8.4).\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is strongly alkaline (pH 8.4 to 8.8).  Electrical conductivity is 0.1 to 0.5 mmhos/cm.  Sodium adsorption ratio is 2 to 8.  It is clay, clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bn horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is strongly alkaline and very strongly alkaline (pH 8.8 to 9.6) with at least one subhorizon having a pH above 9.0.  Electrical conductivity is 0.3 to 1.5.  Sodium adsorption ratio is 8 to 16.  It is clay, clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is moderately alkaline and strongly alkaline (pH 8.4 to 9.0).  Electrical conductivity is 0.1 to 0.5 mmhos/cm.  Sodium Adsorption Ratio is 2 to 8.  Texture is clay, clay loam or silty clay loam.  A Cn horizon occurs in some pedons."
