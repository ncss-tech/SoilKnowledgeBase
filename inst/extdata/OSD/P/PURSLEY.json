  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Organic matter decreases irregularly with depth or is more than 0.3 percent at a depth of 50 inches below the surface.  Bedding planes are visible within 40 inches of the surface.  The soil is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and calcareous.\nThe Ap or A1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 2 to 4.   Chroma of 2 is assumed to be inherited from the high lime content.  Where present, the B horizon is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Clay content of the 10- to 40-inch control section ranges from 18 to 35 percent, with more than 15 percent material coarser than very fine sand.\nThe C horizons are stratified with sandy to clayey textures, but averages a loam or clay loam.  In some pedons buried darker colored clay is below a depth of 40 inches."

Easpur and Spur soils have hue dominantly redder than 7.5YR.  Asa and Asher soils have fine-silty control sections.  Bippus, Bosque, Gageby, and Gowen soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick.  Colorado soils do not have mollic epipedons and have hue of 5YR and redder.  Toyah soils have an electrical conductivity of more than 2 dS/m within the control section and are dry for longer periods of time."

The soil formed in loamy calcareous sediments.  Flooding occurs at intervals of 1 or more times a year to once about every 5 years.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 70 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 40 inches.  Frost free days range from 240 to 280 days and elevation ranges from 150 to 750 feet. Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 46 to 64."
