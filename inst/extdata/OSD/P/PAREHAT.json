  "OVERVIEW": "The Parehat series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on bottomlands, alluvial fans and low terraces.  Parehat soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources influenced by loess.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
