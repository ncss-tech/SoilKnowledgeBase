  "OVERVIEW": "The Protivin series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in 14 to 28 inches of loamy sediments and the underlying glacial till. Protivin soils are on long convex ridges and side slopes on uplands. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
