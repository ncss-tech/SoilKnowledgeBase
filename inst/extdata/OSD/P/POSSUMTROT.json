  "OVERVIEW": "The Possumtrot series consists of very deep, well drained soils on low stream terraces and flood plains. These soils formed in loamy stream alluvium. Permeability is moderately rapid. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",
