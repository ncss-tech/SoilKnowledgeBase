Rock fragment content throughout the soil is less than 5 percent by volume. Stones cover from 0 to 0.1 percent of the surface in most areas but may range up to 3 percent.

It is typically silt loam but is very fine sandy loam in some areas.  It has weak or moderate fine or medium granular structure. Moist consistence is very friable or friable. It is slightly sticky and slightly plastic.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.

Typically the C horizon is massive but some pedons exhibit weak to strong, fine to coarse subangular or angular blocks, thick or very thick plates, or moderate or strong coarse or very coarse prisms, all of which are considered inherited from the parent material.  Moist consistence is friable or firm. It is slightly or moderately sticky and slightly to very plastic.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no series in the same family. Soil series in related families include Boothbay, Lamoine, Pemi, Roundabout, Scantic, Swanton, Swanville and Whately.  Boothbay soils lack a gleyed horizon within 50 cm of the mineral soil surface. Lamoine soils have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Pemi soils lack a horizon with a moist value and chroma of 3 or more between the mineral surface horizon and a depth of 75 cm and have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Roundabout soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Scantic soils have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and lack a horizon with a moist value and chroma of 3 or more between the mineral surface horizon and a depth of 75 cm.  Swanton soils have less than 18 percent clay in the upper part of the particle size control section and 35 percent or more clay in the lower part.  Swanville soils have a gleyed horizon, the upper boundary of which is immediately underlying the mineral surface horizon or within 25 cm of the mineral surface.  Whately soils have less than 18 percent clay in the upper part of the particle size control section and 35 percent or more clay in the lower part and lack a horizon with a moist value and chroma of 3 or more between the mineral surface horizon and a depth of 75 cm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Pushaw soils are on lake plains and marine terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  The soils formed in glaciomarine and glaciolacustrine sediments of Wisconsin age.  The climate is humid and cool temperate. The mean annual precipitation is 1010 to 1270 mm. The mean annual air temperature is 4 to 8 degrees C. The frost-free period is 110 to 160 days.  Elevations typically range from 1.5 to 91 meters above sea level, but may range to as high as 366 meters in river valleys of north central Maine."

The very poorly drained Biddeford soils are on lower elevations and depressions.  Pushaw soils are in a drainage sequence with Boothbay and Swanville soils. The somewhat poorly drained Colonel and the moderately well drained Dixfield soils formed in dense glacial till and are in nearby higher, slightly convex positions on the landscape. The very poorly drained Wonsqueak soils are in depressions and formed in organic material."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series recognizes somewhat poorly drained Aeric Epiaquepts formed in fine-silty glaciolacustrine or glaciomarine deposits.  These soils were formerly mapped as Boothbay, which had a dual drainage class of moderately well and somewhat poorly drained.  The series is named for Pushaw Lake, a large lake in south-central Penobscot County, Maine.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 18 cm (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon  the zone from 18 to 66 cm (Bw, BC and BCg horizons).\n3. Aeric feature  matrix color chroma of 3 at 18 to 38 cm (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\n4. Aquic feature  redox depletions with a chroma of 2 or less at 25 cm below the soil surface, and matrix chroma of 2 due to reduced conditions at 38 to 46 cm (BCg horizon).\n5. Episaturation - a perched water table above the C horizon\nADDITIONAL DATA: Primary characterization data from pedon 05NO231, samples\n05NO1348-1351 from Penobscot County, Maine, SSL, Lincoln, NE, 12/05.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
