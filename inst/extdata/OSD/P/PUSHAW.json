  "OVERVIEW": "The Pushaw series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in glaciolacustrine or glaciomarine deposits on lake plains and marine terraces. Estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the surface and moderately high to moderately low in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the surface and moderately slow or slow in underlying material. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1120 mm. Mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

Swanton soils have less than 18 percent clay in the upper part of the particle size control section and 35 percent or more clay in the lower part.

The very poorly drained Biddeford soils are on lower elevations and depressions.  Pushaw soils are in a drainage sequence with Boothbay and Swanville soils. The somewhat poorly drained Colonel and the moderately well drained Dixfield soils formed in dense glacial till and are in nearby higher, slightly convex positions on the landscape. The very poorly drained Wonsqueak soils are in depressions and formed in organic material."

These soils were formerly mapped as Boothbay, which had a dual drainage class of moderately well and somewhat poorly drained.  The series is named for Pushaw Lake, a large lake in south-central Penobscot County, Maine.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 18 cm (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon  the zone from 18 to 66 cm (Bw, BC and BCg horizons).\n3. Aeric feature  matrix color chroma of 3 at 18 to 38 cm (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\n4. Aquic feature  redox depletions with a chroma of 2 or less at 25 cm below the soil surface, and matrix chroma of 2 due to reduced conditions at 38 to 46 cm (BCg horizon).\n5. Episaturation - a perched water table above the C horizon\nADDITIONAL DATA: Primary characterization data from pedon 05NO231, samples\n05NO1348-1351 from Penobscot County, Maine, SSL, Lincoln, NE, 12/05.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
