  "OVERVIEW": "The Parran series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Parran soils are on lake plains and basin-floor remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",

The great group of Haplosalids is a possible revision of the taxonomic classification.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  A pedon of Parran is sampled for full characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as pedon ID S08NV001001 (pedon # 08N0488).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
