Elevations range from 1150 to 1710 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."

Churchill soils are moderately well drained, have natric horizons, and formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits on basin-floor remnants.  Pelic soils are sandy, very poorly drained, and occur on flood plains."

A seasonal high water table is present between 60 and 100 cm (moderately deep free water occurrence class) for at least one month in normal years.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common (November through March)."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (The Az and part of the Bzy horizons).\nSalic horizon - The zone from 13 to 46 cm (Bzy horizon).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 61 and 100 cm for at least one month in normal years.\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (parts of the Bzy and C horizons).\nFurther study on depths and periods of endosaturation are needed on this soil to better define soil properties for interpretations and taxonomic classification.  The great group of Haplosalids is a possible revision of the taxonomic classification.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  A pedon of Parran is sampled for full characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as pedon ID S08NV001001 (pedon # 08N0488).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
