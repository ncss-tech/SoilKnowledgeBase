  "STATES": "AZ,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Parkwash series consists of very shallow to shallow, somewhat excessively drained, very rapidly permeable soils that formed in residuum and reworked eolian sand deposits derived from Navajo Formation sandstone. Parkwash soils are a sand mantle located in blowout areas, sand sheets and dunes on structural benches, and climbing dunes. Slope ranges 2 to 50 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
