  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 44 degrees F., and average summer temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F.  A lithic or paralithic contact occurs at depths of 40 to 60 inches or more.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 20 to 50 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in a major part of the solum and any C horizon and are mainly 3 to 24 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is strongly or moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is strongly through slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 5.  It is heavy clay loam or light clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  This horizon is neutral through strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay.  Fine sandy loam is common in some pedons that lack continuity.  This horizon is neutral to strongly acid."

In addition, Chedsey soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the Bt horizon.  Goldhill soils have carbonates at depths of 25 to 60 inches.  Harkness soils have sola of 60 inches or more.  Herd soils lack E/B horizons and have sola thicker than 50 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pagosa soils are on hills, mountainsides, and valley sides.  Slopes typically range from 3 to 65 percent.  Elevation is 8,000 to 9,500 feet.  These soils formed in thick noncalcareous medium to moderately fine textured materials originating as glacial till or similar deposits.  The mean annual precipitation is about 22 to 28 inches; mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.; and mean summer temperature is 54 degrees F."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - from 0 to 6 inches (A horizon)\nAlbic horizon - from 6 to 13 inches (E horizon)\nGlossic horizon - from 13 to 22 inches (E/B horizon)\nArgillic horizon - from 13 to 30 inches (E/B and Bt horizons)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 22 to 30 inches (Bt horizon)\nUpdate mapping of the area having the type location indicates a frigid temperature regime and a typic-ustic or udic-ustic moisture regime. This new soil climate is consistent with the ponderosa pine/Gamble oak forest community that was originally correlated to the Pagosa series. It is likely this series will be reclassified to a Udic or Typic Haplustalf in the near future.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
