  "OVERVIEW": "The Peloncillo series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from volcanic rocks. Peloncillo soils are on dissected alluvial fans and have slopes of 1 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
