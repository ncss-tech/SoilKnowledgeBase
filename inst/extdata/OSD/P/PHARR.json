  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 80 inches.  Secondary lime in the form of films and threads occurs at depths of 15 to 30 inches.  Salinity ranges from 0 to 8 mmhos/cm and increases with depth.  The soil is noncalcareous in up to 40 percent of the matrix to depths of 28 inches in some pedons.\nThe A horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), brown (10YR 5/3), or dark brown (10YR 4/3).  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy loam.\nThe B horizon is grayish brown (10YR 5/2), brown (10YR 5/3; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4), or pale brown (10YR 6/3).  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam and the clay content ranges from 21 to 33 percent.\nThe C horizon is very pale brown (10YR 7/3), pale brown (10YR 6/3), or light gray (10YR 7/2). It is sandy clay loam or clay loam, with 3 to 25 percent by volume weakly cemented concretions and soft bodies of calcium carbonate."

Pernitas soils have sola thinner than 40 inches.  Runge, Tela, Weesatche, and Willacy soils are noncalcareous in the upper part of the solum.  Brennan soils lack mollic epipedons.  Ost soils have mean annual soil temperatures less than 72 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pharr soils are on nearly level to gently sloping deltas or coastal terraces.  Slopes are mostly less than 2 percent, but range up to about 5 percent.  The soil formed in thick, moderately fine textured calcareous sediments of alluvial or eolian origin.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 32 inches, and the mean annual temperatures are 70 degrees to about 74 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 28 to 38."
