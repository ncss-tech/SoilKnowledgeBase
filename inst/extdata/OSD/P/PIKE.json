  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pike soils are on summits, shoulders and backslopes of eskers, crevasse fillings, and outwash plains. Slope gradients are dominantly 0 to 6 percent, but can range up to 50 percent. They formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying paleosol in loamy outwash. The other silty material (2Bt horizons) consists of a mixing zone between the loess and the underlying outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 170 to 210 days. Elevation ranges from 152 to 244 meters (500 to 800 feet) above mean sea level."

The Parke soils have less than 102 cm (40 inches) of loess are on similar landform positions as the Pike soils. The somewhat poorly drained Taggart soils are on nearly level summits of outwash plains. The Hickory soils have less than 51 cm (20 inches) of loess are on backslopes of dissected till plains. The somewhat poorly drained Dubois soils are on flats of lake plains and the moderately well drained Otwell soils are on shoulders and backslopes of dissected lake plains."
