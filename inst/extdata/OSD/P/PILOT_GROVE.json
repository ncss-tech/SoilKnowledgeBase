  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to carbonates is 12 to 40 inches. Depth to glacial till ranges from 40 to 60 inches. The loamy mantle is 10 to 25 inches thick. The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches. The content of gravel, by volume, ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the upper loamy mantle, 10 to 35 percent in the sandy sediment, and 2 to 8 percent in the underlying till. Some pedons have thin subhorizons with more than 35 percent gravel. Cobbles range from 0 to 10 percent and stones range from 0 to 5 percent throughout.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or loam. It is neutral to moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or loam averaging less than 18 percent clay. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bw horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, sand or their gravelly analogs. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2BC, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, loamy sand or their gravelly analogs. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a 2Bk horizon. Properties are similar to the 2BC horizon but the reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Calcium carbonate coats are common on the bottom side of sand grains and pebbles.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is coarse sand, sand or their gravelly analogues. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a 3BC horizon that has coarse and extremely coarse prismatic primary structure. Other properties are similar to the 3C horizon.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. In MLRA 103, it is loam, sandy loam, clay loam or stratified silt loam, silty clay loam or very fine sandy loam with moist bulk density of 1.4 to 1.6 g/cc. It is typically friable when moist. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. In MLRA 107, it is loam or clay loam with moist bulk density of 1.6 to 1.8 g/cc. It is typically firm when moist. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Buckney, Burkhardt, Dickman, Estherville, Mishawaka and Round Lake series. Buckney, Burkhardt, Dickman, Estherville, and Mishawaka soils do not have loamy glacial till or stratified loamy material in the lower third of the series control section. Round Lake soils have a frequently saturated zone in the lower third of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pilot Grove soils have convex slopes ranging from 3 to 40 percent. They formed in 40 to 60 inches of loamy and sandy outwash sediments over loamy glacial till. They are on moraines, till plains or kames. Mean annual air temperature is about 45 to 55 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 25 to 32 inches. Frost free period ranges from 124 to 190 days. Elevation ranges from 700 to 1,600 feet above sea level."

The 3C horizon range in characteristics was broadened to include the till properties of MLRA 107 with this revision.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
