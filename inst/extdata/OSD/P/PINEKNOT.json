  "OVERVIEW": "The Pineknot series consist of very deep, well or moderately well drained soils formed in acidic loamy hillslope sediments over highly weathered clayey or gravelly clay residuum from dolomite. These nearly level to strongly sloping soils are on uplands of the Ozark Highlands. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. The mean annual soil temperature is about 14 degrees Celsius. Mean annual precipitation is about 1118 millimeters.",
