  "OVERVIEW": "The Porrone series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived mainly from limestone with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Porrone soils are on side slopes of hills.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
