Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent. These soils formed from eolian sand and weathered residuum sandstones. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 18 inches (355 to 457 millimeters). The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 52 degrees Fahrenheit (7.22 to 11.1 degrees Celsius). The frost-free period is 120 to 150 days."
