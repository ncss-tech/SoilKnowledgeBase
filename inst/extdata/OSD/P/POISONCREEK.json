  "OVERVIEW": "The Poisoncreek series consists of shallow, well or somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rocks.  These soils are on mountain and foothill ridges and sideslopes. Slopes range from 1 to 75 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 380 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
