Dotsolot soils are deeper than 36 cm. Garnel soils are intermittently moist in the upper part for 10 to 20 days cumulative due to convection storms between July and September. Lyra soils have fine carbonate coatings on the paralithic bedrock. Pinenut soils have mainly 5 to 75 mm gravel."

These soils formed in residuum derived from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 1 to 75 percent.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and warm and dry in the summer.  The average annual precipitation is 330 to 460 mm, and average annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 60 to 95 days."
