The 10- to 40-inch control section is silty clay loam or heavy silt loam, with 25 to 35 percent clay and 5 to 15 percent fine and coarser sand. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 46 degrees F. and average summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F. Hue of the entire soil is 5YR through 10R.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 6.\nThe BCk horizon has about 8 to 14 percent CaC03 equivalent."
