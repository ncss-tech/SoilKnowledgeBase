  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from the Frazier Well gravel formation.  Elevations are 6200 to 6800 feet.  Slopes range from 2 to 5 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  Annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches and the frost-free period is 120 to 150 days."

Pocomate soils have a lithic contact above 20 inches.  Retsover soils do not have a mollic epipedon and have bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Turkeytrack soils have an abrupt clay increase at the upper boundary of the argillic horizon and a mollic epipedon that is less than 20 inches thick."
