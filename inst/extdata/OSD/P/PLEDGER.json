  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Particle size and mineralogy data from the type location and TAMU data on 10 pedons from Matagorda, Wharton, Brazoria and Ft. Bend Counties, Texas, indicate a very-fine, montmorillonitic family.  Based on this data, classification changed from fine, mixed, thermic Vertic Hapludolls to very-fine, montmorillonitic, thermic Typic Pelluderts, 8/90.  The classification is changed from thermic Typic Pelluderts to hyperthermic Typic Hapluderts based on Amendment 16 to Soil Taxonomy (2/94).  The temperature regime change is based on NRCS temperature study. The series type location was moved from Fort Bend County to Brazoria County during the Soil Data Join and Recorrelation initiative in 2015. The Fort Bend site is on the fringe of the series province and was disturbed by nearby urban encroachment.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 133 cm (0 to 52 in) (A1, A, Bss1, and Bss2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon (more than 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent):133 to 220 cm (52 to 87 in) Bkss horizons\nCambic horizon: 44 to 220 cm (17 to 87 in) (Bss1, Bss2, Bkss1, Bkss2, Bkss3 horizons).\nVertic features: Slickensides from 44 to 220 cm (17 to  87 in).  Deep, wide cracks open less than 90 cumulative days in most years.\nADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL characterization data on type location on pedon number 98TX039003. Engineering test data by TDHPT (Sample No.  S76TX039-009, Brazoria County, TX).  More information on hydrology, vegetation and characterization can be found in the final report of the bottomland hardwoods soil moisture monitoring study conducted by Wes Miller of the NRCS.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
