The soils are on all hillslope positions of nearly level to very steep lava flows that are greater than 10,000 years old.  Slope gradients are dominantly 2 to 10 percent and range to 70 percent.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash and contain much olivine sand.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 380 to 760 millimeters (15 to 30 inches).  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 2030 to 2290 millimeters (80 to 90 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 22 to 24 degrees C. (72 to 76 degrees F.)  The mean summer and the mean winter soil temperatures differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)"
