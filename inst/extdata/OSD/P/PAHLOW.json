  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the cambic horizon and horizons of continuous carbonate accumulations ranges from 12 to 26 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 47 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 65 degrees F.  The particle-size control section has a loamy-skeletal Bw and, if present, Bk1 horizon over a noncontrasting sandy-skeletal 2Bk horizon.  When averaged, the particle-size control section is sandy-skeletal with 3 to 13 percent clay, 35 to 70 percent pebbles, and 5 to 25 percent cobbles. Subdivision of both the Bw and 2Bk horizons is common but not a requirement for the series.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 40 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5.  Texture of the matrix is sandy loam with 5 to 18 percent clay modified with 20 to 50 percent pebbles and 5 to 15 percent cobbles.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is the same as the Bw horizon.  Carbonates range from 5 to 15 percent.  Reaction is mildly alkaline (pH 7.8) or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5.  Texture of the matrix is loamy sand and less typically sand with 0 to 10 percent clay, 40 to 70 percent pebbles, and 5 to 25 percent cobbles.  Carbonates range from 10 to 25 percent with the majority occurring as moderately thick pendants on coarse fragments.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pahlow soils are on alluvial flats and terraces with mounded microrelief.  Mounds are a result of frost heaving in an ancient periglacial environment.  Pahlow soils occupy both the mounds and intermounded areas.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Elevations are 7,000 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 15 inches with peak periods occurring in April, May, and early June. The frost-free season is 85 to 110 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 1 inch (A).\nCambic horizon - 1 to 15 inches (Bw, Bw2).\nCalcic horizon - 15 to 40 inches (2Bk, 2Bk2).\nBorollic feature - Organic carbon and soil temperature regime meets the requirements for Borollic.\nThe calcic horizon is identified by crusts and pendants on coarse fragments.  Most of the carbonates have accumulated on pebbles 1 to 3 inches in diameter and in the upper part of the calcic horizon.  The carbonates do not appear to accumulate on smaller pebbles.  The amount of carbonate accumulation was not observed to decrease within 60 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
