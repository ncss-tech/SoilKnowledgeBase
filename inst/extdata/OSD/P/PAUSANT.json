  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 43 to 45 degrees F.  The soil is usually moist, but is dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches from 60 to 90 consecutive days.  The soil ranges from neutral to strongly acid.  Solum thickness exceeds 60 inches.  The control section averages less than 5 percent coarse fragments.  The argillic horizon is in the form of 1/16 to 4 inch thick lamellae that total more than 6 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry.  It is strongly acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry.  It has weak blocky structure or is massive.  It is strongly acid or slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has dry value of 6 or 7 dry.  It has weak blocky structure or is massive.  It is strongly acid or slightly acid.\nThe E and Bt and Bt horizons consists of lamellae of Bt 1/6 inch to 4 inches thick.  The Bt lamellae have hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 6 dry.  Texture is heavy sandy loam to sandy clay loam and averages 18 to 35 percent clay.  The E part has colors like the E horizon above.  Texture is mostly fine sand or loamy fine sand, but some strata are as heavy as clay.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral."

They formed in stratified sandy and silty glacial lacustrine materials.  Pausant soils are in a cold, subhumid climate with long, cold, wet winters, and short, hot, dry summers.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 41 to 43 degrees F, mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 25 inches, and frost-free period ranges from 90 to 120 days."
