The soil is usually moist, but is dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches from 60 to 90 consecutive days.  The soil ranges from neutral to strongly acid.  Solum thickness exceeds 60 inches.  The control section averages less than 5 percent coarse fragments.  The argillic horizon is in the form of 1/16 to 4 inch thick lamellae that total more than 6 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry.  It is strongly acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry.  It has weak blocky structure or is massive.  It is strongly acid or slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has dry value of 6 or 7 dry.  It has weak blocky structure or is massive.  It is strongly acid or slightly acid.\nThe E and Bt and Bt horizons consists of lamellae of Bt 1/6 inch to 4 inches thick.  The Bt lamellae have hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 6 dry.  Texture is heavy sandy loam to sandy clay loam and averages 18 to 35 percent clay.  The E part has colors like the E horizon above.  Texture is mostly fine sand or loamy fine sand, but some strata are as heavy as clay.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral."
