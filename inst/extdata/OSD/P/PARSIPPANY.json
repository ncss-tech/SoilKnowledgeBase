  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches with a lower boundary that ranges from clear to diffuse.  Depth to bedrock is more than 6 feet.  Coarse fragments are generally lacking but range to 5 percent in subhorizons within the solum and to 20 percent in the C horizon.  Unless limed, the reaction is very strongly or strongly acid near the surface and increases with depth to slightly acid to mildly alkaline in the C horizon.  Lamellae or varves are evident within the series control section.\nThe O horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2, and chroma of 1 or 2. In lieu texture is slightly, moderately, or highly decomposed plant material.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma 1 to 3.  Ap horizons have hues of 5YR to 10YR, values of 3 to 5 moist and 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The A horizons have weak or moderate medium or fine granular or subangular blocky structure and are friable or very friable. Some pedons have strong fine granular structure.\nThe B horizons have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6, with low chroma dominant in the upper part.  Also, hues of 10YR are only in the upper part.  Redoximorphic features are common or many, medium or coarse throughout the B horizon or the horizon is variegated with nearly equal proportions of two or three colors.  Texture in individual subhorizons ranges from silt loam to clay but the weighted average clay content in the textural control section is more than 35 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Redoximorphic features range from few to many and faint to distinct.  Texture ranges from clay to sandy loam above 40 inches and loamy sand to silty clay below."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Savona is the only series currently in the same family. Savona soils have carbonates within a depth of 36 inches.\nThe Aden, Crosby, Jeddo, Library, McGary, Pyrmont, and Randolph series are in related families.  Aden soils lack lamella in the control section. Crosby soils have carbonates within a depth of 36 inches.  Jeddo and Library soils lack stratification within the series control section.  McGary soils have hues of 10YR throughout the soil. Pyrmont soils have carbonates within depths of 18 inches. Randolph soils have bedrock within depths of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Parsippany soils are nearly level to gently sloping and generally within large basins.  Slope is 0 to 8 percent. These soils formed in silty and clayey sediments containing a high proportion of fines derived from weathered basalt, shale and granitic materials.  The climate is humid temperate.  Average annual precipitation is 40 to 48 inches and the growing season is about 140 to 170 days.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 to 50 degrees F."

Preakness soils are moderately coarse or coarse textured throughout the soil and Whippany soils are the moderately well and somewhat poorly drained members of the drainage sequence that includes Parsippany."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained.  Surface runoff is negligible to high. Permeability is moderate in the surface horizons, slow or very slow in the subsoil and moderately rapid to very slow in the substratum.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low to high in the surface horizons and low to moderately high in the subsoil and low to high in the substratum. The water level is at or near the surface throughout the winter and early spring and following periods of heavy rainfall.  Flooding is none to frequent and occurs in most areas of Parsippany soils but particularly adjacent to major streams."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Limited data is inconclusive but suggests that these soils have mixed clay mineralogy. Cation exchange activity class determined from a review of similar soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone between 0 and 9 inches (A, ABg, and Bg horizons)\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone between 9 and 29 inches (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons) with a clay average of more than 35 percent (fine)\n3. Aquic moisture regime - redoximorphic features with chroma of 2 or less immediately below the dark A horizon at 4 to 9 inches (Bg horizon) and dominant chroma of 1 or less in the argillic horizon of 9 to 29 inches (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons)\n4. Aeric Subgroup - the hue is 5 or less and the chroma is 2 or more within 75 cm of the surface in the zone of 18 to 29 inches (Btg2 horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
