  "STATES": "CO,NM,UT,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Persayo series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum derived from soft sedimentary bedrock. These soils are on hills, basin floor remnants, fan remnants, dipslopes, scarp slopes and escarpments. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 203 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 10.5 degrees C.",
