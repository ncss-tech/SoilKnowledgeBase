Adel soils lack a cambic horizon.  Argee soils are moderately deep to paralithic contact.  Bullbasin soils have mean annual soil temperatures less than 38 degrees F.  Duff soils lack O and Bw horizons.  Hackwood soils are moderately well drained and lack Bw horizons.  Leavittville, soils are calcareous within a depth of 40 inches.  Lamphier soils lack cambic horizons.  Ohbejoyful soils mean annual precipitation is greater than 30 inches.  Rhone soils have a larger component of sand in the control section and have sandy clay loam textures.  Lespate, Secondset, Strickland, and Winevada soils have bedrock within 40 inches.  Taterheap soils have a lithologic discontinuity."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pavohroo soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent. They formed in silty alluvium and colluvium derived from loess and a variety of sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 28 inches and the mean annual temperature is 36 to 42 degrees F.  Frost-free season is less than 65 days.  Elevation is 5,000 to 8,000 feet."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Camelback, Greys, Ireland, Moonlight, Ricrest, Sedgway, and Sheege series.  Camelback soils are loamy-skeletal, have argillic horizons, and are frigid.  Greys soils are fine-silty, and have albic and argillic horizons. Ireland soils are loamy-skeletal and are moderately deep to bedrock.  Moonlight soils are coarse-loamy.  Ricrest soils are frigid and have calcic horizons.  Sedgway soils are loamy-skeletal and have argillic horizons.  Sheege soils are loamy-skeletal and lithic.  Camelback, Ireland, and Ricrest are on south-facing mountain slopes.  Greys soils are on footslopes below the Pavohroo soil. Moonlight soils are on the same landscape positions as Pavohroo but on drier sites.  Sedgwick soils are on convex north and east-facing mountain slopes.  Sheege soils are on ridgetops."

Prior to this date no moisture regime was correlated to the series.  All soil surveys in which this series is used need review for udic or xeric soil moisture regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
