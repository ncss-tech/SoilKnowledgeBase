  "OVERVIEW": "The Pavohroo series consists of deep and very deep well drained soils that formed in silty alluvium and colluvium derived from loess and a variety of sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks.  They are on mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

Duff soils lack O and Bw horizons.  Hackwood soils are moderately well drained and lack Bw horizons.  Leavittville, soils are calcareous within a depth of 40 inches.  Lamphier soils lack cambic horizons.  Ohbejoyful soils mean annual precipitation is greater than 30 inches.  Rhone soils have a larger component of sand in the control section and have sandy clay loam textures.  Lespate, Secondset, Strickland, and Winevada soils have bedrock within 40 inches.  Taterheap soils have a lithologic discontinuity."

Ireland soils are loamy-skeletal and are moderately deep to bedrock.  Moonlight soils are coarse-loamy.  Ricrest soils are frigid and have calcic horizons.  Sedgway soils are loamy-skeletal and have argillic horizons.  Sheege soils are loamy-skeletal and lithic.  Camelback, Ireland, and Ricrest are on south-facing mountain slopes.  Greys soils are on footslopes below the Pavohroo soil. Moonlight soils are on the same landscape positions as Pavohroo but on drier sites.  Sedgwick soils are on convex north and east-facing mountain slopes.  Sheege soils are on ridgetops."

Prior to this date no moisture regime was correlated to the series.  All soil surveys in which this series is used need review for udic or xeric soil moisture regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
