  "OVERVIEW": "The Parohtog series consists of very deep, moderately well and somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  Parohtog soils are on alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
