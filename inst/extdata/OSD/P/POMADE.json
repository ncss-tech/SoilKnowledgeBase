    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 5 to 10 inches thick.  When mixed the upper 7 inches meet the requirement for a mollic epipedon. Depth to the indurated petrocalcic horizon ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Rock fragments in the control section ranges from 5 to 35 percent. The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches is 42 to 44 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F. These soils are usually moist, but are dry for 45 to 65 days during the summer solstice, and are moist in all parts for 60 to 75 consecutive days or more within the 3 month period following the winter solstice in more than 7 out of 10 years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is gravelly loam or very stony loam. This horizon is typically moderately calcareous, but is noncalcareous in the top 2 or 3 inches of some pedons. It is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loam, gravelly loam or cobbly loam and has 5 to 35 percent rock fragments. The Bk horizon is moderately through very strongly calcareous, but averages less than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. It is moderately or strongly alkaline and is 8 to 13 inches thick."

These soils occur on ridges, mountain slopes, and alluvial fans and formed in alluvium and colluvium from basic and intermediate igneous rocks. The climate is dry subhumid, the average annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 40 to 42 degrees F., and the frost free period is 80 to 90 days."
