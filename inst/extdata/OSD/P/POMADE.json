  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pomade series consists of shallow over hardpan, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basic and intermediate igneous rocks. Pomade soils occur on alluvial fans, ridges and mountain slopes. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 5 to 10 inches thick.  When mixed the upper 7 inches meet the requirement for a mollic epipedon. Depth to the indurated petrocalcic horizon ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Rock fragments in the control section ranges from 5 to 35 percent. The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches is 42 to 44 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F. These soils are usually moist, but are dry for 45 to 65 days during the summer solstice, and are moist in all parts for 60 to 75 consecutive days or more within the 3 month period following the winter solstice in more than 7 out of 10 years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is gravelly loam or very stony loam. This horizon is typically moderately calcareous, but is noncalcareous in the top 2 or 3 inches of some pedons. It is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loam, gravelly loam or cobbly loam and has 5 to 35 percent rock fragments. The Bk horizon is moderately through very strongly calcareous, but averages less than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. It is moderately or strongly alkaline and is 8 to 13 inches thick."
