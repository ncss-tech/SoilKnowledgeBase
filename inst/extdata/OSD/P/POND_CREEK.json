  "OVERVIEW": "The Pond Creek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous loamy material high in silt and very fine sand which was derived from a combination of loess, alluvium, residuum from red beds. These soils occur on paleoterraces on broad uplands in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and annual precipitation is 813 mm (32 in).",
