  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinaleno series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in fan alluvium from mixed rock.  Pinaleno soils are on fan terraces and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
