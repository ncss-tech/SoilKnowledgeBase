Condit soils have illitic mineralogy and are typically more acid than slightly acid in the solum. Latty and Wetzel soils have illitic mineralogy and average more than 40 percent clay in the particle-size control section. In addition, Latty soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments."

Pewamo soils are on similar landscape positions but have mollic epipedons. Digby, Haney, and Haskins soils are on nearby terraces and outwash plains. Shoals soils are on nearby flood plains."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Classification was adjusted to agree with ST Issue #17 on 22 Sept 94 by CLG. The Pandora series was inactivated in 1966. It was reactivated for use in Seneca County, Ohio, in January 1978, and the classification was changed from Mollic Haplaquepts to Typic Ochraqualfs. Pandora soils in modern surveys had been previously mapped with the Wetzel series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 18 cm (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 28 to 96 cm (Btg horizons).\nAquic conditions: redox features visible in all horizons below a depth of 18 cm.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory for one site in Seneca County (SA-33).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
