  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Series in closely related families are the Condit, Latty, and Wetzel soils. Condit soils have illitic mineralogy and are typically more acid than slightly acid in the solum. Latty and Wetzel soils have illitic mineralogy and average more than 40 percent clay in the particle-size control section. In addition, Latty soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pandora soils are in slight depressions on till plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in moderately fine textured till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 965 mm (32 to 38 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (47 to 53 degrees F)."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Blount, Glynwood, and Pewamo soils on till plains, and the Digby, Haney, Haskins, and Shoals soils. The somewhat poorly drained Blount soils are on slightly higher landscape positions. Glynwood soils are moderately well drained and on higher landscape positions. Pewamo soils are on similar landscape positions but have mollic epipedons. Digby, Haney, and Haskins soils are on nearby terraces and outwash plains. Shoals soils are on nearby flood plains."

An apparent seasonal high water table is at or within 30 cm (1 foot) of the surface during part of the same period. The potential for surface runoff in negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderately slow."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Classification was adjusted to agree with ST Issue #17 on 22 Sept 94 by CLG. The Pandora series was inactivated in 1966. It was reactivated for use in Seneca County, Ohio, in January 1978, and the classification was changed from Mollic Haplaquepts to Typic Ochraqualfs. Pandora soils in modern surveys had been previously mapped with the Wetzel series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 18 cm (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 28 to 96 cm (Btg horizons).\nAquic conditions: redox features visible in all horizons below a depth of 18 cm.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory for one site in Seneca County (SA-33).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
