  "OVERVIEW": "The Pernitas series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy alluvium derived from sandstone of Pleistocene and Pliocene ages.  These nearly level to moderately sloping soils are on summits, backslopes, and footslopes of ridges.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 711 mm (28 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 22.2 degrees C (72 degrees F).",
