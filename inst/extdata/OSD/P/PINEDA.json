  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 80 inches. Limestone bedrock below a depth of 60 inches may occur in some areas. Combined thickness of the A, E, E', and Bw horizons ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the A, E, E', B/E, and Bw horizons, strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the Btg horizon, and moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the Cg horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  Where the value is 3.5 or less, thickness is less than 10 inches.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 3; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown, or yellow range from none to common.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe E' horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Chromas of 3 and 4 are due to impurities in sand grains rather than coatings on sand grains.  In some pedons, there may be a weakly expressed Bh horizon that is 1 or 2 inches in thickness at the base of the E' horizon.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe B/E horizon has vertical sandy intrusions or tongues greater than 5 cm in length of the overlying albic materials (E).  The tongues range from about 5 cm or more in length and width and occupy more than 15 percent of the B/E horizon.  The E part of the B/E horizon has colors and textures similar to the E and E' horizons. The Btg part of the B/E horizon has hue of 10YR to 5BG, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 7.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow or brown range from none to common.  Clay content averages between 15 and 25 percent.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon, where present, has colors and textures similar to the B part of the B/E horizon.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has colors similar to the Btg and B/E horizons.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 8.  Texture is fine sand, sand, loamy sand, sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  In some pedons, the texture is sand mixed with up to 10 percent, by volume, shell fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pineda soils are in broad low flats, low hammock, sloughs, depressions, poorly defined drainageways and flood plains. They formed in beds of sandy and loamy marine sediments. The climate is humid semitropical. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The average annual air temperature ranges from 70 to 74 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches."

Anclote, Floridana, and Manatee soils are on similar to slightly lower positions, are very poorly drained, and have mollic epipedons.  Boca and Hallandale soils are on similar positions, but Boca soils are moderately deep to limestone bedrock and Hallandale soils are shallow to limestone bedrock.  EauGallie, Immokalee, Myakka, Oldsmar, and Wabasso soils are on similar to lower positions but have spodic horizons.  Felda, Riviera, and Winder soils are on similar positions but lack Bw horizons.  In addition, Winder soils have a sandy epipedon less than 20 inches thick.  Holopaw and Malabar soils are on similar to lower positions and have Btg horizons 40 to 80 inches deep.  The poorly drained Parkwood soils are on similar to slightly lower positions and have calcareous Bt horizons.  The very poorly drained Pompano soils are sandy throughout. Valkaria soils are sandy throughout."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Many areas of Pineda soils have been drained and are used for citrus, truck crops and tame pasture (pangolagrass and bahiagrass). In their undrained state, these soils are used for rangeland. Natural vegetation consists of south Florida slash pine, cypress, myrtle, cabbage palm, blue maidencane, chalky bluestem, bluepoint panicum, sawpalmetto sedges, pineland threeawn, and sand cordgrass."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nArenic properties - the zone from 0 to 36 inches (A, E, Bw1, Bw2 and E' horizons).\nAlbic horizons - the zones from 1 to 5 inches and from 24 to 36 inches (E and E' horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 36 to 54 inches (B/E horizon).\nGlossic horizon - the zone from 36 to 54 inches (B/E horizon).\nThe water table is within depths of 10 inches for 1 to 6 months. During the remainder of the year, it is typically at a depth of 10 to 40 inches below the surface.  It may, however, recede below 40 inches during extended dry periods. During periods of high rainfall, in some areas the soil is flooded from 7 days to 6 months. Depressions are ponded for periods of 3 to 6 months in most years.\nPineda soils are primarily in MLRA 155 and to a less extent in MLRAs 154, 156A, 156B, 138 and 152A.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data is available on the National Soil Survey website at: http://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/querypage.aspx\nLaboratory data is provided by the University of Florida, Department of Soil and Water Science, Gainesville, FL and the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
