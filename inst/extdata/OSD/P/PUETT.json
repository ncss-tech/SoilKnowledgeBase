Grina and Holborn soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Jacratz soils are very shallow to paralithic contacts and have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Stu soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have mean annual soil temperature of 12 or 13 degrees C. Tert soils are very shallow to paralithic contacts and have mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 15 degrees C.  Whilphang soils are intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October and have mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 15 degrees C."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Puett soils are on pediments, hills, mountains, and plateaus. They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff and tuffaceous sedimentary rocks. Slopes are 4 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 1,370 to 2,200 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."

Perwick soils coarse-loamy, moderately deep to paralithic contacts, and do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons. Susie Creek soils are fine, deep and very deep to paralithic contacts, and have mollic epipedons, argillic horizons, and horizons with weak silica cementation."
