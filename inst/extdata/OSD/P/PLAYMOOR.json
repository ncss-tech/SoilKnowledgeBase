  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10 to 40 inch particle size control section typically is silty clay loam, but silt loam is within the range averaging between 20 and 35 percent noncarbonate clay.  Some pedons have thin layers within the control section containing more than 35 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to more than 60 inches in thickness.  The electrical conductivity ranges from 4 to 16 mmho/cm in the upper 20 inches of the profile.  Exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from about 8 to 16 percent.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline throughout. Buried A horizons are common.  The A horizon and control section contain carbonate.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or neutral; value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry; and chroma of 1 or less.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam.  Fine accumulations of salt range from few to many in the A horizon.\nThe Bz horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or neutral; value of 2 to 4 and 3 to 7 dry; and chroma of 1 or less.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam.  Accumulations of salts, carbonate, and gypsum are few to many. Some pedons have a BC horizon with colors of the Bz horizon.  Some pedons do not have Bz horizons.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or neutral; value of 2 to 6 and 4 to 7 dry; and chroma of 0 or 1.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam.  Some pedons have a Bg horizon with colors of the Bk horizon.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Glacial till or thin strata of sand, silt or clay are below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons. Some pedons have a Cyg horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Playmoor soils are on nearly level flood plains and broad flats.  Slope gradients are less than 2 percent.  They formed in silty and clayey alluvial sediments and have high water tables.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 48 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation from 17 to 24 inches.  Growing season is about 120 to 130 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 3000."

The Lamoure and Ludden soils are in similar landscapes.  Dovray soils are deeper to carbonate, have a fine textured series control section, and are on similar landscapes. The Forman, Peever, and Poinsett soils do not have redox features with chroma of 2 or less within depths of 40 inches and are on adjacent uplands.  In addition, the Forman and Peever soils have argillic horizons. LaDelle soils are moderately well drained and do not have concentrations of salt in the upper part of the profile, and are on slightly higher positions on the landscape.  Ludden soils have a fine textured series control section."
