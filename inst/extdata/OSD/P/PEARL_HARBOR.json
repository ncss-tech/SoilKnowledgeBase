The soils formed in alluvium washed from material weathered from basic igneous rocks and deposited over and mixed with peat or muck.  Average annual rainfall is 457 to 1016 millimeters (18 to 40 inches).  Mean annual air temperature is 23 degrees C. (74 degrees F.), average January air temperature is 21 degrees C. (70 degrees F.), and average July air temperature is 26 degrees C. (78 degrees F.)"

Honouliuli soils are free of mottles and have 5YR hue throughout. Kaloko soils formed in calcareous material and are strongly calcareous in the upper 51 centimeters (20 inches).  Keaau soils are poorly drained, lack a buried muck or peat horizon, and are underlain by consolidated coral sand on reef limestone at depths of 51 to 91 centimeters (20 to 36 inches)."
