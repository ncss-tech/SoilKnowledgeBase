    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 65 to 71 degrees F.  In most years, the moisture control section is dry in all parts for more than half the time that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F; and it is dry for more than 50 days within the 4 months that follow the summer solstice.\nClay content in the particle size control section is 35 to 45 percent. A fluctuating water table is at a depth of 30 to 40 inches throughout the year.  Electrical conductivity of the A and Bn horizons is greater than 16 mmhos/cm, and is 2 to 16 mmhos/cm in the C horizons.  Salt flecks and filaments may be visible in the A and B horizons.\nThe An horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.  It is slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent.\nThe BAn horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay.  Reaction is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silty clay loam.  Some pedons have brittle, sand-sized aggregates that break down after prolonged rubbing.  The C horizons have few or common, fine or medium, faint to prominent mottles.  It is slightly effervescent to violently effervescent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have gypsum or carbonate filaments in the C horizons."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Paragonah soils are on flood plains and alluvial plains at elevations of 5,600 to 5,850 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from igneous and sedimentary rocks.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches.  The freeze free period is 100 to 120 days."

All of these soils do not have a water table and occur upslope from the Paragonah soils.  Antelope Springs soils have less than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Bullion soils have hue redder than 7.5YR.  Monroe soils have a thick mollic epipedon and do not have a natric horizon."
