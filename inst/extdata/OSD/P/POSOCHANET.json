The climate is arid and has hot dry summers and somewhat moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches. The mean January temperature is 46 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 80 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 62 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 230 to 300 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was mapped as Panoche series in the Coalinga Area, California Soil Survey, Series 1944, No.1 and in other areas in the south part of the San Joaquin Valley.  Posochanet soil is stratified, with irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth and is exclusively saline-sodic, which differentiates it from the Panoche series. Posochanet soils also occur in lower landform positions (fan skirts) than Panoche soils, which were correlated to exclude saline-sodic soils. The Range in Characteristics for this series includes soils mapped in the Fresno County, Western Part and Tulare County, Western Part Soil Surveys. It does not currently completely cover the Posochanet soil mapped in the Kern County, Southwestern Part Soil Survey.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL lab data is available for the Typical Pedon from soil sample number S87CA019-003 (4111-4116) This includes data for selenium content.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
