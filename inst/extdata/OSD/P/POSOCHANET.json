  "OVERVIEW": "The Posochanet series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on fan skirts. These soils formed in stratified alluvium derived dominantly from calcareous sedimentary rocks with influence from granitic rock sources in some areas. Slope is 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was mapped as Panoche series in the Coalinga Area, California Soil Survey, Series 1944, No.1 and in other areas in the south part of the San Joaquin Valley.  Posochanet soil is stratified, with irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth and is exclusively saline-sodic, which differentiates it from the Panoche series. Posochanet soils also occur in lower landform positions (fan skirts) than Panoche soils, which were correlated to exclude saline-sodic soils. The Range in Characteristics for this series includes soils mapped in the Fresno County, Western Part and Tulare County, Western Part Soil Surveys. It does not currently completely cover the Posochanet soil mapped in the Kern County, Southwestern Part Soil Survey."
