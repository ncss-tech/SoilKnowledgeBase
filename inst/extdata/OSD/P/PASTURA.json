  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Pastern (UT) and Tassi (AZ) series.  Similar soils are the Cardenas and Rolie soils.  Pastern soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Tassi soils have a lithic contact below the petrocalcic horizon.  The lithic contact occurs between 20 and 40 inches of the surface.  Cardenas and Rolie soils have a calcic horizon above the pertrocalcic horizon.  In addition, Cardenas soils contain less than 18 percent clay in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Pastura soils are on mesas, terraces, ridges and hills in areas associated with limestone.  Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent.  The present topography is related to past truncation of pediment slopes.  The soils formed in local medium textured material derived principally from sedimentary formations mixed with some eolian deposits.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches, but averages to 14 inches in some areas.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from 140 to 200 days and elevation ranges from 4,200 to 6,200 feet.  The Thornwaite P-E Index is 25."

Hagerman soils have argillic horizons and have sandstone bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Balon, Poley and Showlow soils are deep and have argillic horizons.  Harvey soils are deep and have a calcic horizon.  Springerville and Rune soils have fine-textured control sections and lack petrocalcic horizons.  Tapia soils have argillic horizons."
