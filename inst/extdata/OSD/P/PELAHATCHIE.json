  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness averages about 40 inches and ranges from 30 to 55 inches, and the thickness generally is variable within a short distance.  Depth to the calcareous clayey material ranges from 36 to 55 inches.  The A and Bt horizons range from very strongly acid to moderately acid, except the A horizon in areas that have been limed.  The 2Bt horizon ranges from strongly acid to mildly alkaline.  The C horizon is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR; value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam; a thin AB horizon, if present, has the same color and texture range as the A horizon.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 1OYR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4; and the value in the upper 10 inches commonly is 4.  Mottles, if present, are few to many in shades of gray or brown.  Grayish or brownish silt coatings commonly are on vertical faces of peds and along wormcasts.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 1OYR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6; or it has hue 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6; and it commonly is mottled with shades of red; or it is mottled in shades of brown, yellow, or red.  Grayish or brownish silt coatings commonly are on vertical faces of peds.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  The particle-size control section, (the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon) is 18 to 35 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon commonly is mottled in shades of brown, red, yellow, or gray; or it has a matrix in hue of 1OYR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6, with mottles in shades of brown, red, yellow, or gray.  Brown and black concretions are few to many.  It is silty clay or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have a 2BC horizon mottled in shades of yellow, brown, and gray.  It is silty clay or clay.  Black concretions are few to many.  Small calcareous nodules, if present, and soft calcium carbonate accumulations are few to common.\nThe 2C horizon is mottled in shades of yellow, brown, and gray.  It is silty clay or clay, with few to many soft calcium carbonate accumulations and small calcareous nodules.  Black concretions are few to many."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are the Askew and Center series in the same family and the closely related Boswell, Dubbs, Falkner, Freest, Gallion Kipling, Memphis, Rilla, Siwell, Susquehanna, and Tippah series.  Askew soils have a sandy or loamy 2C horizon below a depth of 42 inches.  Center soils are silty in the lower B and C horizons.  Boswell and Susquehanna soils have a solum more than 60 inches thick, and in most years deep wide cracks open.  Dubbs, Gallion, Memphis, and Rilla soils do not have mottles with chroma of 2 or less in the upper 10 inches of the Bt horizon and do not have clayey 2B or C horizons.  Falkner and Tippah soils, which have a solum more than 60 inches thick, have the lower part of the Bt horizon formed in acid clay.  Freest soils are fine-loamy in the particle-size control section.  Kipling soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy, and they are in a fine family.  Siwell soils do not have gray mottles in the upper 10 inches of the Bt horizon, and the water table is perched at a depth of 2.5 to 3.0 feet in wet seasons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pelahatchie soils formed in a mantle of silty material, about 15 to 30 inches thick, and the underlying calcareous clayey material of the Yazoo Formation.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on broad uplands in the Blackland Prairie.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The climate is warm and humid.  The mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 51 inches near the type location."

Falkner and Kipling soils are on similar landscape positions as the Pelahatchie soils.  Providence soils are slightly higher in the landscape and have fragipan.  Savannah soils, which are slightly higher or slightly lower in the landscape, have a fragipan and a fine-loamy particle-size class."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nEpipedon - the epipedon almost meets the color criterion for a mollic epipedon.\nArgillic horizon - the zone from approximately 6 to 43 inches (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt1, 2Bt2).\nAquic feature - mottles with the chroma of 2 in the Bt2 horizon.\nThe Pelahatchie series was originally proposed in 1960 as the Leesburg series and was later dropped in 1969.  The Pelahatchie series is closely related to the Siwell series, but it differs, in part, in that the soils are in broad, nearly level to gently sloping uplands that were originally in prairie grasses and scattered hardwoods in the Blackland Prairie; whereas, the Siwell soils are in small size units on short slopes in undulating to rolling landscapes that were originally forested with mixed hardwoods in the Southern Mississippi Valley Silty Uplands.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data on the typifying pedon were obtained from the Soil Genesis and Morphology Laboratory of the Mississippi Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station, MSU Sample - 8105-1-6 S81MS-121-1(1-6).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
