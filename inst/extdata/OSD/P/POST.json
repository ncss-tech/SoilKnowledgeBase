These soils formed in strongly alkaline clayey glacial till or glaciolacustrine deposits.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist falls; moist springs; and hot, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 105 to 135 days."
