  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Haigler and Kitcarson series. Haigler and Kitcarson soils receive peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months, and also receive about 14 to 17 inches of annual precipitation. Haigler soils also have SAR values greater than 15 within the particle-size control section.  (The Bosquecito series is also in this family, and the series concept is very close to Peralta.  The two series should be investigated to determine if they should be combined? The Bosquecito soils appears to have longer periods of saturation, are described with Cg horizons, and have intermediate amounts of mica in the coarse silt to fine sand fractions.)"
