Soil reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 through 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and dry.  Pumice fragments average from 5 to 15 percent.\nThe 2Bw1 horizon has 60 to 75 percent pumice fragments and 5 to 15 percent pebbles.  Iron stains have hue of 10YR of 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 moist.\nThe 3Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  The horizon has intermittent lenses and pockets of silt loam to coarse sand size ash, and scoria fragments.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction and has 12 to 15 percent 15-bar moisture (dry).  Pumice fragments average from 10 to 25 percent and hard rock fragments average 5 to 10 percent.\nThe 4C horizon averages 45 to 75 percent rock fragments including 35 to 50 percent pebbles, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, and 2 to 10 percent stones.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pinchot soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments at elevations of 1,000 to 1,600 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  Pinchot soils formed in layers of aerially deposited pumice and volcanic ash overlying lahar and alluvial sand and gravels.  Beginning at the surface of the mineral soil, the stratigraphy of pyroclastic material from Mt. St. Helens in a typical Pinchot soil profile is (1) fresh ash and pumice including the 176-year old \"Layer T\", (2) pumice of the 400-year-old \"LayerW\", (3) ash, pumice and scoria of the 2,500-year-old \"B set\", (4) lahar material or gravelly alluvium.  The climate is characterized by warm, moist summers and cool, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 115 to 130 inches.  Average January temperature is 30 degrees F, average July temperature is 63 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 6 inches, and a cambic horizon from 6 to 34 inches formed in volcanic ash and a lithologic change to a sandy-skeletal lahar at 34 inches.  The particle-size control section is from the soil surface to 40 inches; with 4 to 6 inches qualifying as ashy-pumiceous; 6 to 34 inches qualifying as medial; and 34 to 40 inches qualifying as sandy-skeletal.  The particle-size class is based on the contrasting medial layer over sandy-skeletal layer.\nClassification changed 7/98 based on 1998 Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
