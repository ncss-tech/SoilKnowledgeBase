The Udollic Epiaqualfs subgroups and was considered poorly, very poorly and somewhat poorly drained.  The Becida series was developed in 1996 to represent the poorly drained concept of these soils.\nThe upper part of the profile appears to have been modified and stone lines have been identified in the field.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nPedon 87MN111043 is the type location.\nLaboratory data--KSSL pedon 81MN153004 was sampled as a poorly drained Paddock and has been correlated to Becida series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
