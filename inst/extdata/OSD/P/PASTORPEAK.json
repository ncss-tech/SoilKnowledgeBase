  "OVERVIEW": "The Pastorpeak series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from quartz diorite and sandstone.  Pastorpeak soils are on backslopes of mountains.  Slopes are 50 to 95 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
