Adellern soils are deeper than 40 inches to accumulations of calcium carbonate.  Mapache soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from latite and dacite of the Tertiary age Tschicoma Formation and are slightly acid or neutral throughout. Pastorius soils are noncalcareous throughout.  Zillion soils have clay contents in the particle-size control section ranging from 27 to 35 percent and the base of the argillic horizon is less than 30 inches.  Braziel and Fessler soils are moist in May and June."
