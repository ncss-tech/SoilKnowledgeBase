Luff soils have a coarse-loamy surface texture and an abrupt textural change. Luff and Freeboard soils have an LEP of greater than 6. Starboard and Starbright soils are deep, mesic and isomesic under oaks and other large shrubs. Halyard soils are moderately deep, have a mollic horizon and has an LEP less then 6. Tongva soils are moderately deep and fine-loamy.   All these soils are found on hills and mountains."
