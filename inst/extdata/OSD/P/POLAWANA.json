  "REVDATE": "07/1999",
  "STATES": "VA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Polawana series consists of deep, very poorly drained, rapidly permeable, sandy soils that formed in marine sediments. The water table is near or above the surface for as much as 6 months during most years.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is very strongly acid to neutral throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y, or it is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, silt loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, sand, or fine sand, or their mucky analogues.  Horizons with texture of loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or silt loam are less than 24 inches thick.\nThe C horizon commonly has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y or it is neutral, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Some pedons have a value of 2 or 3 with chroma of 2 or 4.  The C horizon is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, sand, or fine sand; and in the upper part of the horizon mucky analogues of these textures is permitted."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Polawana soils are on nearly level areas adjacent to drainageways, streams, and on depressional areas in the Lower Coastal Plain. Slopes are less than 2 percent.  These soils formed in sandy marine sediments.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 68 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 54 inches, and the freeze-free season ranges from 190 to 290 days."

Baratari, Ridgeland, and Seewee soils have a Bh horizon.  Seabrook soils do not have a cumulic epipedon.  Deloss and Stono soils have textures finer than loamy fine sand.  Wando soils do not have wetness mottles of chroma 2 or less to a depth of 40 inches.  Yemassee soils have an argillic horizon."
