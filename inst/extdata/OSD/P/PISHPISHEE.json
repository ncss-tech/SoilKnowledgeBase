  "OVERVIEW": "The Pishpishee series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from metasediments.  Pishpishee soils are on lower mountain sideslopes and dormant landslides.  Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
