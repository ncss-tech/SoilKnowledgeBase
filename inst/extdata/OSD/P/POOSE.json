    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 36 to 40 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F.  These soils are noncalcareous throughout.  The solum ranges from 20 to 30 inches thick.  Base saturation is less than 60 percent in subhorizons above 30 inches.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent throughout the particle-size control section with amounts increasing with depth.  They consist of small shale chips or sandstone channers.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 50 percent clay, 30 to 60 percent silt, and 0 to 30 percent sand.  Highly weathered shale material occurs below 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is slightly acid or moderately acid in reaction.\nThe B and C horizons have hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  They are moderately acid to very strongly acid."
