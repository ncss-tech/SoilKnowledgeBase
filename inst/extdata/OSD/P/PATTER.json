  "OVERVIEW": "The Patter series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived primarily from welded tuff, and other mixed rocks.  Patter soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
