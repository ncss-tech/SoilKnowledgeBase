In addition, Enko soils have horizons with a continuous brittle matrix and hard, firm consistence.  Kerrfield soils are moderately deep.  Orovada soils do not have carbonates in the Bw horizon.  Prineville soils are deep over water-laid sediments or tuffaceous sandstone.  Ultramont soils have 40 percent or more medium through very coarse sand and 10 to 15 percent andesite gravel that are mostly 2 to 5 mm diameter."
