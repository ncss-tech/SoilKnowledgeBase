  "OVERVIEW": "The Peavy series consists of moderately well drained and well drained soils on ground moraines that are deep to a dense glacial till paralithic contact.  They formed in modified loamy eolian material and in underlying loamy, dense glacial till.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the soil and very slow in the lower part.  Slopes range from 1 to 18 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 26 to 50 inches and the depth to the dense till paralithic contact is more than 60 inches.  The content of channers ranges from 2 to 10 percent in the Ap, Bs and E horizons, and from 2 to 20 percent in the 2Btd horizon and 15 to 50 percent in the dense till.  Cobble content ranges from 1 to 5 percent in the solum and 5 to 10 percent in the dense till.  Stone content ranges from 0 to 2 percent throughout the soil.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid throughout.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have A horizons with similar color and textures to the Ap horizon.  Some pedons have an E horizon immediately below the A horizon with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is similar to the Ap horizon.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR; value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The E horizon immediately below the Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  The Bs and E horizons are loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe 2Btd and 2Cd horizons have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4.  They are channery loam, channery sandy loam, very channery loam, or very channery sandy loam."

Abbaye soils have bedrock within 40 inches of the surface.  The Alcona, Goodman, Padus, Sarona, Trenary and Ubly soils do not have Btd or Cd horizons.  Cheboygan soils contain loamy sand in the upper part of the series control section.  Emmet soils do not have spodic horizons. Newood soils do not have textures of loam, channery loam or very channery loam in the argillic horizon, do not contain slate channers in the profile, do not have Btd horizons, and formed in sandstone."
