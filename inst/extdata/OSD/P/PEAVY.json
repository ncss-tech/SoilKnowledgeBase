  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 26 to 50 inches and the depth to the dense till paralithic contact is more than 60 inches.  The content of channers ranges from 2 to 10 percent in the Ap, Bs and E horizons, and from 2 to 20 percent in the 2Btd horizon and 15 to 50 percent in the dense till.  Cobble content ranges from 1 to 5 percent in the solum and 5 to 10 percent in the dense till.  Stone content ranges from 0 to 2 percent throughout the soil.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid throughout.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have A horizons with similar color and textures to the Ap horizon.  Some pedons have an E horizon immediately below the A horizon with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is similar to the Ap horizon.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR; value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The E horizon immediately below the Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  The Bs and E horizons are loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe 2Btd and 2Cd horizons have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4.  They are channery loam, channery sandy loam, very channery loam, or very channery sandy loam."

Abbaye soils have bedrock within 40 inches of the surface.  The Alcona, Goodman, Padus, Sarona, Trenary and Ubly soils do not have Btd or Cd horizons.  Cheboygan soils contain loamy sand in the upper part of the series control section.  Emmet soils do not have spodic horizons. Newood soils do not have textures of loam, channery loam or very channery loam in the argillic horizon, do not contain slate channers in the profile, do not have Btd horizons, and formed in sandstone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Peavy soils are on ground moraines of Wisconsin age.   Iron rich slate usually underlies this soil and occasionally outcrops.  Slope gradients range from 1 to 18 percent.  They formed in modified loamy eolian material and in the the underlying noncalcareous, loamy dense till.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 32 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 41 to 43 degrees F."

Padus soils have sand and channery sand substratums and are on adjacent outwash plains.  Sarona and Wabeno soils are adjacent to Peavy soil on similar landscape positions but do not have dense till."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Many areas of this soil were cleared for agricultural and mining purposes.  A few areas remain in mixed grasses and shrubs, but most have now reverted to a hardwood forest.  Sugar maple is the principal species.  Ground vegetation includes sugar maple, sedges, ladyfern, sweet cicely, downy yellow violet, maiden hair fern, bloodroot, trillium, white baneberry, wild leek and rattlesnake grapefern."
