  "OVERVIEW": "The Papai series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils consisting of organic material over fragmental `a`a lava substrata at a shallow depth.  Papai soils formed in organic material over `a`a lava and are on low elevation, windward slopes of Mauna Loa and Kilauea shield volcanoes.  Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 3900 millimeters (154 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).",

These soils form in a thin mantle of organic material overlying `a`a lava.  These soils are in constructional landscapes consisting of undulating `a`a lava flows that are 400 to 1500 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 10 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is 3000 to 5000 millimeters (118 to 197 inches) with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 762 to 1016 millimeters (30 to 40 inches).  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 21 to 23 degrees C (70 to 73 degrees F).
