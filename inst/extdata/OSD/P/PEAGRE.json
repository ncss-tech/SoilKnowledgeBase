  "OVERVIEW": "The Peagre series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum derived from interbedded sandstone and shale.  These soils are on mesa tops.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
