These soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from mixed rocks with a small component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,310 to 1,985 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
