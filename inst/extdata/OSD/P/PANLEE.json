  "OVERVIEW": "The Panlee series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed rocks with components of loess and volcanic ash.  The Panlee soils are on hill and mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
