  "OVERVIEW": "The Polychrome series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  Polychrome soils are on hills and scarps.  Slopes range from 25 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
