  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Color, arrangement, and thickness of horizons vary considerably because of the nature of the parent material.  Organic carbon content decreases irregularly with depth.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sand.  Uncultivated areas have an A horizon with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Reaction of the A or Ap horizon ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizons have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sand, fine sand or loamy fine sand.  Thin horizons of loamy sand to silt are below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons.  The C horizon contains high chroma mottles at variable depths below 20 inches.  Reaction of the C horizons ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soil formed in sandy alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 34 inches, and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 47 degrees F."

These soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of 2.5 to 3.5 feet below the surface at some time during the period from November to May in most years. It is subject to occasional to frequent flooding for brief periods of time from March to May. Surface runoff is negligible.  Permeability is rapid."
