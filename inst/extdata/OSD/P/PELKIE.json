  "STATES": "MI,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pelkie series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy alluvium.  These soils have rapid permeability. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Color, arrangement, and thickness of horizons vary considerably because of the nature of the parent material.  Organic carbon content decreases irregularly with depth.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sand.  Uncultivated areas have an A horizon with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Reaction of the A or Ap horizon ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizons have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sand, fine sand or loamy fine sand.  Thin horizons of loamy sand to silt are below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons.  The C horizon contains high chroma mottles at variable depths below 20 inches.  Reaction of the C horizons ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid."

These soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of 2.5 to 3.5 feet below the surface at some time during the period from November to May in most years. It is subject to occasional to frequent flooding for brief periods of time from March to May. Surface runoff is negligible.  Permeability is rapid."
