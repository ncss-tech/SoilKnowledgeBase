    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Prosperity soils were previously included in mapping with Helena soils. Helena soils have a depth to paralithic contact of greater than 60 inches. The August 1991 revision of Helena changed depth to bedrock from \"more than 48 inches to more than 60 inches\" to be consistent with one depth to bedrock class as shown on the Soil Interpretation Records. The slope ramge was changed to allow up to 25 percent slopes (8/2007).\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 6 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 6 to 35 inches (Bt and BCt horizons)\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nCharacterization samples have been submitted to the National Soil Survey Center, Lincoln, Nebraska.
