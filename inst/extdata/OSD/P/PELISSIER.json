  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (Unless otherwise stated the depths in the following paragraph are measured from the mineral soil surface.) Solum thickness ranges from 18 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the loamy mantle ranges from 0 to 9 inches.  The particle size control section averages from 35 to 65 percent rock fragments derived from acidic igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks. Gravel content ranges from 1 to 35 percent in the E horizon, from 15 to 35 percent in the Bs1 horizon and from 15 to 60 percent in the rest of the profile. Cobbles range from 0 to 55 percent in the E and Bs1 horizons and from 0 to 70 percent throughout the remainder of the pedon. Stones within the pedon range from 0 to 2 percent, and surface stones cover from less than .01 percent to 0.1 percent of the surface.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 3.  The A and E horizons are sandy loam,gravelly sandy loam, gravelly coarse sandy loam, gravelly loamy sand, gravelly sand, gravelly coarse sandy loam and very cobbly cobbly sandy loam. The A and E horizons are extremely to strongly acid.\nThe Bs1 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4. It is the gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly, or very cobbly analogs of sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand or coarse sand.  The Bs2 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 and chroma of 4 to 6. It is the gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly, or very cobbly analogs of loamy sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, sand or coarse sand. The Bs horizons are very strongly acid to strongly acid.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with colors like the Bs2 horizon. It is the gravelly, very gravelly, extremely gravelly, cobbly, very cobbly, or extremely cobbly analogs of loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or coarse sand. The BC horizon is strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The C horizon is very gravelly,  extremely gravelly, very cobbly, or extremely cobbly analogs of coarse sand or sand.  The C horizon is strongly acid."
