  "OVERVIEW": "The Pootatuck series consists of very deep, moderately well drained loamy soils formed in alluvial sediments. They are nearly level soils on floodplains subject to frequent to occasional flooding. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the loamy upper layers and high or very high in the sandy substratum. Mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees Celsius, and mean annual precipitation is about 1190 millimeters.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to the coarse-textured substratum range from 50 to 100 centimeters. Gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent by volume in the solum and from 0 to 40 percent in the substratum. Some pedons have up to 15 percent cobbles in the substratum. Unless limed, reaction ranges very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. It has weak or moderate granular structure and is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y and value and chroma of 3 to 6. Iron depletions occur above a depth of 60 centimeters. The Bw horizon is dominantly fine sandy loam or sandy loam, but includes thin strata of loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam. It has granular or subangular blocky structure, or the horizon is massive. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have thin Ab horizon strata.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. It is typically has redoximorphic features in some subhorizon. Texture of individual layers ranges from loamy fine sand to coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. Included in some pedons are thin loamy and/or extremely gravelly strata. Also, some pedons have a loamy C horizon layer just below the Bw horizon. The C horizon is single grain and loose in the sandy part. The loamy part is typically massive and friable or very friable. The thickness and number of subhorizons is variable and corresponds to the thickness and variability of the alluvial deposits."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Basher, Iotla, Issue, and Philo series are currently in the same family. Iotla and Issue series are from outside LRRs L, R and S. Basher soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder in the B horizon. Philo soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Iotla soils have redoximorphic features in the upper part of the B horizon. Issue soils are somewhat poorly drained. Iotla and Issue soils also have mean summer temperatures more than 3 degrees Celsius warmer than Pootatuck soils."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pootatuck soils are nearly level soils on floodplains and along rivers and streams. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in recent alluvium derived mostly from granite, gneiss, and schist. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees Celsius, mean annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 1270 millimeters, but the range includes as low as 660 millimeters in some places east of Adirondack Mountains in the Champlain Valley of New York. The growing season ranges from 115 to 190 days."

The well drained Occum and the poorly drained Rippowam soils are associated in a drainage sequence. Agawam, Enfield, Haven, Hinckley, Merrimac, and Windsor soils are better drained and are on nearby outwash terraces. Hadley, Lim, Limerick, and Saco soils are silty floodplain associates. Suncook soils are sandy, excessively drained soils on floodplains."
