  "OVERVIEW": "The Peltier series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in mixed alluvium and hydrophytic plant remains.  Peltier soils are in islands in deltas and in backswamps of marshes.  Slope is 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

The organic matter content decreases irregularly with depth and ranges from 10 to 25 percent.  Strata of silty clay or clay occur within the 10 to 40 inch zone.  The mollic epipedon is 24 to 32 inches thick and has distinct mottles in the lower part.  Some pedons have an ash layer about 1 to 2 inches thick in the upper 24 inches due to burning.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 62 degrees F.\nThe Ap and A horizons are 10YR 5/1, 4/1, 3/1, 2/2; N 3/0, 4/0.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/1, 2/1; N 3/0, 2/0.

Egbert soils have 2 to 10 percent organic matter in the 10 to 40 inch zone.  Gazwell soils have a buried Histosol within 40 inches.  Girard soils have a lithic contact of limestone between 20 to 40 inches.  Godwin soils have moderately slow permeability, and medium or high phosphorus content, which washed from soils formed mainly in material weathered from phosphatic limestone.  Omni and Pitco soils have mollic epipedons less than 24 inches thick and montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Scribner soils are fine-loamy."

The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches.  Mean January temperature is 47 degrees F; mean July temperature is 72 degrees F; mean annual temperature is about 60 to 62 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 260 to 280 days."

The drainage of these soils has been altered by the use of levees and pumps.  Water tables occur between 36 and 60 inches throughout the year.  Flooding is rare due to protection by levees."

Egbert soils will now have a weighted average organic matter content of 2 to 10 percent in the control section.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 24 inches (Ap,A,BA).\nCumulic subgroup - mollic epipedon is 24 to 32 inches thick.\nSeries reclassified 5/95.  Competing series not updated at that time.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in February of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET"
