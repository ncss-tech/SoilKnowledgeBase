    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The weighted average clay content in the 10 to 40 inch control section is 35 to 45 percent clay with 15 to 45 percent fine sand or coarser.  The organic matter content decreases irregularly with depth and ranges from 10 to 25 percent.  Strata of silty clay or clay occur within the 10 to 40 inch zone.  The mollic epipedon is 24 to 32 inches thick and has distinct mottles in the lower part.  Some pedons have an ash layer about 1 to 2 inches thick in the upper 24 inches due to burning.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 62 degrees F.\nThe Ap and A horizons are 10YR 5/1, 4/1, 3/1, 2/2; N 3/0, 4/0.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/1, 2/1; N 3/0, 2/0.  Reaction is moderately acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon is 10YR 3/1, 4/1, 5/2, 5/3; 2.5Y 5/2, 4/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 2/1, 3/1, 4/1, 4/2; 2.5Y 4/2, 3/2.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay and clay or its mucky equivalents.  Thin strata of muck may be present.  Reaction is moderately acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon is 5Y 5/2; 5BG 5/1; 10YR 3/3.  Moist colors are 5Y 4/2; 5BG 4/1; 10YR 3/2.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay, clay or their mucky equivalents.  Reaction is moderately acid to mildly alkaline. Where muck or mucky peat is present below 40 inches the colors are 10YR 3/3, 3/1, 2/2 or 2/1.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/1 or 2/1.  Organic matter content ranges from 35 to 65 percent.  Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Egbert, Gazwell (T), Girard and Godwin soils in the same family and the Omni, Pitco, and Scribner soils in other families.  Egbert soils have 2 to 10 percent organic matter in the 10 to 40 inch zone.  Gazwell soils have a buried Histosol within 40 inches.  Girard soils have a lithic contact of limestone between 20 to 40 inches.  Godwin soils have moderately slow permeability, and medium or high phosphorus content, which washed from soils formed mainly in material weathered from phosphatic limestone.  Omni and Pitco soils have mollic epipedons less than 24 inches thick and montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Scribner soils are fine-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Peltier soils are in islands on deltas, on flood plains and in backswamps of marshes in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from mixed sources.  Elevations are 15 feet below sea level to 20 feet above sea level.  The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches.  Mean January temperature is 47 degrees F; mean July temperature is 72 degrees F; mean annual temperature is about 60 to 62 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 260 to 280 days."

The drainage of these soils has been altered by the use of levees and pumps.  Water tables occur between 36 and 60 inches throughout the year.  Flooding is rare due to protection by levees."

    "content": "REMARKS:  The Peltier series consists of a split of the wide organic matter range of the Egbert series.  Egbert soils will now have a weighted average organic matter content of 2 to 10 percent in the control section.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 24 inches (Ap,A,BA).\nCumulic subgroup - mollic epipedon is 24 to 32 inches thick.\nSeries reclassified 5/95.  Competing series not updated at that time.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in February of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
