  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pajara series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly\npermeable soils that formed in cobbly mixed alluvium on dissected piedmont slopes. These soils are on the tops and side slopes of broad ridges at the base of mountains. Slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
