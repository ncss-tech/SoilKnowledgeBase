Further study of the pedon at the type location is needed to insure proper classification.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 14 inches. (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon: 4 to 14 inches. (Bt horizon)\nCalcic horizon: 14 to 60 inches. (Bk horizons)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
