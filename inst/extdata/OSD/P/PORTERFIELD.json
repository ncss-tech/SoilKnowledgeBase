  "OVERVIEW": "The Porterfield series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in material weathered from diatomaceous earth and lacustrine tuff.  Porterfield soils are on hills and side slopes of plateaus and have slopes of 2 to 60 percent.  The annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The soil temperature is warmer than 41 degrees F between March 15 to December 1 and is warmer than 47 degrees F between April 15 and November 15.  The soil is dry from June 15 to November 10 and is never moist 90 consecutive days when the soil temperature is greater than 47 degrees F.   Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 30 percent.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 7/2 or 6/2 and moist color of 10YR 4/2, 3/2 or 3/3.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 50 percent.  Textures are loam, stony loam or very stony loam.  Thickness ranges from 3 to 9 inches.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 7/3, 6/3 or 7/2 and moist color of 10YR 4/3, 4/2 or 3/3.  In the upper C horizon rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent.  In the lower C horizon rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent.
