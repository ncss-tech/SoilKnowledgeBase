  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually dry in all parts between a depth of 8 and 24 inches for more than half the time when the soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 55 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness.  Depth to the lithologic discontinuity ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The upper part of the particle-size control section is 5 to 10 percent clay, less than 50 percent sand coarser than very fine and 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments.  The lower part of the particle-size control section is 35 to 70 percent coarse fragments, 2 to 10 percent clay and 75 to 95 percent sand.\nThe A and BA horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam, and is gravelly or cobbly.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon is multicolored.  It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or coarse sand and is very gravelly, very cobbly, or extremely gravelly.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."

The soils formed in loess and glacial outwash.  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  These soils occur in a climate of hot, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average January temperature is 24 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 75 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free season is 140 to 190 days."

Cashmere, Cashmont, Farrell, Malott, Okanogan, and Tonasket soils are coarse-loamy.  Ellisforde soils are coarse-silty.  Ewall and Quincy soils are sandy throughout and lack a mollic epipedon.  Peshastin and Strat soils are loamy-skeletal.  Skaha soils are sandy-skeletal and lack a mollic epipedon."
