It is silty clay loam, silt loam or silty clay or their mucky analogues. It is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.

The Palmers soils have seasonal high saturation at the surface during spring and fall in normal years.  Palmer soils also pond following periods of heavy rainfall."
