    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to carbonates ranges from 50 to 127 cm.  Rock fragment content ranges from 1 to 5 percent gravel, by volume, throughout the profile. Slickenslides are common throughout the profile.\nSome pedons have an O horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR  to 10YR, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 or 1. It is silty clay loam, silt loam or silty clay or their mucky analogues. It is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. It is clay or silty clay.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. It is clay or silty clay. It is slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. It  is clay or silty clay.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Palmer soils are in concave to linear drainageways and depressions on till plains and glacial lake plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. They formed in clayey Superior Lobe till of the late Wisconsinan glaciation. Mean  annual temperature ranges from about 3 to 6 degrees C. and  mean annual precipitation ranges from 625 to 875 mm.  Annual frost free days range from 100 to 140 days.  The elevation above sea level ranges from 150 to 400 meters."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Miskoaki, Amnicon, and Cuttre soils. The well drained Miskoaki, moderately well drained Amnicon and the somewhat poorly and poorly drained Cuttre soils form a hydrosequence with the Palmer soils.  They all are found on higher lying or more sloping positions on the landscape."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is 1.41 to 14.11 micrometers per second (0.2 to 2.0 inches per hour) in the upper part and 0 to 1.41 micrometers per second (0 to 0.2 inches per hour) in the lower part.  The Palmers soils have seasonal high saturation at the surface during spring and fall in normal years.  Palmer soils also pond following periods of heavy rainfall."
