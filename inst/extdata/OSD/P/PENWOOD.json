  "REVDATE": "11/2004",
  "STATES": "CT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Penwood series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in sandy outwash.  They are nearly level to strongly sloping soils on glaciofluvial landforms.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. Mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 46 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 36 inches.  Rock fragments, dominantly fine gravel, range from 0 to 10 percent in the solum and from 0 to 30 percent in the substratum.  Unless limed, the soil is very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Undisturbed pedons have a thin A horizon with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.  The Ap or A horizon is commonly loamy sand or loamy fine sand but the range includes fine sandy loam.  It has weak granular structure and is friable to loose.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is loamy sand or loamy fine sand in the upper part and loamy fine sand, loamy sand, sand or fine sand in the lower part.  Some pedons have thin subhorizons of loamy coarse sand or coarse sand.  The Bw horizon has weak granular structure or it is single grain.  Consistence is very friable or loose.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is dominantly sand or fine sand, but ranges to subhorizons of coarse sand."

Aldo and Scotah soils are moderately\nwell drained and have saturation within the series control section for as much\nas 1 month per year in 6 or more out of 10 years. Bigapple, Biltmore, Breeze,\nOsolo, and Spessard soils are well drained. Bigapple and Breeze soils contain\nhumanly transported or manufactured fragments. Boplain soils have a paralithic\ncontact within the control section. Caesar, Oakville, Plainfield, Tyner and\nWindsor soils have hue yellower than 7.5YR in the B horizon. Poquonock soils have a densic contact."

Slope commonly ranges from 0 to 8 percent but the range includes 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in outwash deposits of loamy sands and sands derived mainly from red Triassic rocks with some basalt.  Mean annual temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 42 to 50 inches and the growing season is 130 to 190 days."

Bash soils are somewhat poorly drained soils on flood plains.  Branford soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal.  Hartford soils have a cambic horizon and Manchester soils are sandy-skeletal.  Cheshire, Wethersfield and Yalesville soils are on nearby till hills.  Deerfield and Ellington soils are moderately well drained terrace associates.  Walpole soils are poorly drained."
