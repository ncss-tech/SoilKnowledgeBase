These soils formed in recent alluvium from granitic rocks with minor influence of other igneous materials. The average annual precipitation is 254 to 330 mm. The average annual temperature is 10 to 11 degrees C. The frost-free period is 145 to 155 days."

Phyllis soils are subject to frequent ponding and flooding where not protected for brief periods from December to June.  These soils are commonly saturated to the surface during the growing season due to flood irrigation."
