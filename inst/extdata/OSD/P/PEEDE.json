  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the organic mat ranges from 1 to 5 inches (3 to 12 cm). The texture of the control section is silt loam or very fine sandy loam with a weighted average less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser and less than 18 percent clay. This material contains significant amounts of mica but less than 25 percent. Buried organic layers may occur at any depth or may be absent. Thin layers of mineral material coarser than very fine sandy loam may also occur at any depth. Reaction ranges from neutral in the surface to slightly alkaline in the substratum.\nThe O horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 2 to 3; and chroma of 1 to 3. It is slightly to highly decomposed plant material. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, 5GY, or N; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 1 to 2. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Ab horizon (where present) has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or 10Y; value of 3 to 4; and chroma 1 or 2. Texture is very fine sand, fine sand, loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam. Reaction ranges neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe Ob horizon (where present) has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is slightly to hightly decomposed plant material. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2C horizon (where present) has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sand, or sand with 0 to 70 percent coarse fragments. Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline."
