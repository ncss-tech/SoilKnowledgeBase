  "OVERVIEW": "The Philo series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on flood plains. They formed in recent alluvium derived mainly from sandstone and shale. Permeability is moderate to moderately rapid. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees  F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 48 inches. Some pedons have stratified sand and gravel at depth as shallow as 30 inches, however, the transition zone is 5 inches or more thick. In other pedons, medium-textured materials extends to depths of 5 feet or more. Depth to hard rock ranges from 60 inches to 12 feet or more.  In most pedons, rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent in the A, Bw, and C horizons, 0 to 40 percent in the 2C horizon, and average less than 20 percent in the particle size control section. Some pedons, have rock fragments in C horizons that range from 0 to 40 percent, and 2C horizons below 40 inches that range from 0 to 75 percent. Reaction when unlimed ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. If moist value is 3, either the dry value is more than 5.5 or the A horizon is less than 1/3 the thickness from the soil surface to the base of the Cambic horizon. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, and fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Low chroma redoximorphic features range from dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) to light gray (10YR 6/1). High chroma redoximorphic features range from dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) to strong brown (7.5YR 5/8). Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, and sandy loam. Some pedons have thin horizons where the fine-earth fraction is very fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have BC horizons with colors and textures similar to the Bw horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 6, and has redox features. Redoximorphic features are strong brown (7.5YR 5/6 or 7.5YR 5/8), yellowish red (5YR 4/6) or redder.  If matrix chroma is greater than 2, redoximorphic features have chroma of 2 or less. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, and sandy loam.\nTexture of the fine-earth fraction in the 2C horizon ranges from sand to silt loam."

The Buchanan, Cotaco and Ernest soils are moderately well drained soils on foot slopes and  colluvial fans. The Dekalb, Gilpin and Muskingum soils are well drained upland soils. Chenango and Alton soils are skeletal soils on adjacent terraces. The Holly and Papakating soils are more poorly drained alluvial soils."
