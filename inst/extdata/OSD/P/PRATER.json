Durango soils are 7.5YR and redder in the Bt horizon. Erramouspe, Hualapai, Jacee, Nogal, Paguate, Tinian, and Wilmac soils are moderately deep.  Hosta soils contain less than 5 percent coarse fragments in any horizon. Montecito and Teco soils have a calcic horizon and would be reclassified as Calcidic Haplustalfs."
