  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Prater series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium, and alluvium derived from shale and sandstone.  Prater soils are on canyons, hills, and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 10 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Durango soils are 7.5YR and redder in the Bt horizon. Erramouspe, Hualapai, Jacee, Nogal, Paguate, Tinian, and Wilmac soils are moderately deep.  Hosta soils contain less than 5 percent coarse fragments in any horizon. Montecito and Teco soils have a calcic horizon and would be reclassified as Calcidic Haplustalfs."
