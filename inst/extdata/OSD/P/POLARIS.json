  "REVDATE": "01/2012",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Polaris series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or slide deposits over residuum derived from interbedded shale, siltstone and sandstone.  These soils occur on hills, escarpments, ridges, landslides and eroded fan remnants.  Slopes are 4 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
