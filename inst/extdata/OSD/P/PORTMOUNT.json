  "OVERVIEW": "The Portmount series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  The Portmount soils are on fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
