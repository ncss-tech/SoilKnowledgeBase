  "OVERVIEW": "The Pecatonica series consists of well drained soils on till plains and moraines. They formed in a thin layer of loess or silty material and the underlying reddish paleosol that formed in loamy till. Slope ranges from 0 to 30 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches).",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of soil development ranges from 4 feet (1.2 m) to more than 8 feet (2.4 m) depending upon the amount of truncation of the paleosol before the loess was deposited. The soil formed in 15 to 25 inches (38 to 64 cm) of loess or silty material and in the underlying paleosol which formed in loamy till. Many of the properties of the 2BC horizon are assumed to have been inherited from an earlier soil forming regime. Where sola are more than 5 feet (1.5 m) thick, chroma is either less than 5 and hue is 7.5YR or redder, or clay content decreases more than 20 percent within depths of 60 inches (152 cm). The particle-size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent fine or coarser sand. Mineralogy of the particle-size control section is mixed, but the dominant clay mineral in the 2C horizon is illite, and illite is an important constituent in the clay fraction of the 2Bt horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. In uncultivated areas, A horizons less than 5 inches (13 cm) thick have hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silt loam. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe BE or Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silty clay loam or silt loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Hue of 5YR or redder is on faces of peds or in the matrix in some part of the 2Bt horizon. Texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam, sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs of these textures. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid except that in the lower part, the range includes slightly acid.\nThe 2C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6. It ranges from gravelly sandy loam to sandy loam or loam. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline."

Bluemont, Mandeville, Mifflin, Norden, Ott, and Whalan soils have a lithic or paralithic contact within a depth of 60 inches. Douds and Westville soils average more than 15 percent sand in the upper one-fourth of the series control section. Grellton, Kliever, Letort, Lindley, McHenry, and Renova soils lack hue as red as 5YR in the matrix or on faces of peds in some subhorizon in the middle part of the series control section. Nodine and Plumcreek soils have a poorly graded sand fraction in the lower one-half of the series control section. Kendallville, Theresa, and Wykoff soils are less than 40 inches (102 cm) to the base of soil development. Rockbridge soils average more than 35 percent rock fragments in some subhorizon in the lower one-half of the series control section."
