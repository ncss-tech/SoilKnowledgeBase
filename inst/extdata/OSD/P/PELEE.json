Depth to the lower boundary of the pumiceous upper part of the particle-size control section is 25 to 35 inches.  Rock fragments in the control section range from 5 to 20 percent.  The upper 25 to 35 inches of this soil is 60 percent or more by weight volcanic ash and pumice, the lower part is 30 to 60 perent volcanic ash.  The 15-bar water content (air-dry) is 3 to 10 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon had value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  The lower part has common to many medium distinct mottles with hue of 7.5YR or 5YR in most pedons.\nThe 2Bw horizon averages 40 to 80 percent pumice fragment and 5 to 20 percent andesitic pebbles.  It is loamy sand to coarse sand.  Iron stains on the pumice fragments have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and value of 4 or 5 moist.\nThe 3Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry.  Fragments of soft black scoria average from 10 to 35 percent.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand."

St. Helens in a Pelee soils profiles is: (1) fresh ash and pumice including the 176-year-old \"Layer T,\" (2) pumice of the 400-year-old \"Layer W\" and (3) ash, pumice and scoria of the 2,500-year-old \"B set.\"   The climate is characterized by cool, moist summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 130 to 140 inches including snow cover from November to June.  Average January temperature is 24 degrees F, average July temperature is 58 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 38 to 40 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 75 to 90 days."
