  "OVERVIEW": "The Pelee series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in stratified aerially deposited volcanic ash and pumice.  Pelee soils are on backslopes and ridgetops of mountains at elevations of 2,800 to 4,500 feet.  Slopes range from 5 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 135 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
