  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Poorma soils are on smooth, nearly level and gently sloping alluvial fans at elevations of 5,800 to 6,600 feet. Slopes are O to 4 percent. The soils formed in silty alluvium primarily from ignimbrites, limestone, and Miocene lacustrine sediments. The climate is cool, semiarid. The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 F., mean summer temperature is 60 to 62 F., and the frost-free season is approximately 100 days. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches, with most of it coming as snow."

Fanu and Holtle soils have mollic epipedons.  Fanu soils also lack durinodes. Holsine soils have calcic horizons and lack durinodes, Usine soils have very gravelly sandy control sections."
