  "STATES": "ID,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pokey series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on low stream terraces and floodplains.  They formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and rapid in the substratum.  Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
