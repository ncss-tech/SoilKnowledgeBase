  "OVERVIEW": "The Pegasus series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from monzonite.  Pegasus soils are on beveled summits, shoulders, and backslopes of low hills.  Slopes are 20 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
