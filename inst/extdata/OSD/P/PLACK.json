  "OVERVIEW": "The Plack series consists of well drained, moderately permeable soils that are shallow or very shallow over an indurated caliche layer. These soils formed in a thin mantle of loamy eolian sediments of Pleistocene age over indurated caliche of Pliocene age. They occur on nearly level to gently sloping eolian plains. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 483 mm (19 in), and the mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degree F).",
