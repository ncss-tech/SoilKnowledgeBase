  "OVERVIEW": "The Pattani series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from tuff.  The Pattani soils are on hills and rock pediments.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
