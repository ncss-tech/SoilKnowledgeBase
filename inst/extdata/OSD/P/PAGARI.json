Eenreed soils are very deep and are 7 to 16 inches to the Bk horizon.  Kancan soils are very deep and have a lithologic discontinuity below the argillic horizon.  Mountainville soils are moderately or strongly alkaline in the calcic horizon and rock fragments in the soil are dominated by stones.  Selti soils are very deep and have less than 60 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon.  Red Butte soils are less than 20 inches deep to the base of the argillic and are weakly to strongly cemented in the calcic horizon.  Walsey soils are moderately deep."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pagari soils are on basalt plains.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 4,400 feet to 4,800 feet.  The soil formed in eolian material over basalt.  The climate is semi-arid with annual precipitation of 10 to 13 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rain.  The annual air temperature is about 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost free season is 90 to 120 days."

Rehfield soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Cos, Deerhorn, McCarey, Pedleford, and Wildors soils occur on convex positions on basalt plains.
