  "OVERVIEW": "The Pagari series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material.  Pagari soils are on basalt plains and have slopes of 2 to 15 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
