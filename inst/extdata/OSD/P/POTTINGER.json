It is dry the rest of the year. Organic matter is 1.0 to 3.0 percent to 20 inches and decreases regularly with depth. Shale fragments occupy 35 to 60 percent of the soil profile. Mean annual soil temperature is 64 degrees to 66 degrees F. Clay content of the soil ranges from 25 to 35 percent. The moisture regime is xeric but borders on aridic.\nThe A horizon has dry colors of 10YR 5/3, 5/2 or 4/2, moist colors are 10YR 2/2 or 3/2. It is very shaly clay loam or very shaly sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon has dry colors of 10YR 6/2 or 6/3, moist colors are 10YR 4/2 or 4/3. it is very shaly clay loam or very shaly sandy clay loam."

Anaheim, Agueda, Conejo, Gazos and Reward soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments. Aramburu soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches. Gamboa soils are mesic. Millrace soils are developed from stratified coarse alluvium from basalt and andesite and have clay contents less than 18 percent."

Elevations are 1,500 to 3,000 feet.  The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 0 to 11 inches. Mean January temperature is 46 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 83 degrees F.; mean annual temperature varies from 62 degrees to 64 degrees F. Frost-free is 200 to 250 days."
