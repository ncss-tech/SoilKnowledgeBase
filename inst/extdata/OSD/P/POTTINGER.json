  "OVERVIEW": "The Pottinger series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in shaly alluvium from sedimentary rock sources. Pottinger soils are on alluvial fans and terraces and have slopes of 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 9 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is 62 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil between the depths of about 11 to 33 inches is usually moist in some part from November through april and moist in all parts at least January and February. It is dry the rest of the year. Organic matter is 1.0 to 3.0 percent to 20 inches and decreases regularly with depth. Shale fragments occupy 35 to 60 percent of the soil profile. Mean annual soil temperature is 64 degrees to 66 degrees F. Clay content of the soil ranges from 25 to 35 percent. The moisture regime is xeric but borders on aridic.\nThe A horizon has dry colors of 10YR 5/3, 5/2 or 4/2, moist colors are 10YR 2/2 or 3/2. It is very shaly clay loam or very shaly sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon has dry colors of 10YR 6/2 or 6/3, moist colors are 10YR 4/2 or 4/3. it is very shaly clay loam or very shaly sandy clay loam."
