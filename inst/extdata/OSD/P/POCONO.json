  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 70 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Rock fragments of mostly gravel size conglomerate, quartzite or sandstone ranges from 15 to 40 percent in the A horizon, from 10 to 70 percent in individual horizons of the B, and averages from 35 to 50 percent in the top 20 inches of the argillic horizon.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout the soil, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Texture is loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Texture is loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Texture is loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction commonly with less than 20 percent clay.  Structure is commonly blocky or subangular blocky.  Some pedons have thin Bx or Bh horizons and some pedons have unconforming reddish, clay loam 2Bt2 horizons below a depth of 40 inches."
