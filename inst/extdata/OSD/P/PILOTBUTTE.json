    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 90 days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 2 to 5 percent clay.  The solum has phosphate retention of 25 to 40 percent, acid oxalate aluminum plus half the iron of 0.4 to 0.7 and 50 to 90 percent glass.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick.  Base saturation by ammonium acetate throughout the solum is 65 to 80 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 0 to 5 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  The sand-size (0.25 to 1.0mm) pumice content ranges from 10 to 20 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  The upper part is ashy sandy loam or ashy loamy sand, the lower part is ashy loamy sand or ashy sand and contains 0 to 5 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  The sand-size (0.25 to 1.0mm) pumice content ranges from 20 to 30 percent.  Base saturation by sum of cations is less than 75 percent throughout.\nThe C horizon has value of 6 or 7 moist, 7 or 8 dry, and chroma of  4 or 5 moist and 1 or 2 dry.  It contains 0 to 5 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles. The sand-size (0.25 to 1.0mm) pumice content ranges from 25 to 40 percent  It has over 60 percent glass, has phosphate retention of 5 to 25 percent and 0.1 to 0.4 acid oxalate."

Laidlaw soils have a 10 to 19 inch thick mollic epipedon.  Lundgren soils have a 10 to 20 inch thick mollic epipedon and are 20 to 40 inches deep to glacial outwash material.  Retep and Wanoga soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Suttle soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a umbric epipedon."

The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches, the mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."
