    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 61 degrees F to 68 degrees F and the soil temperature remains above 47 degrees F at all times.  The 6 to 17 inch soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from May 15 to October 31 and moist in all parts from November 15 to May l.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/6, 5/4, 5/3, 5/2, 4/3; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/2, 4/4, 4/2; or 5YR 5/6 and moist color of 10YR 3/4, 3/3, 3/2; 7.5YR 3/4, 3/3, 3/2; 5YR 3/3, 3/4, or 3/6.  Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loam and gravel ranges from 1 percent to as much as 35 percent.  In untilled areas the organic matter is 1.5 to 7 percent in the upper 4 inches, but decreases to less than 1 percent 7 to 10 inches below the surface.  The A horizon is hard or very hard and is massive in some or all parts.  It is medium acid to neutral.  Some pedons have a gradual or diffuse boundary between the A horizon and the Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 4/4, 5/6; 5YR 6/4, 5/6, 5/4, 4/6, 4/8; 2.5YR 5/6, 5/4, 4/6 or 4/4 and moist color of 5YR 5/4, 4/6, 4/4, 3/6, 3/4; 2.5YR 4/4, 4/6, 3/6 or 3/4.  The upper part of the horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 5/6, 5/4 or 3/4 and moist color of 4/6, 4/4 or 3/4.  Texture is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, gravelly loam, gravelly clay loam, gravelly sandy clay loam, or very gravelly sandy clay loam and averages 25 to 35 percent clay and 5 to 35 percent gravel.  The horizon has weak prismatic, moderate or strong angular or subangular blocky structure.  It is neutral to medium acid and base saturation is 75 to 100 percent.  Some pedons have 35 to 50 percent gravel and 5 to 15 percent cobbles below a depth of 40 inches.\nThe BC or C horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 4/6; 5YR 5/6 or 4/6 and moist color of 7.5YR 4/6, 3/4; 5YR 4/6, 3/4; or 2.5YR 3/6.  This horizon is stratified with textures of clay loam, loam, sandy clay loam or sandy loam or their gravelly, cobbly very gravelly or very cobbly equivalents with 10 to 30 percent clay and 5 to 65 percent coarse fragments.  Some thin individual strata are relatively gravel free.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons lack BC or C horizons."

Bellyspring soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to paralithic sandstone bedrock. Coarsegold soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Hicksville soils lack 5YR and 2.5YR hues. Pleasanton soils have less than 25 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon. Redsluff soils have less than 10 percent clay and greater than 60 percent rock fragments in the C horizon.  Rescue and Olashes soils lack rock fragments in the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Perkins soils are on terraces.  Slope is 0 to 30 percent but usually have slopes of less than 9 percent.  Elevation is 50 to 1,700 feet.  They formed in alluvium from a variety of rock sources, including sedimentary, granitic, and metamorphosed acid- igneous rock. The climate has hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 43 inches.  Average January temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F., average July temperature is 71 to 80 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 58 to 65 degrees F.  The freeze-free season is 230 to 310 days."

Cometa and Corning soils have more than 35 percent clay and have an abrupt A-Bt horizon boundary.  Cortina soils lack an argillic horizon and have more than 35 percent rock fragments.
