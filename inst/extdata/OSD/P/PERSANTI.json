    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 60 to more than 80 inches.   The soil is very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A, E and upper part of the B horizons and extremely acid to strongly acid throughout the rest of the profile.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe BA or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is clay loam, sandy clay loam, or rarely silty clay loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8 with common to many mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray.  Mottles of chroma 2 or less are 15 to 30 inches from the surface.  The lower part of the Bt horizon commonly is mottled in shades of brown, yellow, red, or gray, or it is dominantly gray with brown, yellow, or red mottles.  The Bt horizon is clay or silty clay.  Consistence is firm, or very firm, hard, or very hard.\nThe BC horizon, where present, commonly is mottled in shades of brown, yellow, red, or gray, or it is dominantly gray with brown, yellow, or red mottles.  It is clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Duplin series is the only other known series in this family.  Duplin soils have moderate subangular blocky structure and do not have significant amounts of vermiculite in the Bt horizon.  Similar soils in related families are the Angie, Caroline, Craven, Nevarc, Shubuta, Smithboro, and Tiak series.  Angie, Caroline, Craven, Nevarc, Shubuta, and Tiak have mixed mineralogy.  In addition Craven soils have a solum 40 to 60 inches thick, or they have a clay decrease of more than 20 percent within 60 inches.  Smithboro soils have dominant chroma of 2 or less from the base of the A or Ap horizon and 30 inches."

The soil formed in unconsolidated, dominantly clayey Coastal Plain and fluvial sediments.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 70 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 52 inches, and frost free days range from 190 to 245."

Cantey, Coxville, Dunbar have dominant chroma of 2 or less from the base of the A or Ap horizon and 30 inches.  Noboco, Norfolk, Orangeburg, Red Bay, and Summerton soils are on higher landscapes and do not have mottles with chroma of 2 or less within 30 inches of the surface."
