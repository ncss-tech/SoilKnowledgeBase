  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 30 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Depth to the top of the dense substratum ranges from 20 to 30 inches. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam or silt loam throughout with more than 60 percent silt plus very fine sand. Rock fragments consist of dark phyllite, slate, shale, and schist and range from 5 to 25 percent by volume in the surface and subsoil layers, and 10 to 35 percent in the substratum. Depth to redoximorphic features range from 6 to 14 inches. The soil is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium granular. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3 in the upper part, and in the lower part has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. There is distinct or prominent redoximorphic features. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 3. Consistence is firm or very firm. Structure is platy or the material is massive."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Busti and Ridgebury series are in the same family. Busti soils lack a Cd horizon. Ridgebury soils have a sandier texture and contain less than 60 percent silt plus very fine sand throughout.\nJamestown, Kilmangh, Orpark, and Painesville series are in related families. Jamestown, Kilmangh, Orpark, and Painesville soils are in the fine-loamy family. In addition, Orpark soils are more acid than Punsit soils."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Punsit soils are nearly level to sloping soils on glaciated uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The soils developed in loamy glacial till derived primarily from dark phyllite, slate, shale or schist. Mean annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches; and the frost free period is 120 to 180 days. The elevation ranges from 150 to 1200 feet."

Blasdell and Hoosic soils are on nearby outwash plains, terraces, eskers, and kames. Well drained Stockbridge and Dutchess soils which lack a dense substratum, shallow Nassau soils, and moderately deep Manlius and Cardigan soils are closely associated on the uplands."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Original classification placed Punsit in the great group of Haplaquepts. Because of changes established in the 5th and 6th editions of `Keys to Soil Taxonomy' this soil now classifies in the new great group of Epiaquepts. Competing series may change as similar soils are reclassified. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon - from the surface to a depth of 6 inches (Ap horizon).\n2.  Cambic horizon - from 6 to 23 inches (Bg1 and Bg2 horizons).\n3.  Aquic moisture conditions - evidenced by low chroma reduced matrix color and iron oxide concentrations in the Bg horizon.\n4.  Aeric subgroup - evidenced by 50 percent or more high chroma (value and chroma of 3 or more) colors in the Bg1 horizon.\nSoil Interpretation Record No: NY0350\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
