  "OVERVIEW": "The Pasopeak series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from rhyolite and altered granitic rock.  The Pasopeak soils are on summits and sideslopes of hills and mountains with slopes of 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees and the mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches.",
