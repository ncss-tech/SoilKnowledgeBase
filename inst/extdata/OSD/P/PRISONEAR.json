  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Prisonear series consists of moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sands over alluvium from limestone. Prisonear soils are on sand sheets over fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
