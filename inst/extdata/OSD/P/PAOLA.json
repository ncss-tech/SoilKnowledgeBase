  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Paola series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in sandy marine sediments.  Paola soils are on hills, ridges, and flats on marine terraces. Slopes are linear to convex and range from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 1397 millimeters (55 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C (72 degrees F).",
