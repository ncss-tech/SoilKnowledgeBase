  "OVERVIEW": "The Pluto series consists of moderately deep or deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from basalt. Pluto soils are on the plains of lava fields. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
