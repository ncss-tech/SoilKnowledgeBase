  "OVERVIEW": "The Palon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from rhyolite.  Palon soils are on mountain slopes and summits.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
