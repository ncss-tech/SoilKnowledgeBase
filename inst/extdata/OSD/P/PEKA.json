Borgeau soils have a particle-size control section that averages 10 to 18 percent clay.  Emily soils have a mollic epipedon that is 20 to 36 inches thick.  Lenz, Raisio, and Vanbrunt soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Louiccreek soils have 8 to 15 percent clay in the particle-size control section and the base saturation (by sum) 75 to 100 percent except in the upper part of the A horizon.  Speigle soils have 10 to 20 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Peka soils are on backslopes, footslopes, and toe-slopes of glaciated mountains. These soils formed in colluvium from glacial till with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface. Slopes are 15 to 65 percent and are mainly south or west-facing. Elevations range from 2,800 to 4,500 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches. The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F.; mean July temperature is about 68 degrees F.; and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
