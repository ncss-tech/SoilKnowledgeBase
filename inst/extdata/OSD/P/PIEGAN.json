  "OVERVIEW": "The Piegan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or till over residuum. These soils occur on nivation hollows on ridges, mountain slopes and glacial-valley walls. Slopes are 8 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1,825 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 2.0 degrees C.",
