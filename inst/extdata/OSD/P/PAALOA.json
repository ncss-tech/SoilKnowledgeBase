  "OVERVIEW": "The Paaloa series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from alluvium and basic igneous rock.  Paaloa soils are on uplands and have slopes of 2 to 12 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 80 inches and mean annual temperature is about 70 degrees F.",

The Ap horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 through 4 dry.  A horizon is silty clay or clay.  One- to four-inch chunks of soil high in titanium oxide are common in the A horizon.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 10R, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry or moist.  It is silty clay or clay."

Kokee soils have 7.5YR or 10YR hue in the argillic horizon.  Leilehua soils are extremely acid throughout the solum and have thin patchy clay films throughout the argillic horizon.  Makawao soils are slightly acid and weakly smeary in the argillic horizon and have thin clay films in the argillic horizon.  Olelo soils have strong structure and continuous moderately thick clay films in the lower part of the argillic horizon."

Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent and are nearly everywhere convex except for the toeslopes which are concave.  These soils formed in alluvium and residuum weathered from basic igneous rocks.  Mean annual rainfall is 70 to 90 inches.  Average January temperature is 67 degrees F.; average July temperature is 73 degrees F.; and mean annual temperature is about 70 degrees F."

Kapaa soils have an oxic horizon that has a high concentration of gibbsite.  Manana soils lack clay films in the upper part of the B horizon and have a thin panlike layer at depths of 15 to 50 inches.  Wahiawa soils lack an argillic horizon."
