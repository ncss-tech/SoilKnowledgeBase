Content of slate channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the A horizon and from 0 to 10 percent in the Bt horizon.  The soil is extremely acid to strongly acid in the A and upper Bt horizons, except where the surface layer has been limed, and very strongly acid to moderately acid in the lower Bt and BC horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is loam or silt loam.\nThe upper Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe lower Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8, or it is mottled without dominant matrix color.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8, or it is without dominant matrix and mottled in shades of red, brown, yellow and gray.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered and fractured Carolina slate or other fine-grained rock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes commonly are 2 to 6 percent, but range from 0 to 6 percent.  The soils formed in material weathered from Carolina slate or other fine-grained bedrock.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 48 to 50 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 62 degrees.  The growing season ranges from 210 to 225 days."

Alamance and Kirksey soils are on similar landscapes and are more than 40 inches to weathered bedrock.  Badin soils are on convex areas, have a clayey particle-size control section and are Ultisols.  Goldston soils are on convex ridge tops and steeper side slopes, have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section and have weathered bedrock at a depth of 10 to 20 inches."
