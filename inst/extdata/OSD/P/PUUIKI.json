  "OVERVIEW": "The Puuiki series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in organic material mixed with basic volcanic ash over pahoehoe lava.   Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 890 millimeters (35 inches), and the mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C. (54 degrees F.)",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Puuiki soils are on upper elevation, leeward slopes of Hualalai volcano at elevations from 1067 to 1829 meters (3500 to 6000 feet).  These soils are in depressions of constructional landscapes consisting of nearly level to steep pahoehoe flows that are less than 5,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 40 percent.  The soils formed in organic material consisting of decomposed leaves, twigs, wood; and to a lesser extent basic volcanic ash, cinders, and weathered lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 760 to 1020 millimeters (30 to 40 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from January through July.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1270 to 1520 millimeters (50 to 60 degrees).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 14 degrees C. (50 to 57 degrees F.)  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)"
