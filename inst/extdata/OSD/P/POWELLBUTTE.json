  "OVERVIEW": "The Powellbutte series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt and tuff with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface. Powellbutte soils are on hillsopes and plateaus and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F. The A and AB horizons have a phosphate retention of 15 to 25 percent, acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron of 0.4 to 0.8 percent and 15 to 30 percent glass. Depth to the 2Bt horizon is 7 to 14 inches. Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick. The particle-size control section averages 30 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It contains 10 to 40 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones.\nThe AB horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It is ashy loam or ashy clay loam and contains 10 to 20 percent gravel and 20 to 30 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. It is clay loam or clay and contains 5 to 35 percent gravel and 27 to 45 percent clay. Clay texture occurs in the horizon immediately above the bedrock."
