    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to soft shale or siltstone and thickness of the solum is 10 to 20 inches. Depth to shale bedrock is greater than 20 inches. Rock fragments, mostly channers, range from 15 to 35 percent in the A and E horizons and from 35 percent to 80 percent in the Bw horizon. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Fine-earth texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Fine-earth texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 or 6. Fine-earth texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Cr horizon is weakly to moderately cemented shale and siltstone that can be excavated by hand tools and is commonly interbedded.\nThe R horizon is strongly cemented, but may be ripped by heavy equipment due to the interbedded nature of the parent materials and may be absent in some pedons."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Cataska series is the only other member in this family. Cataska soils formed in material weathered from slate or phyllite and have more than 30 percent weatherable minerals such as chlorite, sericite, and hydrobiotite. Other soils in closely related families include the Berks, Dekalb, Litz, Montevallo, Muskingum, and Weikert series. Berks and DeKalb soils have sola greater than 20 inches thick.  Litz soils have thin intermittent argillic horizons. Montevallo soils are in the thermic temperature regime. Muskingum soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments and sola thicker than 20 inches. Weikert soils are less than 20 inches to hard bedrock."
