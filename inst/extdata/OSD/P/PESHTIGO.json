    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (Unless otherwise stated, depth is measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and depth to free carbonates range from 40 to 70 inches.  The weighted average clay content ranges from 18 to 30 percent and the weighted average content of fine sand or coarser ranges from 20 to 50 percent in the particle-size control section.  Rock fragments are a mixture of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary.  The sedimentary rocks are mostly dolomite.  Volume of gravel ranges from 2 to 10 percent and volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the soil .  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part of the solum and from strongly acid to neutral in the lower part.  The substratum is slightly or moderately alkaline and calcareous.  Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are within the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon and saturation occurs there at some time in most years.\nSome pedons have a thin O horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is a mat of partially decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon, below the Bw horizon.  It has color and texture like the E horizon described above.\nPeshtigo soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E horizon above. The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Typically, it is clay loam or loam."

Meadland, Milladore, Point, and Withee soils do not have limestone rock fragments, are more acid than slightly alkaline in the substratum, and do not have free carbonates in the substratum.  In addition, Milladore and Withee soils have more than 50 percent silt in the upper part of the series control section.  Rietbrock soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches.  Sprinkler soils are brittle in the glossic horizon."

The somewhat poorly drained Iosco soils, the moderately well drained Morganlake soils, and the well drained Menominee soils form a drainage sequence on nearby areas where there is a 20 to 40 inch thick sandy mantle over the till. The moderately well drained Keshena soils and the well drained Tilleda soils form a drainage sequence with Peshtigo soils."

Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum, moderately slow or moderate in the lower part of the solum, and moderately slow in the substratum.  Peshtigo soils have a perched seasonal high water table at depths of 1 to 2.5 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period of September to June in 6 or more out of 10 years."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are mostly in woodland.  Timber stands are mostly red maple, northern red oak, and eastern white pine with sugar maple, American basswood, white ash, American hornbeam, American beech, and eastern hemlock as associates in most stands.  White oak is an associate in some stands.  Some areas are cleared and used for cropland.  Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay.  Some areas are used for pastureland."
