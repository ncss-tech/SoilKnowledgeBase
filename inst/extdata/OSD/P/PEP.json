(Bkk horizon)\nPlugged (kk) horizon: 81 to 203 cm (32 to 80 in). (Bkk horizon)\nNote: the kk feature is defined as pedogenic carbonate accumulation that is characterized by laterally continuous carbonates that have engulfed rock, sand, silt, and clay particles; plugged the macro porosity of the soil horizon with 50 percent or more calcium carbonate; and obliterated the original soil structure.\nADDITIONAL DATA: none\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
