  "OVERVIEW": "The Pep series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy eolian sediments in the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains and side slopes above playas and along draws. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 483 mm (19 in), and mean annual temperature is 16 Degrees C (61 degrees F).",

(Bkk horizon)\nPlugged (kk) horizon: 81 to 203 cm (32 to 80 in). (Bkk horizon)\nNote: the kk feature is defined as pedogenic carbonate accumulation that is characterized by laterally continuous carbonates that have engulfed rock, sand, silt, and clay particles; plugged the macro porosity of the soil horizon with 50 percent or more calcium carbonate; and obliterated the original soil structure.\nADDITIONAL DATA: none\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
