  "OVERVIEW": "The Penalto series consists of soils that are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon.  They are well drained moderately permeable soils over a very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon.  They formed in gravelly slope alluvium from limestone.  These soils are on hills.  Slope ranges from 5 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F.",
