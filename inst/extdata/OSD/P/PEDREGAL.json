  "OVERVIEW": "The Pedregal series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum derived from granitic sandstone, siltstone, and fanglomerate.  Pedregal soils are on summits and shoulders of erosional fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
