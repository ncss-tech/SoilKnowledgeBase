  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Potatolake series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that have formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of lacustrine sediments over glacial outwash. These soils are on nearly level to steep areas on glacial lake plains, moraines, and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 635 millimeters.",
