Conconully and Stevens soils are 20 to 40 inches to densic materials (Cd horizon). Deno and Cabincreek soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Doublecreek soils have 10 percent cobbles in the upper subsoil and cobbles and stones in the substratum. Fanal soils are moderately well drained with redox concentrations in the lower part of the particle-size control section. Uhlig soils typically have silt loam textures in the particle-size control section and lack a loamy sand or sand substratum at depths of 30 to 60 inches. Safety soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."

Potential natural vegetation in Washington is scattered ponderosa pine and an understory of common snowberry, dwarf rose, creeping Oregon-grape, pinegrass, blue wildrye, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Idaho fescue. In Utah, all of these soils are cultivated. The native vegetation is assumed to have been range."
