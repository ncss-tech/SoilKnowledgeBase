Some pedons have a few granitic cobbles and pebbles on the surface and throughout the solum. The particle size control section averages between 18 and 32 percent clay. Typically there are strata in the horizon above the glacial till. Strata ranges in texture from loam to silty clay loam and are 10 to 50 mm in thickness. Clay loam glacial till is between depths of 102 and 152 centimeters (40 and 60 inches) in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1. It typically is silty clay loam, but is silt loam or clay loam in some pedons. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4. It typically is silty clay loam or silt loam. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral in the upper part and neutral or slightly alkaline in the lower part. Some pedons have a thin BC horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silty clay loam or silt loam. It has common or many accumulations of carbonates. It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Some pedons do not have a 2C horizon."

Great Bend soils are varved with thin layers of sand to clay at a depth of 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches). Varves range from less than 1 mm to 10 mm in thickness. Kings Lake and Kranzburg soils have glacial till between depths of 51 and 102 centimeters (20 and 40 inches).Kranzburg and Still Lake soils also do not have the strata above the glacial till. Putney soils have gypsum and other salts within depths of 51 centimeters (20 inches)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Poinsett soils are nearly level to gently rolling on uplands having plane to convex slopes with gradients of 0 to 15 percent. Poinsett soils formed in calcareous silty glacial drift. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C (38 to 45 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 485 to 735 millimeters (19 to 29 inches). Growing season is about 120 to 160 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 330 to 457 millimeters (13 to 18 inches); and growing degree days are about 2500 to 3000. Elevation ranges from 1000 to 2150 feet."

The somewhat poorly drained Badger soils have a fine textured control section and are in deeper swales. The well drained Barnes and Forman soils are fine-loamy and are on adjacent till plains. In addition, Forman soils also have an argillic horizon. The well drained Buse and Rusklyn soils are on shoulder slopes and do not have a cambic horizon. The somewhat poorly drained Cubden soils have a calcic horizon within 41 centimeters (16 inches) of the surface and are along the edges of deeper swales and closed depressions. The well drained Hetland and Sinai soils have a fine textured control section and are on higher lying ice-walled lake positions in the silty drift landscape. The well drained Kings Lake soils have glacial till between 51 and 102 centimeters (20 and 40 inches) and are on similar landscape positions as the Poinsett soils. The very poorly drained Oldham and Parnell soils and the poorly drained Tonka soils have fine textured control sections and are in closed depressions. Waubay soils have mollic epipedons more than 41 centimeters (16 inches) thick and are on footslopes and in swales."
