The somewhat poorly drained Badger soils have a fine textured control section and are in deeper swales. The well drained Barnes and Forman soils are fine-loamy and are on adjacent till plains. In addition, Forman soils also have an argillic horizon. The well drained Buse and Rusklyn soils are on shoulder slopes and do not have a cambic horizon. The somewhat poorly drained Cubden soils have a calcic horizon within 41 centimeters (16 inches) of the surface and are along the edges of deeper swales and closed depressions. The well drained Hetland and Sinai soils have a fine textured control section and are on higher lying ice-walled lake positions in the silty drift landscape. The well drained Kings Lake soils have glacial till between 51 and 102 centimeters (20 and 40 inches) and are on similar landscape positions as the Poinsett soils. The very poorly drained Oldham and Parnell soils and the poorly drained Tonka soils have fine textured control sections and are in closed depressions. Waubay soils have mollic epipedons more than 41 centimeters (16 inches) thick and are on footslopes and in swales."
