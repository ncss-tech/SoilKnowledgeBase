  "OVERVIEW": "The Petrel series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, poorly drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from igneous and noncalcareous sedimentary rocks.  Petrel soils are on backslopes and footslopes of hills and mountain toeslopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 112 inches and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

The depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The gravel and cobble content in the particle size control section ranges from 35 to 75 percent.  Reaction is extremely or very strongly acid in the upper part of the profile but ranges to strongly acid in the lower part.\nAn A or E horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe B/E horizon has matrix hue from 5YR to 10YR, value from 2.5 to 4, and chroma from 1 to 6.  Texture is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.  Coarse fragment content includes 0 to 25 percent cobble and 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe E/B horizon has matrix hue from 5YR to 10YR, value from 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles have hue from 5YR to 10YR, value from 2.5 to 5, and chroma from 1 through 8.  Texture is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.  Coarse fragment content includes 0 to 25 percent cobble and 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nA BC horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe C and 2C horizons have hue ranging from 10YR to 5GY, value from 4 to 6, and chroma from 1 to 6.  Texture is loam or fine sandy loam with 35 to 75 percent coarse fragments, including 5 to 40 percent cobble and 30 to 60 percent gravel."
