The depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The gravel and cobble content in the particle size control section ranges from 35 to 75 percent.  Reaction is extremely or very strongly acid in the upper part of the profile but ranges to strongly acid in the lower part.\nAn A or E horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe B/E horizon has matrix hue from 5YR to 10YR, value from 2.5 to 4, and chroma from 1 to 6.  Texture is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.  Coarse fragment content includes 0 to 25 percent cobble and 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe E/B horizon has matrix hue from 5YR to 10YR, value from 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles have hue from 5YR to 10YR, value from 2.5 to 5, and chroma from 1 through 8.  Texture is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.  Coarse fragment content includes 0 to 25 percent cobble and 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nA BC horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe C and 2C horizons have hue ranging from 10YR to 5GY, value from 4 to 6, and chroma from 1 to 6.  Texture is loam or fine sandy loam with 35 to 75 percent coarse fragments, including 5 to 40 percent cobble and 30 to 60 percent gravel."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Petrel soils are on backslopes and footslopes of rolling hills and infrequently dissected mountain sideslopes.  Petrel soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from igneous and noncalcareous detrital sedimentary rocks, and are underlain by these rocks at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  The climate is humid maritime with mean annual precipitation of 112 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F."

Tolstoi soils are shallow, well drained soils on backslopes of mountains and hills.  Wadleigh soils are formed in glacial till and are on backslopes and footslopes of hills.  Remedios soils are deep, well drained soils on footslopes and toeslopes."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  The Petrel soils are used for timber production, watershed protection, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  The climax forest overstory vegetation is dominantly western hemlock, with lesser amounts of Sitka spruce and Alaska cedar.  The understory vegetation is dominantly blueberry and huckleberry species, deer cabbage, yellow skunkcabbage, fernleaf goldthread, and heartleaf twayblade."
