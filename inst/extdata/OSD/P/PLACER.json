  "OVERVIEW": "The Placer series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in residuum from Saddle Mountain basalt, with a thin mantle of volcanic ash. They are on hills on plateaus. Permeability is moderate and slopes range from 15 to 40 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 37 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
