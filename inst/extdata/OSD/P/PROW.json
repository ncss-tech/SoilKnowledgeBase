    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 38 degrees to 41 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature is 55 degrees to 58 degrees F. Depth to soft marlstone is 6 to 20 inches. Calcium carbonate equivalent for the matrix material in coarse fragments less than 20 mm.  in diameter is more than 40 percent. Marlstone channery fragments, mostly less than 20 mm. in diameter, range from 15 to 35 percent. The A and C horizons have hue of 2.5Y through 10YR; value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist; and chroma of 2 or 3. These horizons are channery silt loam or channery silty clay loam. These horizons are moderately or strongly alkaline."
