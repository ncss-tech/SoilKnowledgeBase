    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Angular quartz gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout.  The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout unless limed.  Flakes of mica range from few to many and usually increase with depth.\nThe A horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 3.  It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, is neutral or has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bt horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7 and chroma of 0 through 2.  It commonly has high chroma mottles.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe BC horizon, where present, is neutral or has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7 and chroma of 0 through 2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe C horizon colors are variable and are commonly mottled in shades of gray, olive, yellow, and brown.  It is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or loam.  Some pedons have stone lines in the C horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Partlow soils are in depressions, along drainageways, and on toe slopes in the Southern Piedmont.  Slopes are commonly concave and range in gradient from 0 to 7 percent.  The soils formed in local colluvial and alluvial materials derived from granite, gneiss, and schist.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 59 to 66 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 46 inches."

The Abell and Colfax soils are on similar landscape positions and do not have gray matrix colors throughout the solum."

These soils were included with the Worsham soils in the past.  They were correlated as a fine-loamy Variant of the Myatt series (siliceous) in Hanover County, Virginia.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon-the zone from 0 to 14 inches (A and E horizons)\n2.  Argillic horizon-the zone from 14 to 55 inches (Btg horizons)\n3.
