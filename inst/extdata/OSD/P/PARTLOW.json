  "OVERVIEW": "The Partlow series consists of deep, poorly drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in local colluvial and alluvial materials derived from granite, gneiss, and schist.  These soils are in depressions, on toe slopes, and along drainageways in the Southern Piedmont Plateau.  Slopes are concave and range in gradient from 0 to 7 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",

Angular quartz gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout.  The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout unless limed.  Flakes of mica range from few to many and usually increase with depth.\nThe A horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 3.  It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, is neutral or has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bt horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7 and chroma of 0 through 2.  It commonly has high chroma mottles.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe BC horizon, where present, is neutral or has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7 and chroma of 0 through 2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe C horizon colors are variable and are commonly mottled in shades of gray, olive, yellow, and brown.  It is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or loam.  Some pedons have stone lines in the C horizon."

These soils were included with the Worsham soils in the past.  They were correlated as a fine-loamy Variant of the Myatt series (siliceous) in Hanover County, Virginia.  The soil horizon depths were revised on 10/2021 to ensure the description began at the soil surface.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon-the zone from 0 to 15 inches (O, A and E horizons)\n2.  Argillic horizon-the zone from 15 to 56 inches (Btg horizons)\n3.  Gleyed feature-matrix chroma of 2 or less in the subsoil\nSIR = VA0153\nMLRA = 136\nREVISED = 1/23/90"
