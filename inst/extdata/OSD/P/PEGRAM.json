  "OVERVIEW": "The Pegram series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium with some loess influence. They are on fan remnants and stream terraces.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Pegram soils have slopes of 1 to 4 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Rexburg soils have a coarse-silty particle size control section and contain less than 18 percent clay.  Buist soils are on similar landscape positions as Pegram, but are higher on the fan terrace or on slightly higher, convex positions.  Georgecanyon soils are downhill from Pegram soils. Rexburg soils are on higher positions than Pegram soils."
