Average annual precipitation is 13 to 18 inches, average annual soil temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F., the frost free period is 70 to 100 days."

Georgecanyon soils have a loamy-skeletal particle size control section and are effervescent to the surface.  Rexburg soils have a coarse-silty particle size control section and contain less than 18 percent clay.  Buist soils are on similar landscape positions as Pegram, but are higher on the fan terrace or on slightly higher, convex positions.  Georgecanyon soils are downhill from Pegram soils. Rexburg soils are on higher positions than Pegram soils."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Border series was correlated to the Pegram series at the March, 1990, Bear Lake-Caribou progress review due to a lack of separation criteria.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 14 inches (the Ap and BA horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 14 to 39 inches (the Bt1, Bt2 and Btk horizons).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 28 to 50 inches (the Btk and 2Bk1 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 14 inches to the 34 inches (the Bt1, Bt2 and part of the Btk horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
