  "OVERVIEW": "The Promontory series consists of very shallow and shallow to a hardpan, well drained soils formed in alluvium from rhyolite. Promontory soils are on mesas and plateaus. Slopes range from 3 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
