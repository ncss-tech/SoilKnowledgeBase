    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  Depth to hard limestone bedrock is more than 72 inches. Few or common fine dark colored oxide concretions or stains are throughout the soil in most pedons.  Rock fragments, commonly chert or limestone, range from 0 to 5 percent in the A, E, and BE horizons, and from 0 to 15 percent in the Bt or C horizons.  The soil is strongly acid to slightly acid, unless limed.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam.\nThe Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Mottles or streaks with a hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8 are in the lower part of the Bt horizon in most pedons.  The Bt horizon is clay or silty clay.  The particle-size control section averages less than 35 percent silt or more than 15 percent sand.  Many faces of peds in the Bt horizon have patchy dark colored oxide coatings or patchy yellowish red or red films of clay.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Mottles or streaks with a hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8 are in most pedons.  The BC horizon is clay or silty clay.  Many faces of peds in the Bt horizon have patchy dark colored oxide coatings or patchy yellowish red or red films of clay.\nThe C horizon is mottled or streaked in hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam."
