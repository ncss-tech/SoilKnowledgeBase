  "OVERVIEW": "The Perdin series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from serpentinitic and peridotite rocks. Perdin soils are on broad ridgetops and side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 5 to 90 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Depth to the paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  Rock fragments in the particle-size control section average 15 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Hue is 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  Rock fragments average 10 to 20 percent cobbles and 5 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 4 or 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry.  It is clay loam or clay and averages 35 to 45 percent clay.  It has 15 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from serpentinitic rocks and peridotite.  The climate is characterized by cold moist to wet winters and hot dry summers.   The mean annual temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 40 to 70 inches but in areas of high winter rainfall may range to 120 inches.
