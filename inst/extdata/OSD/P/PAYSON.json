  "OVERVIEW": "The Payson series consists of somewhat poorly drained or moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived mainly from quartzite, shale, and limestone.  Payson soils are on low lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
