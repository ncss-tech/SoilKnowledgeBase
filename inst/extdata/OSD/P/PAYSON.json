These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks that are mainly quartzite, shale, and limestone.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 65 to 73 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 120 to 150 days."

Arave soils are fine-loamy.  Saltair soils are fine-silty, have salic horizons, and do not have natric horizons.  Terminal soils are loamy and shallow to duripans.  Warm Springs soils are fine-loamy, have mollic epipedons, and do not have natric horizons."
