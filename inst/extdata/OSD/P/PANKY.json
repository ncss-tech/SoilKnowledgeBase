They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist, and Quaternary loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 1 to 4 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,900 to 6,700 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."

Jaconita soils are sandy-skeletal, have calcic horizons, and occur on adjacent footslopes and backslopes of erosional fan remnants.  Khapo soils are coarse-loamy, have argillic and calcic horizons, and occur on adjacent toeslopes of erosional fan remnants.  Zozobra soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, have calcic horizons, and occur on shoulders of erosional fan remnants."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The classification of the Panky soil has changed from Fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Ustollic Haplargids.  The new classification better represents the properties of this soil which has been determined to have a fine-loamy, not fine, particle-size class.  This series has previously been correlated only in the Soil Survey of Santa Fe Area, New Mexico, in December 1970.  A new series type location has also been chosen because recent urban expansion destroyed the old one that was within an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.  New Mexico soil interpretation record (SIR) NM0099, represents the previous type location.  The SIR representing the type location of the new series concept is NM2400.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 3 inches. (AE horizon)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 3 to 17 inches. (Bt, Btk1, and Btk2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 36 to 53 inches. (Bk2 horizon)\nPaleargid great group - There is a clay increase of 15 percent or more (absolute) within one inch at the upper boundary of the argillic horizon. (AE and Bt horizons)\nNote:  This soil has minor amounts of volcanic glass in the coarse silt and very fine sand fractions.  It is assumed that most of the volcanic glass derived from nearby Pleistocene ash eruptions has altered to more stable minerals like chalcedony.  In addition, Lincoln lab data indicates that ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum and iron percentages are very low.  Panky soils thus do not have the properties of the andic intergrades.\nTaxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The new series type location has full characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S92NM-049-001.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
