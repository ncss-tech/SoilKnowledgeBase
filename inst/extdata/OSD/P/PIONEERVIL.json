  "OVERVIEW": "The Pioneervil series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in alluvium from igneous rocks. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent in intermontane basins, mountain valleys and canyons. The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
