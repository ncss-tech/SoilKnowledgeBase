The mean\nannual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  It is mildly\nalkaline to moderately alkaline.  The particle-size control\nsection has 10 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent\ncoarser than very fine sand.  The mollic epipedon thickness\nis 20 to 40 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and\nchroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bk1 horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry,\nand chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has weak medium and\ncoarse prismatic and weak fine to coarse subangular blocky\nstructure.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  It is calcareous throughout.\nThe Bk2 and Bk3 horizons, to a depth of 40 inches, have\nvalue of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3\nmoist and dry.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nBelow a depth of 40 inches the chroma ranges from 1 through\n3 and dark reddish brown mottles are typical.  The lower\npart contains thin lenses of volcanic ash in some pedons."
