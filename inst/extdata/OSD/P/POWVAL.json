  "OVERVIEW": "The Powval series consists of deep, well drained soils on\nstream terraces.  They formed in mixed alluvium with an\ninfluence of volcanic ash.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3\npercent.  The mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F,\nand the mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches.",

The mollic epipedon thickness\nis 20 to 40 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and\nchroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bk1 horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry,\nand chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has weak medium and\ncoarse prismatic and weak fine to coarse subangular blocky\nstructure.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  It is calcareous throughout.\nThe Bk2 and Bk3 horizons, to a depth of 40 inches, have\nvalue of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3\nmoist and dry.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nBelow a depth of 40 inches the chroma ranges from 1 through\n3 and dark reddish brown mottles are typical.  The lower\npart contains thin lenses of volcanic ash in some pedons."
