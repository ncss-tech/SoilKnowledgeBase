Elevations range from 1,490 to 2,135 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."

Puett soils are loamy, shallow to paralithic contacts, and do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons. Tulase soils are coarse-silty, very deep, and have horizons with durinodes, secondary carbonates and secondary gypsum."
