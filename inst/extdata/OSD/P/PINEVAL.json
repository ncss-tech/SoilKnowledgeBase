  "OVERVIEW": "The Pineval series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic or mixed rocks. Pineval soils are on fan remnants and fan aprons. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
