  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinoty series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice over lahar and alluvial sand and gravel.  These soils are on terraces at elevations of 1,000 to 1,500 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 120 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pinoty soils are on terraces at elevations of 1,000 to 1,500 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in layers of aerially deposited pumice and volcanic ash overlying lahar and alluvial sand and gravels.  Beginning at the surface of the mineral soil, the stratigraphy of pyroclastic material from Mt. St. Helens in a typical Pinoty soil profile is (1) fresh ash and pumice including the 176-year-old \"Layer T\", (2) pumice of the 400-year-old \"Layer W\", (3) ash, pumice, and scoria of the 2500-year-old \"B set\", (4) lahar material of gravelly alluvium.  The climate is characterized by warm, moist summers and cool, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 115 to 130 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 63 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
