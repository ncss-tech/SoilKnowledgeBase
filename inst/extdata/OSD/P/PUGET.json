    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Puget soils are on flood plains at elevations ranging from l0 to 650 feet. They formed in recent alluvium.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The soils are in a mild marine climate.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 55 inches, most of which falls as rain during the winter.  Snow is infrequent.   The average January temperature is about 38 degrees  F.; average July temperature is about 64 degrees F.; and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about l50 to l90 days."
