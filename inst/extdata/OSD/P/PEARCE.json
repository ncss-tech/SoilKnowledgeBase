  "OVERVIEW": "The Pearce series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from limestone.  Pearce soils are on mesas, hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 4 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Akela (NM), Beach (TX), Chatticup (NV), Dalvord (CA), Galehills (NV), Haleburu (NV), Hindu (AZ), Hulda (AZ), Noble Pass (CA), Paintrocks (CA), Razorback (AZ), Sutra (AZ), Tecopa (CA), Terlingua (TX) and Upspring (CA) soils.  Akela soils are usually dry from October through May.  Beach soils have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR.   Chatticup soils contain 60 to 89 percent rock fragments- with 25 to 40 percent in the 2 to 5 mm fraction and have formed from granite.  Dalvord do not have a required Bk horizon with visible accumulations of calcium carbonate and have formed in granite. Galehills soils are drier in the soil moisture control section due to a mean annual precipitation of 3 to 5 inches and formed in sandstone conglomerate. Haleburu soils are strongly alkaline in the lower part and formed in volcanic bedrock.  Hindu soils are moist for more than 20 cumulative days during July-September.  Hulda soils are dominantly coarse and very coarse in the sand fraction.  Noblepass soils are dry in the summer and formed in andesite and rhyolite.  Paintrocks soils are less than 3 inches deep to a paralithic contact and formend in granite.  Razorback have rock fragments that are dominated by cobble and stone and formed in extrusive igneous rock. Sutra soils have less than 60 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section and are dominated by gravel .  Terlingua soils are dry in the winter and formed from igneous rock. Tecopa and Upspring soils are usually dry from June through November, Tecopa soils formed in quartz and schist and Upspring soils formed in extrusive igneous rock."
