  "OVERVIEW": "The Ponycreek series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in siliceous sandy alluvium on stream terraces and pediments.  Permeability is rapid or very rapid.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The content of weatherable minerals (0.02 to 2 mm fraction) is less than 10 percent throughout.  Base saturation (by NH40Ac) is less than 50 percent throughout.  Volume of sandstone gravel or channers ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the solum and from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.  Redox accumulations are in the A horizon, or below the A horizon or both in some pedons.  Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are 50 percent or more of the matrix below the A horizon and within 20 inches.  Acquic conditions occur within a depth of 1 foot for long periods in most years.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR or is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or it is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sand or coarse sand.\nThe C or Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8 and chroma of 1 to 8.  It is sand or coarse sand.  In most pedons, the color is that of uncoated sand grains."

These soils formed in siliceous sandy alluvium.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 90 to 130 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1,400 feet."

The excessively drained Arbutus soils are nearby in some areas along major drainageways where the siliceous sand is underlain by igneous or metamorphic bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  The poorly drained Elm Lake soils and the somewhat poorly drained Fairchild soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where the siliceous sand is underlain by interbedded sandstone and shale at 20 to 40 inches.  The somewhat poorly drained Ironrun soils and the moderately well drained Rockdam soils form a drainage sequence with Ponycreek soils."
