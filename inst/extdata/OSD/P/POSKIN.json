  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon, thickness of the silty mantle, and depth to sandy outwash all range from 20 to 40 inches. The weighted average clay content of the argillic horizon ranges from 18 to 27 percent and the weighted average content of fine sand or coarser is less than 15 percent. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 40 percent in the loamy lower subsoil (transition zone).  Volume of gravel ranges from 3 to 45 percent as a weighted average in the sandy outwash, but ranges from 0 to 65 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the pedon except it ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Free carbonates are absent to depths of more than 5 feet.  Redoximorphic concentrations typically are throughout the pedon below the Ap or A horizon.  Redoximorphic depletions are in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon or higher. Saturation occurs in the upper 10 inches of the argillic at same time in most years.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Where the value moist is 3, the value dry is greater than 5.5.  Uncultivated pedons have A horizons, 1 to 5 inches thick, with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  The E horizon is silt loam or silt.\nPoskin soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.  Some pedons have a Btg horizon below the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon, with dominant chroma of 2.\nThe 2Bt transition horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nSome pedons have a 3Bt or 3Btg horizon (2Bt or 2Btg horizon in pedons without a loamy transition horizon between the silty mantle and outwash) with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand or the gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogs.\nThe 3C horizon (2C horizon in pedons without a loamy transition horizon between the silty mantle and outwash) has color like the 3Bt horizon described above.  It is typically stratified layers of sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs, but some individual strata may be extremely gravelly."

Blackriver and Ribriver soils are on higher landscape positions.  Maplehurst soils are on similar landscape positions.\nThe well drained Rosholt soils, moderately well drained Scoba and Scott Lake soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Oesterle soils are on nearby landscapes with Poskin soils where the silty mantle is thin or absent.  Rosholt, Scoba, and Scott Lake soils are on higher or more sloping landscape positions. Oesterle soils are on similar landscape positions."
