  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Purdam soils are on plug domes (buttes), lava flow lobes and troughs on lava plains and shield volcanoes and on dissected terraces in valleys.  Elevations are 2,000 to 5,000 feet.  Slopes are commonly less than 8 percent, but range up to 30 percent.  The soils formed in silty alluvium from loess and weathered volcanic ash over medium or moderately coarse-textured alluvium from igneous materials.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, including up to 2 feet of snow.  Average annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 100 to 160 days."

Sebree soils have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium in the Bt horizons.  Sluka and Vickery soils lack a Bt horizon.  These soils are on landscape positions similar to Purdam soils."

Crops are small grains, corn, sugar beets, alfalfa, potatoes, and onions; some is in pasture.  Vegetation in the potential natural plant community is Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Thurber needlegrass, and Sandberg bluegrass."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 10 inches (Ap horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 10 to 24 inches (Bt and Btkq horizons)\nCalcic horizon - the zone from 19 to 38 inches (Btkq and Bkqm horizons)\nDuripan - the zone from 24 to 38 inches (Bkqm horizon strongly cemented)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 24 inches\nSoil moisture regime - aridic bordering xeric\nThe classification of this pedon has been revised as of 4/00 from fine-silty, mixed, mesic Haploxerollic Durargids to fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Haploxeralfic Argidurids based on revisions to Soil Taxonomy.\nThe term silty alluvium used in this series concept infers a localized influence on the mixed loess and weathered ash mantle by overland flow of running water.\nGeographic setting - terms used throughout MLRA 11 to identify the setting of this soil are quire varied although all equate to the same landscape.  There will be further investigation from an MLRA project level as to the accepted terms for use.\nThe pedon description was revised 4/00 to agree with the original taxonomic unit description in the Canyon County Area, Idaho soil survey.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
