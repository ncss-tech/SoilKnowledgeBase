  "OVERVIEW": "The Purdam series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils on valleys and plains. They formed in silty alluvium from loess and weathered volcanic ash over medium or moderately coarse textured alluvium from igneous materials.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Elevations are 2,000 to 5,000 feet.  Slopes are commonly less than 8 percent, but range up to 30 percent.  The soils formed in silty alluvium from loess and weathered volcanic ash over medium or moderately coarse-textured alluvium from igneous materials.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, including up to 2 feet of snow.  Average annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 100 to 160 days."

There will be further investigation from an MLRA project level as to the accepted terms for use.\nThe pedon description was revised 4/00 to agree with the original taxonomic unit description in the Canyon County Area, Idaho soil survey."
