  "OVERVIEW": "The Portage series consists of very deep, very poorly and poorly drained soils that formed in acid clayey alluvium. Permeability is very slow.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches.",
