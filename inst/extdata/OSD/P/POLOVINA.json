  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Polovina series consists of deep, well-drained soils formed in medium textured material derived from pyroclastic deposits over gravelly residuum.  Polovina soils are on dipslopes and plains near volcanic cones.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 35 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",

A 1500 kPa water retention of between 12 and 15 percent on air-dried samples in 60 percent of the thickness between the mineral soil surface and 24 inches.  (Undried samples have not been examined for water retention at 1500 kPa).  In the mineralogy control section a sum of 8 times the silica plus 2 times the iron (percents by weight by acid oxalate) of 5 or more and 8 times the silica is more than 2 times the iron.  A lithic contact between 40 and 60 inches depth, a cryic temperature regime."
