Texture is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value moist of 2.5 or 3; chroma moist of 2 through 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly acid\nThe 2BC horizon has hue from 2.5Y to 10YR; value moist of 2.5 or 3; chroma moist of 2 or 3.

A 1500 kPa water retention of between 12 and 15 percent on air-dried samples in 60 percent of the thickness between the mineral soil surface and 24 inches.  (Undried samples have not been examined for water retention at 1500 kPa).  In the mineralogy control section a sum of 8 times the silica plus 2 times the iron (percents by weight by acid oxalate) of 5 or more and 8 times the silica is more than 2 times the iron.
