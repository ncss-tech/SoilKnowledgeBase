  "OVERVIEW": "The Papalote series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy and clayey alluvium of Pleistocene and Pliocene age. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on high terraces of inland dissected coastal plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).",

In fewer than 6 out of 10 years, this soil is saturated in the upper part of the Bt horizon for long duration. In some years, reduced conditions develop in the upper part of the argillic horizon for brief periods following extreme above-normal precipitation events (tropical storms). Redoximorphic features that result from these events are not diagnostic for classification."
