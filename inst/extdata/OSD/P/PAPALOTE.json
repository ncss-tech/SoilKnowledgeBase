    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Permeability is slow.  Runoff is low on 0 to 1 percent slopes, and medium on 1 to 5 percent slopes.  In fewer than 6 out of 10 years, this soil is saturated in the upper part of the Bt horizon for long duration. In some years, reduced conditions develop in the upper part of the argillic horizon for brief periods following extreme above-normal precipitation events (tropical storms). Redoximorphic features that result from these events are not diagnostic for classification."

Most areas are in native range and improved pasture with coastal bermudagrass being the dominant pasture grass.  Native grasses include little bluestem, feathery bluestem, Nash and hooded windmillgrass, and Texas and plains bristlegrass.  Woody species consist of live oak, post oak, mesquite, huisache, spiny hackberry, and pricklypear."
