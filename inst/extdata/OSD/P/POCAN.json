Eastable soils are very deep and are noncalcareous throughout. Ferdelford soils are calcareous throughout and are 60 to 100 cm deep over a paralithic contact.  Legler soils have a particle-size control section with silt loam or silty clay loam that is free of rock fragments.  North Powder soils have bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 cm.  Oxman soils are calcareous throughout and are 50 to 100 cm thick over paralithic contact to lacustrine sediments."

Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,375 to 1,925 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
