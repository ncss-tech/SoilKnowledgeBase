  "OVERVIEW": "The Pocan series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from quartzite, slate, shale, sandstone and chert.  Pocan soils are on side slopes of hills and mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Legler soils have a particle-size control section with silt loam or silty clay loam that is free of rock fragments.  North Powder soils have bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 cm.  Oxman soils are calcareous throughout and are 50 to 100 cm thick over paralithic contact to lacustrine sediments."
