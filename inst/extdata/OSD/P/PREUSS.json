  "OVERVIEW": "The Preuss series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum, slope alluvium and alluvium from calcareous siltstone on hills.  Permeability is moderate.  Preuss soils have slopes of 5 to 50 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches.  Average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
