  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Pekin soils are on treads and risers of stream terraces and on flood-plain steps. Slopes range from 0 to12 percent. Pekin soils formed in mixed silty alluvium and loess, with some pedons having loamy alluvium in the lower part of the series control section. The mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Frost free period ranges from 170 to 210 days."

The well drained Elkinsville soils do not have a fragipan and are on treads and risers. The poorly drained Peoga soils are on treads. The poorly drained Vincennes soils have a cambic horizon, and are on treads."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (1.41 to 14.11 micrometers/s) above the above fragipan and low to moderately high (0.07 to 1.41 micrometers/s) in the fragipan. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and slow or very slow in the fragipan. The potential for surface water runoff is medium to very high. Depth to an intermittent perched seasonal high water table is 0.46 to 0.6 meters (1.5 to 2 feet) in most years, except severely eroded phases are perched at 0.3 to 0.6 meters (1 to 2 feet). These soils on flood-plain steps are subject to rare flooding."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: In 1995 the classification of this series was changed from a Fragiudalf to a Fragiudult. In 1995 the type location was moved to represent a pedon with the base status of a Fragiudult. A severely eroded phase is recognized.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon: 0 to 23 cm or 0 to 9 inches (Ap horizon)\n2) Argillic horizon: 23 to 112 cm or 9 to 44 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Btx1, Btx2 horizons)\n3) Fragipan: 69 to 112 cm or 27 to 44 inches (Btx1, Btx2 horizons)\n4) Redoximorphic features: 38 to 152 cm or 15 to 60 inches (Bt2, Btx, C horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data available at Agricultural Experiment Station, Purdue University, Station Bulletin 222, file no. OR7708; Station Bulletin 323, file no.'s WS7904 (typical pedon), and JF7922; Station Bulletin 360, file no. LW7808; and Station Bulletin 451, file no.
