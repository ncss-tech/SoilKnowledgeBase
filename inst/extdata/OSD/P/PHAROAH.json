  "OVERVIEW": "The Pharoah series consists of very deep somewhat poorly drained soils that were formed in fine textured residuum, on the uplands in the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches).  Mean annual air temperature is about 16.1 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
