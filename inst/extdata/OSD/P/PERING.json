Sand content is less than 10 percent to 40 inches or more.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.  Uneroded pedons have an E horizon or BE horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. It may have masses of iron accumulation of differing hue with higher value and chroma and iron depletions of lower chroma. The Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 with masses of iron accumulation with different hue and higher chroma. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay with a clay maximum of 50 percent or more. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe BCg or Cg horizons have color similar to the Btg horizon.  They are silty clay loam or silt loam.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.  Some pedons have more than 10 percent sand at depths below 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pering soils typically are on convex slopes in the loess covered till plain. They are also on loess covered high stream terraces in some places. Slopes range from 2 to 14 percent. They formed in loess or loess and pedisediment. The mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 54 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 38 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Armstrong, Belinda, Gara and Rinda series. Armstrong soils are on lower landscape positions.  Belinda soils have an abrupt textural change and are on more level interfluves. Gara soils have more sand throughout and are on lower landscape positions.  Rinda soils have dominant chroma of 2 or less throughout the series control section and are on lower landscape positions."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Permeability is very slow. Runoff is medium. In undisturbed areas, a perched water table has an upper limit of 1.5 to 2.5 feet during November to May in most years.  USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in cultivated crops. Some areas are in pasture, hayland or woodland. Native vegetation is mixed grasses and trees."
