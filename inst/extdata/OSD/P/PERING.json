  "OVERVIEW": "The Pering series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on uplands and high stream terraces. Permeability is very slow. They formed in loess or loess and pedisediment. Slopes commonly are from 2 to 9 percent, but range to 14 percent. Mean annual temperature is 52 degrees F.,and mean annual precipitation is 36 inches.",
