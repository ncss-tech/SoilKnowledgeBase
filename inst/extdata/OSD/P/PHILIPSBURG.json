  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Philipsburg series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants, escarpments, hills, mountain slopes and landslides.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
