  "OVERVIEW": "The Princeton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in deposits of eolian silt and fine sand. The Princeton soils are on dunes and less commonly on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).",
