  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 25 to 50 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid, except for the surface layer, where limed. Coarse chert fragment ranges from none to 15 percent by volume in the A and Bw horizons and from 15 to 75 percent by volume in the C horizon. The thickness of the surface epipedon with value of 3 and chroma of 3 is less than 10 inches.\nThe Ap and A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and\nchroma of 3 through 8. Texture is dominantly silt loam or loam, but the range can include clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3\nto 6. Mottles in shades of yellow, brown, and gray range from\nnone to many. Texture of the fine earth fraction is dominantly silt loam, fine sandy loam, or loam, but the range can include sandy loam and silty clay loam."

The soil formed in alluvium washed from soils derived from limestone, shale, sandstone, and loess. Near the type location the mean annual temperature is 59.9 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is 55.6 inches."

Bodine, Sengtown, Humphreys, Minvale, and Mountview soils have argillic horizons. Dickson soils have a fragipan. Lobelville soils have redox depletions of chroma two or less within 24 inches of the surface."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was formerly mapped in the Ennis series. Ennis series has been reclassified and the range in characteristics requires a weighted average of 15 to 35 percent fragments in the 10 to 40 inch control section. When the OSD was updated in 2001 the lithological discontinuity was inadvertently left off of the C1 and C2 in the OSD description and range of characteristics.\nDiagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - from 0 to 9 inches (Ap horizon)\nCambic horizon - from 9 to about 38 inches (Bw horizons)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
