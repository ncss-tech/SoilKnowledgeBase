  "OVERVIEW": "The Perryville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Perryville soils are on alluvial fans and terraces and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F.",
