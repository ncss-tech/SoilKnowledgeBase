The soil formed in mixed alluvium from basalt, andesite, rhyolite, granite, limestone and quartzite.  The climate is arid and semiarid continental with mild winters and extremely hot summers.  Elevation ranges from 400 to 2500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 4 to 10 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 67 degrees to 74 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 250 to 350 days."

Cavelt soils have strongly cemented petrocalcic horizons at shallow depths.  Gilman and Glenbar soils do not have calcic horizons and have mixed mineralogy.\nMohall soils have moderately fine-textured argillic horizons.  Pinal soils have an indurated duripan at shallow depths.  Laveen, Gunsight, and Rillito are not carbonatic."
