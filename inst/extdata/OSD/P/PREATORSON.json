    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the very gravelly sand is 10 to 20 inches. Depth to the base of the solum is 10 to 20 inches. Some pedons have a very gravelly sandy loam B3ca horizon. The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature is 62 to 68 degrees F. Weighted average gypsum content is 0 to 5 percent. Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is slightly or moderately alkaline. The B2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It has moderate or strong medium or fine subangular blocky structure. It has 30 to 35 percent gravel and 5 to 20 percent cobbles. This horizon has 18 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 30 percent silt, 40 to 75 percent sand with more than 35 percent of the sand fraction being fine sand or coarser. Sand and silt fractions contain about 3 to 10 percent dark magnetic ferromagnesian rich minerals and basalt fragments. The Bt horizon is slightly or moderately alkaline. The C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR. It contains 50 to 75 percent gravel and 5 to 30 percent cobbles. The Bk horizon has less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

Slopes range from 0 to about 30 percent. These soils formed in thin, calcareous, sandy, gravelly, and cobbly alluvial materials derived principally from basalt. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 7 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer. Mean annual temperature is 45 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 69 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 110 to 140 days."
