    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Deanran, Dotsolot, Garnel, Lyra, and Poisoncreek series.\nDeanran, Garnel, Lyra, and Poisoncreek soils have paralithic contacts within 36 cm of the soil surface.  Dotsolot soils are dominated by fine pebbles (2 to 5 mm. diameter) of granitic lithology.  Epvip soils are intermittently moist during the summer due to convection storms and have 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pinenut soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as rhyolitic or andesitic tuff.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,925 to 2,445 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 65 to 80 days."
