  "OVERVIEW": "The Porvenir series consists of well drained soils shallow to sandstone bedrock that formed in some loess over residuum weathered from sandstone. Porvenir soils are on plateau margins with slopes of 0 to 10 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual soil temperature is 53 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock range from 10 to 20 inches (25 to 50 cm). The soils formed in some amount of moderately fine-textured, noncalcareous, eolian material over residuum weathered from sandstone. Rock fragments range from few to about 15 percent of which 60 percent is gravel. The solum is neutral or mildly alkaline. The control section ranges from sandy clay loam to clay loam and averages 18 to 35 percent clay. Carbonates are usually absent throughout the profile but can occur in the immediate area of the lithic contact.  Porvenir series is in a mesic soil temperature regime and an aridic-ustic soil moisture regime.\nA horizon:\nHue of 10YR to 7.5YR,\nValue of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist,\nChroma of 2 or 3.\nTexture of fine fraction: sandy clay loam, clay loam, loam, sandy loam, fine or very fine sandy loam\nFragments: 0 to 10 percent gravels, 0 to 15 percent cobbles\nBt1 horizon:\nHue of 10YR to 5YR\nValue of 4 through 5 dry, 3 moist\nChroma of 2 through 4\nTexture of fine fraction: clay loam, loam, sandy clay loam\nFragments: 0 to 30 percent gravels, 0 to 50 percent cobbles, 0 to 5 percent stones.\nBt2 horizon:\nHue of 10YR to 5YR\nValue of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist\nChroma of 2 through 4\nTexture: clay loam, loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam\nFragments: 0 to 30 percent gravels, 0 to 50 percent cobbles, 0 to 10 percent stones.\nSecondary Carbonates: 0 to 1 percent, when present, mostly hovering above the bedrock contact.\nR horizon: Indurated sandstone bedrock"
