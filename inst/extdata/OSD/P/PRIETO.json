The well drained Caguabo soils are on lower positions, are shallow to bedrock, and are loamy-skeletal.  Palm soils are on higher positions, are very deep, have clayey-skeletal control sections and are isothermic.  The well drained Sonadora soils have smectitic control sections.  The well drained Zarzal soils have more clay in the subsoil and are Oxisols."
