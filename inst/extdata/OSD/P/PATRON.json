  "OVERVIEW": "The Patron series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt and loess influenced by volcanic ash in the surface on hillslopes. Slopes are 5 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F. These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts for 70 to 100 days after the summer solstice. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches. The upper 7 to 14 inches has estimated bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 10 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half extractable iron of 0.4 to 0.7 percent, and 15 bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 40 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments by volume. Organic matter is estimated to range from 1 to 3 percent. Depth to secondary carbonates is 42 to more than 60 inches. There is an absolute increase in clay of 15 to 20 percent between the AB and 2Bt1 horizon.\nThe A and AB horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1, 2 or 3, dry or moist. It is ashy silt loam, ashy loam, gravelly ashy silt loam or cobbly ashy loam with 10 to 25 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. The upper part is clay loam, clay, gravelly clay, gravelly silty clay loam, or gravelly clay loam with 35 to 45 percent clay. The lower part is very gravelly clay loam, very cobbly clay and extremely gravelly clay with 35 to 50 percent clay. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a 2Btk horizons below 42 inches."
