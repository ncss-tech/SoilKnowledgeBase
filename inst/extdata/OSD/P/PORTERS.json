  "OVERVIEW": "The Porters series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on cool, north- to east-facing or shaded ridges and side slopes in the Southern Blue Ridge mountains, MLRA 130B.  These soils formed in residuum, affected by soil creep in the upper part, that has weathered from felsic to mafic, high-grade metamorphic and igneous rocks such as granite, gneiss, hornblende gneiss, mica gneiss, and amphibolite.  Near the type location, the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 52 inches.  Slope ranges from 2 to 95 percent.",

Crossnore and Jeffrey soils formed in residuum and Whiteoak in colluvium derived from low-grade metamorphic rock such as metasandstone and contain fragments of those rocks.  In addition, Crossnore soils have soft bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Jeffrey and Unaka soils have hard bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Porters soils have bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Tusquitee soils formed in colluvium and are greater than 72 inches to bedrock. Whiteoak soils have Bw horizons with clay content ranging from 18 to 29 percent."

Burton, Craggey, and Wayah soils are in a frigid family and are at higher elevations.  In addition, Burton is moderately deep and Craggey is shallow to bedrock. Cashiers soils are in a micaceous family and are in the same landscape position as Porters soils.  Chandler, Chestnut and Edneyville soils have lighter colored or thinner ochric epipedons and are on warmer and drier parts of the landscapes, typically on south to west aspects.  Chandler and Watauga soils are in a micaceous family.  Cowee, Evard, Saluda, and Watauga soils have an argillic horizon and are at locally lower elevations or on warmer slopes, typically south to west aspects. Cullasaja, Haywood, Saunook, Toecane, Tuckasegee, and Tusquitee soils formed in colluvium, are very deep, have C horizons of colluvial material, and are in coves and on toe slopes at locally lower elevations.  Plott soils are very deep to bedrock and have an umbric epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick. Trimont soils have an argillic horizon, are in a fine-loamy family, and are at locally lower elevations on cool aspect slopes.  Unaka soils are in the same landscape position as Porters soil."

On dry sites or the higher elevations upland oaks, hickory, blackgum, red maple, yellow birch, black birch, and pitch pine are associated.  Flowering dogwood, mountain laurel, and rhododendron are the dominant understory species.  Approximately 20 percent of the soil is cleared and used for pasture, hay, corn, truck crops, burley tobacco and Christmas trees."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Porters soils were formerly classified as Gray-Brown Podzolic soils intergrading to Lithosols.  The 9/89 revision restricts depth to bedrock to 40 to 60 inches.  The Plott series was previously included with Porters soils.  Plott soils are deeper than 60 inches to bedrock and have an umbric epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe 1/97 revision placed Porters soils in a fine-loamy family.  This series was formerly placed in a coarse-loamy family.  Laboratory PSA (pipette method) and corresponding field texture estimates (feel method) indicate control section clay contents of generally 12 to 24 percent, with most pedons marginally coarse-loamy.  However, chemical lab data indicate that sufficient amorphous, clay-sized materials occur in the particle-size control section to place this soil in a fine-loamy family.  Average clay contents are generally less than 25 percent.\nAdditionally, textures were also modified in the range in characteristics for horizons within the solum.\nThis latest revision places Porters soils in an isotic mineralogy class.  Using the 7th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy (1996), Porters soils would classify as fine-loamy, isotic, mesic Andic Dystrochrepts.  However, a proposal has been made to add an acid oxalate-extractable silicon requirement to Andic subgroups, which would exclude Balsam soils, which lack volcanic glass.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 7 inches (Ap horizon)\nUmbric Dystrochrept feature - Moist value of 3 in the 0 to 7 inch Ap horizon.\nCambic horizon - 10 to 28 inches (Bw and BC horizons)\nLithic contact - hard bedrock at a depth of 42 inches.\nIsotic mineralogy class - within the PSCS the soil generally has high amorphous materials (high pH-dependent charge) and a high moisture retention (at 1500 kPa) to clay ratio.\nProperties that would place the soil in an Andic subgroup--a horizon or horizons with total thickness of 7 inches (18 cm) or more within 30 inches (75 cm) of the mineral soil surface with a fine-earth bulk density of 1.0 g/cm3 or less (at 33 kPa water retention) and ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum plus 1/2 iron percentages totaling more than 1.0.\nRevised: 10/92-DLN,HJB,AG; 1/97-DHK, 12/97-DHK\n01-2011   Classification -- 11th Keys, update competing series, MLRA clarification --  BPS"
