  "OVERVIEW": "The Pilabo series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium.  These soils are on dipslopes of hogbacks, escarpments, hills, and cuestas and have slopes ranging from l5 to 35 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches.",

Pedons that meet the color, depth, and organic carbon content of a mollic epipedon are not moist 3 months or more of the year (cumulative) during the growing season.\nThe soil moisture regime should be reevaluated. Typic aridic soil moisture regime or Ustic aridic soil moisture regime? 8 to 10 inches of precipitation will not meet current paradigm established for MLRA 42 for soils in Ustic aridic moisture regime. This contradicts the current soil moisture and temperature regime paradigm utilized in MLRA 42. The 8 to 10 inches of annual precipitation is in a Typic aridic moisture regime.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nRevised for the correlation of White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; October, 2014, NMS\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
