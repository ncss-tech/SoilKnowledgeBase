    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 3 inches (A horizon).\nCambic horizon - the zone from 3 to 17 inches (Bw1, Bw2 horizons).\nClassification was changed from loamy-skeletal, mixed, thermic Aridic Haplustolls to loamy-skeletal, mixed, thermic, Ustic Haplocambids.  Pedons that meet the color, depth, and organic carbon content of a mollic epipedon are not moist 3 months or more of the year (cumulative) during the growing season.\nThe soil moisture regime should be reevaluated. Typic aridic soil moisture regime or Ustic aridic soil moisture regime? 8 to 10 inches of precipitation will not meet current paradigm established for MLRA 42 for soils in Ustic aridic moisture regime. This contradicts the current soil moisture and temperature regime paradigm utilized in MLRA 42. The 8 to 10 inches of annual precipitation is in a Typic aridic moisture regime.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nRevised for the correlation of White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; October, 2014, NMS\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
