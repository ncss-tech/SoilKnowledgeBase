The soil temperature is warmer than 47 degrees F from January 20 to December 1. The mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 65 degrees F. The A and Btn horizons have been mixed through cultivation in some pedons. In some pedons erosion has removed the entire A horizon. Organic matter is 1 percent or less and decreases with depth. Clay content in the Btn horizon is at least 1.2 times greater than that of the A horizon, except where the A horizon has been mixed with the Btn horizon or has been removed through erosion. Electrical conductivity is 0 to 16 decisiemens per meter. In some pedons, electrical conductivity has been significantly altered by human activities such as applications of soil amendments and irrigation water.\nThe A and E horizon have color of 10YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/1, 7/3, 7/4; or 2.5YR 6/2.

Clay content is 20 to 50 percent and averages 35 to 50 percent in the upper part. Sodium adsorption ratio is 13 to 80, although parts of some pedons that have been modified by agricultural practices have sodium adsorption ratio as low as 2. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 0 to 15 and is 2 to 15 in Btkn horizons. Effervescence of disseminated carbonates is none to strongly effervescent in Btn horizons. Disseminated and segregated carbonates are slightly effervescent to violently effervescent in Btkn horizons. Reaction is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.
