  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 20 to 32 inches.  The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid, except for the surface layers in areas that have been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Some pedons have a thin A1 horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon.  It has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6, or hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6; the lower part of the Bt horizon commonly has mottles in shades of brown or gray, and mottles with chroma of 2 or less, if present, are below 16 inches of the surface.  It is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  The particle-size control section, between a depth of 10 inches and the upper boundary of the fragipan, ranges from 5 to 18 percent clay, more than 15 percent fine and coarser sand, and from 35 to 60 percent silt.\nThe Btx horizon either has a matrix similar to the Bt horizon with mottles in shades of brown, red, or yellow, and in addition, has mottles with chroma of 2 or less; or it is mottled in shades of brown, yellow, red, and gray.  The fragipan has gray vertical seams that form a roughly polygonal pattern of prisms.  The matrix of the prisms is very firm when dry and brittle when moist, and in the major part of the Btx horizon, it constitutes as much as 60 percent of the volume or more.  The Btx horizon is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have few to common iron and manganese concretions."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cloudland and Stemley series in the same family and the closely related Benndale, Cane, Ora, Paden, Pheba, Sango, Savannah, and Stough series.  Cloudland soils have a thinner fragipan without red mottles in the lower part.  Stemley soils have chert fragments throughout with as much as 15 to 35 percent by volume above the fragipan.  Benndale soils do not have a fragipan.  Cane, Ora, and Savannah soils have a fine-loamy control section.  Paden soils have a fine-silty control section.  Pheba and Sango soils have a coarse-silty control section.  Stough soils have mottles with chroma of 2 or less in the upper part of the B horizon, and the lower part of the B horizon is brittle in less than 60 percent of the volume."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Prentiss soils are on marine and fluvial terraces of the Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The soils formed in loamy deposits of medium and moderately coarse texture.  The climate is warm and humid.  Mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees Fahrenheit and mean annual precipitation is about 53 inches near the type location."

Moderately well drained Ora and Savannah soils are either in similar or slightly higher positions than the Prentiss soils.  Somewhat poorly drained Stough soils are in slightly lower positions.  Somewhat poorly drained Longview soils, which are on nearby uplands, are silty and do not have a fragipan.  Poorly drained Mashulaville and Myatt soils are on broad flats and in depressions, and in addition, Mashulaville soils are dominantly gray in all horizons between the base of the A horizon and the fragipan, and Myatt soils are dominantly gray in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon.  Moderately well drained Quitman soils, which are in similar positions as the Prentiss soils, have a fine-loamy particle size class."
