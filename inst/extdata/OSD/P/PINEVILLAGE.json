  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinevillage series consists of very deep, well drained soils on alluvial fans and flood plains. They formed in gravelly and very gravelly loamy and sandy alluvium. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",

These soils are dominantly on high-lying alluvial fans. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Pinevillage soils formed in gravelly and very gravelly loamy and sandy alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 965 mm (35 to 38 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 11.1 degrees C (50 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days."

Both the excessively drained Rodman soils and the well drained Strawn soils are on adjacent terraces and upland side slopes. Rodman soils have less clay and Strawn soils have less rock fragments in the series control section. The somewhat poorly drained Tice soils are on lower lying flood plains."
