  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pinevillage soils are on alluvial fans, narrow flood plains, and structural benches below landforms thought to be of Wisconsinan age. These soils are dominantly on high-lying alluvial fans. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Pinevillage soils formed in gravelly and very gravelly loamy and sandy alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 965 mm (35 to 38 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 11.1 degrees C (50 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Rodman, Strawn, and Tice soils. Both the excessively drained Rodman soils and the well drained Strawn soils are on adjacent terraces and upland side slopes. Rodman soils have less clay and Strawn soils have less rock fragments in the series control section. The somewhat poorly drained Tice soils are on lower lying flood plains."
