Dunham soils average more than 15 percent gravel in the lower part of the series control section. Elvira soils have iron and manganese oxides in the B horizon and iron and manganese accumulations in the A horizon. Gillett Grove soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess and in the underlying glacial till. Hartsburg, Mascoutah, and Sable soils average less than 10 percent sand in the lower half of the series control section. Madelia and Marcus soils average less than 10 percent sand in the lower part of the B horizon, and the C horizon is not stratified in the series control section. Maxcreek and Rushmore soils have well graded sand fractions in the lower two parts of the series control section. Wacousta soils have the base of the cambic horizon within a depth of 76 cm (30 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pella soils are on nearly level or depressional areas on lake plains, outwash plains, and till plains thought to be of Wisconsin Age. They have plane or convex slopes with gradients typically less than 1 percent, but ranging from 0 to 3 percent. They formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loamy or silty material with less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand and the underlying stratified loamy sediments. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 12 degrees C (45 to 54 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 710 to 1041 mm (28 to 41 inches), frost-free period ranges from 140 to 195 days, and elevation ranges from 150 to 311 meters (492 to 1020 feet) above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Drummer soils and the Barrington, Brenton, Elburn, Harpster, Mundelein, Peotone, and Wauconda soils. Drummer soils are slightly higher on the landform and commonly are adjacent to or surround areas of Pella. The moderately well drained Barrington soils and somewhat poorly drained Mundelein soils are on higher parts of the landform and form a drainage sequence with Pella. The somewhat poorly drained Brenton and Elburn soils have argillic horizons, lack carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches), and are on higher part of the landform. Harpster soils are on similar or slightly lower parts of the landform and are calcareous throughout. Peotone soils are on similar or slightly lower positions, have mollic epipedons more than 61 cm (24 inches) thick, and lack carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Wauconda soils lack mollic epipedons and are on slightly higher parts of the landscape."

An apparent seasonal high water table is at 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 31 cm (1.0 foot) below the surface at some time during spring in most years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate."

A till substratum, bedrock substratum, stratified sandy substratum, and occasionally flooded phases are recognized. These phases will be evaluated during MLRA update activities to determine if new series are needed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 0 to 43 cm (0 to 17 inches) (Ap, A, and BA horizons): cambic horizon - the zone from approximately 43 to 97 cm (17 to 38 inches) (Btg1, Btg2 and 2Btg3).\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
