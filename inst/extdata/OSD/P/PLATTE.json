    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon-0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches)\nAquic conditions: 46 to 203 centimeters (18 to 80 inches) (2Cg horizon)\nSome areas of these soils may classify as Aquic Ustifluvents. These soils need additional water table studies to determine their proper placement in the classification system. Some poorly drained Platte soils may be included in the McCuligan series.\nSome pedons have finely disseminated carbonate in the A horizon as evidenced by strong effervescence. This could be related to microrelief in the landform and/or the fluctuations of the water table and capillary rise. This would make the carbonates secondary and should be investigated in the future.\n12/2011 TDW Changed the statement \"Slope is typically less than 1 percent, but ranges from 0 to 3 percent.\" to \"Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.\"\nChanged Depth to endosaturation from .5 to 1 meter (1 to 3 feet) to 46 to 91 centimeters (1.5 to 3 feet)\nAdded Rock fragments to the A horizon range in characteristics\nAdded Calcium carbonate equivalent to the A horizon range in characteristics\nChanged Rock fragments in the C horizon from Percent by volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent to 0 to 14 percent by volume; 2 to 20mm in size\nChanged Calcium carbonate equivalent in the C horizon from 0 to 10 percent to 0 to 3 percent\nChanged Rock fragments in the 2Cg horizon from percent by volume of gravel is typically 15 to 35 percent but ranges from 2 to 34, the upper part commonly contains less gravel than the lower part, stratification of the sandy and gravelly layers is common; to 2 to 34 percent by volume; 2 to 75mm in size, the upper part commonly contains less gravel than the lower part, stratification of the sandy and gravelly layers is common\nChanged Calcium carbonate equivalent in the C horizon from 0 to 5 percent to 0 to 3 percent\nUpdated the list of geographically associated soil series\nChanged Depth to seasonal high water table from 0.5 to 1 meter (1.0 to 3.0 feet) to 46 to 91 centimeters (1.5 to 3 feet)\nChanged Aquic conditions from 41 to 203 centimeters (16 to 80 inches) to 46 to 203 centimeters (18 to 80 inches)\nAdded Redoximorphic features to horizon range in characteristics\nRemoved Redoximorphic statement \"Redoximorphic features: common, fine and medium, yellowish brown to brown (10YR and 7.5 YR 4 to 5/4 to 6) iron masses or concentrations\" from range in characteristics\nRock fragments in the C horizon were changed from 0-5% to 0-14%\nDeleted poorly drained from the drainage class\nAdded clay content ranges to all horizon ranges\nAdded sand content ranges to all horizon ranges\nAdded MLRA's to the distribution and extent section\nMoved the soil temperature statement from geographic settings to the range in characteristics section\nChanged topographic quadrangle to USGS quadrangle in the type location section\nChanged the statement that Wann was on similar landform positions to Wann is on higher landform positions\nRemoved loam, silty clay loam, and silt loam from the A horizon range in characteristics\nRemoved loam from the C horizon range in characteristics\nChanged  the statement \"A small area is cultivated with crops..\" to \"A small percentage of areas are cultivated with crops..\"\nChanged range of chroma from 1 to 4 to 1 to 3.\nAdded the Ochric epipedon depths in remarks section\nRemoved \"Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: disseminated throughout the A horizon but absent in some pedons\"\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
