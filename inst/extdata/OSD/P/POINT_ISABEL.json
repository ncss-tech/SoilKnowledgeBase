  "OVERVIEW": "The Point Isabel series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy and clayey eolian deposits.  These soils are on vegetated dunes.  Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 23 degrees C (73.5 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).",
