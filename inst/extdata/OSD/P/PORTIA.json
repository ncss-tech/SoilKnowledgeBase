  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Gallia soils are in the same family and soils with common limits in definition are Britwater, Holstein, and Negley series.  Gallia soils have a higher content of sand and gravel in the lower solum and substratum.  Britwater and Negley soils have mixed mineralogy.  In addition, Britwater soils have over 15 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Holstein soils have more sand in the lower part of the solum."

These soils formed in residuum from sandstone, siltstone, and limestone bedrock.  Average annual temperature is about 52 degrees to 57 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is about 40 to 50 inches."

Moko soils on higher sideslopes have profiles with less than 20 inches to bedrock.  Noark soils on slightly higher sideslopes have a clayey-skeletal control section."
