    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a paralithic contact with weathered granite ranges from 20 to 40 inches. This soil is usually moist and is dry for 30 to 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments. Mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F. The ashy silt loam or ashy loam, loess and volcanic ash, mantle is 7 to 14 inches thick. The volcanic ash mantle is estimated to have a moist bulk density of less than 1.0 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 4.0 percent and volcanic glass content of 60 to 90 percent. Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid throughout.\nThe A and Bw horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, values of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist. Some pedons do not have rock fragments on the surface and some are stony.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry. Texture is gravelly sandy loam, gravelly coarse sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam, or very gravelly coarse sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist, 5 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 or 5 moist and dry. It is very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly coarse sandy loam, very cobbly sandy loam, extremely stony sandy loam, or very cobbly coarse sandy loam."
