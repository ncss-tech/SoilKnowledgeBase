  "OVERVIEW": "The Pond series is a member of a fine-loamy, mixed, thermic family of Mollic Haplargids (the classification is tentative-see remarks).  The soils have light gray to light brownish gray, slightly hard, clay loam A1 horizons, very pale brown sandy clay loam Bt horizons and very pale brown sandy loam C horizons.  The soils are calcareous throughout and developed on granitic alluvium.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils have ochric epipedons with values of 4 or less, moist; an argillic horizon which has >15 percent ESP.  The solum ranges from 16 to 56 inches inches in thickness.  The soils are usually dry and the mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 72 degrees F.  Soil mineralogy is mixed.\nThe A horizons range in texture from fine sandy loam to loam and clay loam; in color from light gray and light brownish gray in hues of 10YR and 2.5Y with values of 5 to 7, chromas of 1 to 3; reaction from moderately to strongly alkaline and calcareous.  There are areas in which the upper A, for a thickness up to 4 inches, may be light gray, massive, and noncalcareous.\nThe B2t horizon ranges in color from light gray, light brownish gray, very pale brown, grayish brown, in 10YR and 2.5Y hues with values of 4 to 7, chromas of 2 to 4; in texture from clay loam, sandy clay loam, to silty clay loam; in reaction from strongly to very strongly alkaline and moderately to strongly calcareous; in structure from massive to angular blocky.\nThe C horizons range in texture from sandy loam to loam and they may have thin weakly lime or silica cemented pans or plates which are not continuous.  They are moderately to strongly alkaline and calcareous to noncalcareous."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Pond soils occur on nearly level to undulating alluvial fans formed from alluvium from granitic rock.  They occur at elevations of 40 to 2,600 feet, in an arid and semiarid mesothermal climate with mean annual rainfall of 1 to 8 inches, with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 58 to 63 degrees F., average January temperature about 45 degrees F., and average July temperature about 80 degrees F.  Frost-free season averages about 230 - 260 days."
