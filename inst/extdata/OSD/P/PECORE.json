    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (Unless otherwise stated, depth is measured from the top of the mineral soil.) Thickness of the loamy mantle and depth to sandy outwash range from 40 to 60 inches. The weighted average clay content ranges from 18 to 30 percent and the weighted average content of fine sand or coarser ranges from 20 to 50 percent in the particle-size control section. Volume of gravel ranges from 2 to 15 percent in the loamy mantle and from 0 to 35 percent as a weighted average in the sandy outwash. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part of the loamy mantle and strongly acid to neutral in the lower part. Reaction in the sandy outwash is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe O horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is a mat of highly decomposed forest litter.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nPecore soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both). The E part has color and texture like the E' horizon above. The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Typically, it is silt loam, loam or clay loam but in some pedons it is sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above. Some pedons have thin strata of Bt material in the upper part of the sandy outwash.\nSome pedons have a thin 2Bt horizon with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sand, loamy sand, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is stratified sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly analogs."
