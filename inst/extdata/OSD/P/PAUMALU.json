Alaeloa soils have 2.5YR or redder hue, strong structure in the argillic horizon, and thick continuous clay films in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Kalapa soils have clay texture and moderately thick clay films in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Pauwela soils have high bulk density and 10YR or 2.5YR hue in the A horizon and moderately thick clay films in the argillic horizon."
