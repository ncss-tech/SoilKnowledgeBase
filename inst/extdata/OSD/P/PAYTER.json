  "OVERVIEW": "The Payter series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from sandstone.  Payter soils are on alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
