  "OVERVIEW": "The Popash series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, slowly or very slowly permeable soils in depressional areas in the Lower Coastal Plain.  They formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

Soil reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the A and Eg horizons and from moderately acid to neutral in the Btg horizon.  The base saturation is more than 35 percent at depths of 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon.\nSome areas have a layer of muck less than 3 inches thick on the surface.  Where present, it has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is muck.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or less.  Texture is mucky fine sand, mucky sand, mucky loamy sand, fine sand, sand, or loamy sand.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less.  Redoximorphic accumulations in shades of brown or yellow range from none to common.  Some pedons have thin tongues of material in shades of gray to black extending from the A horizon in shades of gray to black.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, or gray range from none to common.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam."

Malabar soils are on similar positions but have cambic horizons above the argillic horizon.  The poorly drained Lokosee soils are on slightly higher positions."

The poorly and very poorly drained Felda soils are on similar positions and have sandy surface and subsurface horizons 20 to 40 inches in thickness.  Floridana and Manatee soils are Mollisols and are on similar positions.  In addition, Floridana soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers of 20 to 40 inches in thickness and Manatee soils have coarse-loamy control sections.  Placid and Pompano soils are on similar to lower positions and are sandy throughout.  In addition, Placid soils have umbric epipedons.  The poorly or very poorly drained Wabasso soils are on similar to higher positions and have spodic horizons."

Soil samples from the lab showed the base saturation to be less than 50 percent in the surface layer.\nThe water table is above the surface for more than 6 months in most years.  It is within 12 inches of the surface for most of the remainder of the year.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
