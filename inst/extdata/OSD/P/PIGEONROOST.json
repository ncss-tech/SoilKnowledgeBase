    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Clymer, Edgemont, Edneytown, Gladstone, Joanna, Millstone, Pennval (T), Shelocta, Syenite, and Wist (T) series. There are approximately 42 closely related series in different CEC classes or with no CEC class currently assigned. Clymer soils are deep to a lithic contact of sandstone. siltstone, or shale. Edgemont soils formed in residuum weathered from quartzitic rocks and contain fragments of those rocks. Edneytown soils are very deep. Gladstone soils have 5YR color in the Bt and are found in the Highlands sections of New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Joanna soils have redder hues throughout the solum and formed in Triassic materials. Millstone soils formed in alluvium on stream terraces of the Ohio River and have thicker argillic horizons. Pennval and Shelocta soils formed in colluvium from shale, siltstone, and sandstone. Syenite soils have a lithologic discontinuity of loess over residuum. Wist soils formed from fluvial marine sediments containing glauconite on the Northern Coastal Plain."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pigeonroost soils are on strongly sloping to very steep ridges and side slopes of low and intermediate mountains in the Blue Ridge (MLRA 130).. Slopes are typically between 30 and  50  percent but range from 5 to 95 percent. Elevation ranges from about 1,200 to 4,500 feet. Pigeonroost soils formed in residuum affected by soil creep in the upper part and weathered from felsic to mafic high-grade metamorphic or igneous rocks such as granodioritic gneiss and hornblende gneiss. The mean annual temperature ranges from about 46 to 57 degrees F., the frost free season ranges from about 100 to 150 days, and the average annual rainfall ranges from about 45 to 64 inches."

Evard and Cowee soils are 5YR or redder. Clifton soils have a fine particle size class. Ashe, Chestnut, Cleveland, Edneyville, Plott, Porters, and Unaka soils do not have an argillic horizon. Peaks soils are in a loamy-skeletal particle size family. Saluda soils have a paralithic contact with weathered bedrock at  less than 20 inches. Rabun soils have argillic horizon with value 3 or less and are in a fine particle-size class. Saunook, Trimont, Thunder, Toecane, and Tusquitee soils have thick surface horizons with Humic features. Huntdale, Plott, Porters, and Unaka have umbric epipedons. All these soils formed on ridges and side slopes except Saunook, Thunder, Toecane, and Tusquitee soils which are on colluvial benches, toe slopes, and fans. Also, Huntdale, Plott, Porters, Trimont, and Unaka soils are on cooler ridges and side slopes on north to east aspects."

Common trees are chestnut oak, white oak, scarlet oak, black oak, hickory, red maple, yellow poplar, eastern white pine, and Virginia pine. Cleared areas are used for pasture, hayland, and occasionally ornamental crops and orchards."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Soils now included with the Pigeonroost series were previously mapped with Cowee or Edneytown soils. Cowee soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the subsoil, and Edneytown soils are very deep to bedrock. The clay content of the particle-size control section for Pigeonroost soils averages about 18 percent. The total silt content ranges from about 30 to 50 percent. The fine silt fraction averages about 35 percent and ranges from about 20 to 40 percent. According to engineering index data, a large portion of the silt content is very fine silt.\nThe 12/97 revision places the Pigeonroost series in the fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludults family per the 7th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy (1996). The CEC activity class placement is based on sample pedons S90-NC-121-006 and S91-NC-171-002 and placement of similar soils such as Edneytown. Sample pedon S91-NC-171-002 classifies as semiactive, but the active class is consistent with similar series. Horizon depths and runoff class were also revised at this time.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 5 inches (Oe and A horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 5 to 28 inches (Bt horizon)\nParalithic contact - weathered bedrock contact at 39 inches (upper boundary of the Cr horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE; pedon number S90NC-121-006 and S91NC-171-002 (sampled as Chestnut).\nMLRA: 130 SIR(s): NC0247\nRevised: 4/94-JBA-RHR-JAK; 1/98-DHK; 2/02-MKC\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
