  "OVERVIEW": "The Paquin series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits on lake plains, outwash plains, ground moraines, bars, low dunes and beach ridges. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid through the ortstein layers, and rapid in the remainder of the profile.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon.\nSome pedons have an A horizon that has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or is neutral, value of 2 to 4, and a chroma of 0 to 2.\nThe E horizon has a hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2. Texture of the A and E horizons is sand or fine sand. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bhs and Bhsm horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture of the Bhsm and Bhs horizons is sand or fine sand. Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bsm horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.
