Depth to the ortstein ranges from 10 to 16 inches, and the ortstein thickness ranges from 10 to 15 inches.  Depth to redoximorphic features ranges from 30 to 40 inches. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon.\nSome pedons have an A horizon that has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or is neutral, value of 2 to 4, and a chroma of 0 to 2.\nThe E horizon has a hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2. Texture of the A and E horizons is sand or fine sand. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bhs and Bhsm horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture of the Bhsm and Bhs horizons is sand or fine sand. Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bsm horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture of the Bsm is sand or fine sand. Reaction of the Bsm horizon is extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is sand or fine sand. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4. It is sand or fine sand.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Borgstrom and Wallace series.  The closely related Pullup and Voelker soils will compete when their family is changed to shallow, ortstein.  The Pullup, Voelker and Wallace soils have representative wet soil moisture status below 80 inches.  The Borgstrom soils have stratified textures in the substratum with more than 15 percent combined content of silt and clay."

The poorly drained Spot and very poorly drained Leafriver soils are in depressions and drainageways. The Wallace soils are well drained and occupy slightly higher landscape positions.  The Wallace, Finch and Spot soils form a drainage sequence with the Paquin series."

These soils have representative wet soil moisture status from 24 to 42 inches below the surface during the months of March, April, May, June, October, and November.  Surface runoff is negligible to low, dependent on slope.  Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid through the ortstein layers and rapid in the remainder of the profile."
