These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Elevations are 4600 to 5000 feet.  The mean annual air temperature is 52 to 55 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches.  The frost-free period is 135 to 175 days."

Curhollow soils do not have argillic horizons and have a shallow petrocalcic horizon that overlies bedrock.  Rolie soils do not have argillic horizons and contain less that 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Winona soils do not have a petrocalcic horizon."
