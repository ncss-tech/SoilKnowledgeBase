  "OVERVIEW": "The Plaintank series consists of shallow to hardpan, well drained soils on fan terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Slope is 1 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
