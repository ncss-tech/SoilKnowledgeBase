These soils formed on structural benches and plateaus of limestone residuum covered by tephra deposits. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches (254 to 356 millimeters) and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains and snowfall during December and January. The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 54 degrees Fahrenheit (10.0 to 12.2 degrees Celsius). The frost-free period is 135 to 165 days."

Chedeski soils have a substantial sedimentary residuum layer, and a particle size control section having less than 35 percent sedimentary rock fragments. Flaco soils have calcic and argillic horizons, and are moderately deep from terrace deposits.  Factory soils have a petrocalcic horizon, and are moderately deep from terrace deposits. Meriwhitica soils do not have tephra, and form on cliffs and canyons."
