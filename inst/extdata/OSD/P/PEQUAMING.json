  "STATES": "MI,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pequaming series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy till on moraines and till plains.  These soils have moderately rapid and rapid permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 46 inches.  The solum ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.  The C horizon is strongly acid to slightly acid.  The solum contains up to 10 percent of gravel and cobbles. The C horizon contains up to 25 percent gravel and cobbles.  Stony surface phses are also recognized.\nUncultivated areas have a black (5YR 2/1) or very dark gray (5YR 3/1) A horizon, 1 to 4 inches thick. In some areas the A horizon is absent and the E horizon is directly below a layer of forest duff.  The E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3.  The Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together in this horizon.\nThe E' horizon has of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sand or loamy sand.  This horizon often exhibits weak platy structure that is slightly hard when dry, but does not qualify as a fragipan.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 5. It is loamy sand or sandy loam. Some pedons have E/B or B/E horizons with colors and textures similar to the E' and Bt horizons.  Some pedons with E/B or B/E horizons do not have Bt horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is dominantly loamy sand and ranges to gravelly sandy loam or sandy loam. Some contain strata or pockets of sand."
