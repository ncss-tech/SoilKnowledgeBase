  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Total clay in the 10- to 40- inch control section ranges from 25 to 40 percent, and silicate clay ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent of the 10- to 40- inch\ncontrol section averages from 10 to 25 percent.  The calcic\nhorizon occurs at depths of 10 to 39 inches and has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 5 to 15 percent more than the C horizon.  Coarse fragments comprise 0 to about 10 percent by volume and may\nbe concentrated in individual horizons.  Electrical conductivity\nis 0 to 2 mmhos/cm at 25 degrees C. in the upper 30 inches and\nranges from 2 to 16 mmhos/cm below 30 inches.  The exchangeable sodium percentage is 0 to 10 percent in the upper 30 inches and increases with depth.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown (10YR 5/2), pale brown (10YR 6/3), brown (10YR 5/3), or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2).  Texture is\nclay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.  Moist values are greater\nthan 3.5.\nThe B horizons are pale brown, light yellowish brown, yellowish brown, brown, or very pale brown in hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is clay loam or silty\nclay loam with 20 to 35 percent silicate clay.\nThe C horizons are very pale brown, light yellowish brown, pale brown, pink, or pale yellow in hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value\nof 6 or 7, and chroma of 3 to 4.  Crystalline gypsum and other\nsalts range from 1 to 15 percent by volume.  It is clay loam,\nsilty clay loam, or loam."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same\nfamily.  Series in similar families are Aguilares, Coahuila,\nCopita, Garceno, Moglia, and Pryor.  Aguilares soils have more\nsand coarser than very fine sand.  Coahuila soils have more than\n40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the control section.  Copita soils have more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand, and also have sandstone at 20 to 40 inches.  Garceno and\nPryor soils have more than 35 percent silicate clay in the control section, and Garceno soils also lack a calcic horizon.  Moglia\nsoils are more saline and have a different plant community."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Palafox soils occur on nearly level uplands\nof the Western Rio Grande Plain.  Surfaces are plain to convex.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent but are typically less than 2 percent.  They formed in calcareous sediments of the Tertiary age.  The average annual precipitation range is 16 to 20 inches and the Thornthwaite P-E index range is 23 to 26.  The mean annual air temperature range is 71 to 74 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include Brundage,\nCatarina, Jimenez, Maverick, and Quemado series and Copita of the competing series.  Brundage soils have fine-loamy control sections and are at lower elevations parallel to drainageways.  Catarina\nsoils have intersecting slickensides and are on broad, nearly\nlevel to gently sloping valleys at lower elevations.  Copita soils are on higher or lower elevations adjacent to the Palafox soils.  Jimenez and Quemado soils have loamy-skeletal control sections and are on small hills or ridges at higher elevations.  Maverick soils are more clayey and are at lower elevations on the more sloping erosional surfaces."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used primarily for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Some of the larger areas would be suitable for irrigated cropland if irrigation water was available.  The native vegetation in excellent condition is composed of 90 percent\ngrasses, 5 percent woody plants, and 5 percent forbs.  In\nexcellent condition mid grasses dominate.  Blackbrush, mesquite,\nand lotebush are dominant woody plants.  The major forbs are\nvelvet bundleflower, orange zexmenia, and bushsunflower.  As retrogression occurs, woody plants, especially blackbrush, and mesquite increase in density.  Grasses which increase or invade,\nare red grama, Hall's panicum, threeawn, and Texas bristlegrass."
