  "OVERVIEW": "The Pentz series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or residuum derived from basic tuff. Pentz soils are on hills with mound and swale microrelief, and on backslopes of hills. These soils are on the mound position. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 440 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C.",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pentz soils are on mound positions on hillslopes with mound and swalemicrorelief. The microrelief is most strongly expressed on slopes of less than 20 percent. Pentz soils are also found on steep backslope positions on hillslopes and lahars. Slopes are convex or linear and are 2 to 60 percent. Elevation is 30 to 660 meters. The soils formed in colluvium or residuum derived from basic tuff (andesitic) primarily associated with the Mehrten formation. The grain size distribution of these volcaniclastic rocks is dominantly sand sized, but there can layers with conglomerate or andesitic coarse fragments in some areas. More strongly consolidated strata may outcrop as bands across a hill slope. Coarse fragments in the soil are commonly a lag deposit from remnant Pleistocene stream terraces associated with the overlying Arroyo Seco or China Hat formations. The climate is Mediterranean with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 350 to 870 mm. Mean annual temperature is 15 to 17 degrees C; average January temperature is about 8 degrees C; and average July temperature is about 25 to 27 degrees C. Frost-free period is 235 to 350 days."

Hadselville soils are in swales between mounds, are less than 25 cm to a paralithic contact, and lack a cambic horizon. Jennylind and Ospital soils are on erosion remnants and have a lithic contact within 50 cm. Keyes soils are on fans, stream terraces and hills, have an argillic horizon, and a duripan within 50 cm. Pardee soils are on dissected fan remnants, have an argillic horizon, and have greater than 35 percent fragments in the particle-size control section. Peters are on swale positions on hills with mound and swale topograph and have greater than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Redding soils are on dissected fan remnants, have an argillic horizon, and a duripan between 50 to 100 cm."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Pentz series was formerly classified as medial, thermic, shallow Typic Vitrandepts. Although these soils are formed in material that is weathered from tuffaceous sediments, the ash influence is very minor. The type location was moved from Merced County to Sacramento County, California. Pentz clay (adobe) as mapped in the Chico and Lodi Areas, California, conforms to the subsequently established Peters series. Soils mapped as Pentz in Shasta County Area and those mapped on slopes of greater than 50 percent in Eastern Stanislaus County Area need further study to determine if the contact is lithic or paralithic. In addition, those mapped in Shasta County Area are underlain by tuff and may have a stronger ash influence. Some or all of the soils mapped as Pentz in the Amador Area, California are formed in material weathered from acidic tuff and would not be identified as the Pentz series today.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 23 cm (A1 and A2 horizon)\nCambic horizon: 23 to 41 cm (Bw and Bt horizon)\nParalithic contact: 39 cm (Cr horizon)\nParticle Size Control Section for this pedon: 25 to 39 cm."
