  "OVERVIEW": "The Passion series consists of shallow to soft bedrock, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from fanglomerate or sandstone. The Passion soils are on hills. Slopes range from 20 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches (432 millimeters) and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F (16 degrees C).",
