    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the gravelly 2C horizon ranges from 14 to 23 inches.  Depth to perched water table during the growing season ranges from 10 to 25 inches.  The solum ranges in thickness from 14 to 26 inches and contains buried horizons.  The upper part of the control section formed in loess dominated by amorphous material.  Reaction in the solum ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid and from moderately acid to slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe A and Ab horizons have moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, moist value of 2 or 3 and moist chroma from 1 through 3.\nThe Bw and Bwb horizons have moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, moist value of 3 or 4 and moist chroma of 3 or 4.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 5 percent cobble and 0 to 5 percent gravel.\nThe 2Bw and 2BC horizons, when present, have moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, moist value of 3 or 4 and moist chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is sandy loam or loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent cobble and 5 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe 2C horizons have moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, moist value of 3 or 4 and moist chroma of 3 or 4.  Textures is sandy loam or loam.  Coarse fragment content exceeds 35 percent with 15 to 40 percent gravel and 10 to 30 percent cobble."

The soils formed in loess, mixed with volcanic ash, over firm, very gravelly or cobbly glacial till.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 33 to 36 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 50 inches."
