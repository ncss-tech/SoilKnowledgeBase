Akela, Beach, Dalvord, Haleburu, Hindu, Hulda, Pearce, Razorback, Tecopa, Terlingua and Upspring series are all greater than 4 inches to a paralithic or lithic contact. In addition, Akela soils form in calcareous material from basaltic alluvium and rhyolitic tuff and the moisture control section is moist in some part for more than 20 days cumulative between June and September; Beach soils form from fine grained metamorphic sandstone and have an A horizon with hues of 2.5YR or 5YR and receive most of their precipitation during the summer months; Haleburu soils formed from volcanic sources and have finer textures; Hindu soils form from limestone or calcareous sedimentary rocks, have a control section dominated by cobbles, and a moisture control section that is moist in some part for more than 20 days cumulative between June and September; Hulda soils are in the 8 to 10 inch precipitation zone; Pearce soils are in the 8 to 12 inch precipitation zone, have finer textures and have calcium carbonate equivalents of 5 to 35 percent; Razorback soils are in the 6 to 12 inch precipitation zone, formed from extrusive igneous rocks and have finer textures; Tecopa soils form from mixed metamorphic and igneous rocks such as schist, gneiss, and quartzite, have a thicker epipedon, contain a larger proportion of medium and finer sands, and are dry during the summer months; Terlingua soils have horizons with accumulations of secondary calcium carbonate and formed in volcanic rock; and Upspring soils form from basic igneous rocks with some pyroclastic material, have a control section that ranges from very gravelly to very stony, and are dry in the moisture control section during the summer."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Paintrocks soils are on mountains, hills, and pediments. Slope ranges from 2 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in material from granitic sources.  Elevations are from 2,400 to 5,700 feet. The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and cool winters. Most precipitation comes in the winter but in some areas it is sporadic. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 8 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 69 degrees F. Mean July temperature is about 78 degrees F., and mean January temperature is about 42 degrees F. The frost-free season is 200 to 340 days."
