It is loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  Field estimated and measured clay range from 7 to 10 percent and are less than 2.5 times 15 bar water values.  This horizon has up to 15 percent durinodes.\nThe duripan ranges from 4 to more than 30 inches in thickness and has an indurated opal cap of 1 to 2 mm. thickness and vertical coatings of opal."
