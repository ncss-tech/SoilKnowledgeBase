  "OVERVIEW": "The Poe series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in sediments weathered from tuff, basalt, diatomite, and ash.  Poe soils are on terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
