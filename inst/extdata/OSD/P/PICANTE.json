Depth to soft bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  The soil is typically calcareous throughout, but some pedons may be leached a few inches.  The particle-size control section is clay loam, silty clay loam, or loam, and has 18 to 35 percent clay and has more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  The moisture control section is dry for 15 consecutive days from May 15 to July 15, when the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.  (5 degrees C.).  It is not dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice to October 20, and for at least 90 cumulative days during that period.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The A horizon has 0 to 20 percent gravel and/or cobble.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 6.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Dulce, Kinusta, and Tassel soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.\nEpping soils have many siltstone chips and contain a significant amount of glass shards.\nEslendo soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section most of the time after April 15 to July 1.\nFairburn soils have less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand in the particle-size control section.\nKlondike and Redarrow soils have hue of 5YR or redder.\nShingle soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section between May 15 and July 15, and are in a climatic setting that receives about 3/4 of the annual precipitation during the months of April through September, and the PE Index is 19 to 30.\nSpearfish soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder, occur at lower elevations, and have less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nSandoval soils have a mean annual soil temperature greater than 53 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Picante soils are on cuestas and hills at elevations of 5,800 to 6,800 feet.  These soils formed in residuum from interbedded siltstone and shale.  Slopes are 5 to 45 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 to 15 inches.  It is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year with May and June being the driest months.  Average annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F., and average summer air temperature ranges from 64 to 70 degrees F.  The PE Index is about 40 at the type location and ranges from 35 to 50 for the series."
