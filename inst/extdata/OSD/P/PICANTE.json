  "OVERVIEW": "The Picante series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from interbedded siltstone and shale.  These soils are on cuestas and hills.  Slope is 5 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 53 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 63 to 69 degrees F.  Depth to soft bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  The soil is typically calcareous throughout, but some pedons may be leached a few inches.  The particle-size control section is clay loam, silty clay loam, or loam, and has 18 to 35 percent clay and has more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  The moisture control section is dry for 15 consecutive days from May 15 to July 15, when the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.  (5 degrees C.).  It is not dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice to October 20, and for at least 90 cumulative days during that period.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The A horizon has 0 to 20 percent gravel and/or cobble.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 6.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
