  "OVERVIEW": "The Panton series consist of very deep, poorly and somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous glaciolacustrine and estuarine clays on glacial lake plains.  Permeability is very slow.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 36 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

The Albano, Bergland, Canadice, Concord, Condit, Covington, Indus, Kanona, Kinsbury, Latty, Munson, Paulding, Roselms, Scantic, Trumbull, Watchung, Weir and Wetzel series are similar soils in related families.  Albano have mixed mineralogy.  Bergland, Kanona, Latty, Munson, Paulding, and Scantic soils do not have argillic horizons.  Canadice, Concord, Condit, Trumbull, Watchung, Weir, and Wetzel soils have less than 60 percent clay in the solum.  Covington soils have Mollic epipedons.  Indus soils have smectitic mineralogy.  Kingsbury and Roselms soils have chroma of 3 or more in some subhorizons above 30 inches."

They are on broad plains and in depressions and drainageways and on sideslopes of swells and knolls.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in calcareous glaciolacustrine or estuarine clays associated with the end of the Wisconsin glaciation.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 36 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F.  The growing season ranges from 135 to 165 days."
