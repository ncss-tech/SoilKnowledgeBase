    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 46 inches.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 60 inches.  Depth to contrasting strata or bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Rock fragments are usually absent.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the surface and subsurface layers, from strongly acid to mildly alkaline in the subsoil, and from neutral to moderately alkaline in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Structure is moderate or strong, very fine to coarse granular or moderate or strong, very fine to medium angular or subangular blocky.  Consistence is very friable, friable, or firm.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Structure is moderate or strong, very fine to coarse granular or moderate or strong, very fine to medium angular or subangular blocky.  Consistence is very friable, friable, or firm.  Some pedons do not have an Eg horizon.\nThe Btg horizon is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is clay.  Structure is weak to strong, thin to thick, platy or coarse or very coarse prismatic parting to weak to strong, fine to coarse angular or subangular blocky.  Consistence is firm, very firm, extremely firm, sticky, very sticky, plastic, or very plastic.\nThe Cg horizon is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:   There are currently no other series in the same family.  The Albano, Bergland, Canadice, Concord, Condit, Covington, Indus, Kanona, Kinsbury, Latty, Munson, Paulding, Roselms, Scantic, Trumbull, Watchung, Weir and Wetzel series are similar soils in related families.  Albano have mixed mineralogy.  Bergland, Kanona, Latty, Munson, Paulding, and Scantic soils do not have argillic horizons.  Canadice, Concord, Condit, Trumbull, Watchung, Weir, and Wetzel soils have less than 60 percent clay in the solum.  Covington soils have Mollic epipedons.  Indus soils have smectitic mineralogy.  Kingsbury and Roselms soils have chroma of 3 or more in some subhorizons above 30 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Panton soils are nearly level to gently sloping soils on lake and marine plains.  They are on broad plains and in depressions and drainageways and on sideslopes of swells and knolls.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in calcareous glaciolacustrine or estuarine clays associated with the end of the Wisconsin glaciation.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 36 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F.  The growing season ranges from 135 to 165 days."

The moderately well drained Vergennes, poorly drained Covington, and very poorly drained Livingston soils are associated in a drainage sequence with Panton soils.  Elmwood, Melrose, Swanton, and Whately soils are on outwash landforms and are moderately coarse textured in the upper part of the solum."

    "content": "REMARKS:  1.  This series has been classified to the 6th edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy with this revision.  The former classification was very-fine, illitic, mesic Typic Ochraqualfs.  2.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap and Eg horizons).\nb. Argillic horizon - the zone from 8 to 46 inches (Btg horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL lab data is available for the typical pedon, S58VT-1-3 (1-10) and for other pedons S58VT-1-1 (1-6), S73VT-1-2, S73VT-1-4, S79VT-21-3 (1-3), and S81VT-21-1 (1-3).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
