    "content": "REMARKS: Piccowaxen soils were previously mapped as Elkton, Keyport, Mattapex, and Othello soils. The Piccowaxen series is mapped on the Maryland Point geologic formation along the Potomac and Wicomico Rivers.  The lithologic discontinuity is attributed to spatially variable carbonates which are derived from buried oyster bars.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches) (A1, A2 and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 23 to 142 cm  (9 to 56 inches) (Bt1, Btg1, Bt2, Btg2, and Btg3 horizons)\nAquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within the upper 60 cm of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year\nOther soil features identified with this pedon:\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 152 cm (0 to 60 inches)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for the typical pedon is available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory.  Pedon ID: S04MD-017-002.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
