    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Prey soils are on alluvial fans and terraces at elevations of 1,400 to 1,555 meters. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks with minor amounts from other igneous rocks and gneiss. The climate is cool, semi-arid with a mean annual precipitation of 200 to 400 mm. The mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 95 to 120 days."
