  "OVERVIEW": "The Packerjohn series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils with rapid permeability that formed in colluvium from granitic rocks mixed with volcanic ash in the upper part. Slopes range from 4 to 90 percent in mountains. The average annual precipitation is about 32 inches and the average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
