    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Peone soils are on alluvial fans, flood plains, drainageways and depressional areas at elevations of 1,530 to 3,000 feet. They formed in volcanic ash, diatomite and recent alluvium of mixed mineralogy. They are in a continental temperate climate, have relatively dry summers and cool, moist winters. The average January temperature is 26 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 68 degrees F. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 25 inches. The frost free season is 80 to 130 days."

Colville soils have a fine-silty control section. Hardesty soils have a mollic epipedon and are on treads on stream terraces in higher positions. Kronquist soils have a fine-loamy control section and are in depressions of bottomlands. Narcisse soils have a mollic epipedon and a coarse-loamy control section and are on treads of stream terraces in higher positions."

Since the soil was established in 1917, there has been a continuous accumulation of alluvium from mixed loess and ash which required an update to the series concept. Lab data is also consistent with data collected for the Hoodoo taxadjunct in Spokane County, which is a similar soil in frigid temperature regime.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data available for Soil Survey Sample Number: S01-WA-063-005 Spokane County, Washington; NSSL Pedon Number: 02N0116.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
