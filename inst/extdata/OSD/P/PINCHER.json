RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Dominant colors in the A horizon range from 10YR 2/1 through 10YR 2/2.  Colors in the B horizon range from 10YR 3/2 through 2.5Y 4/4.  In the C horizons they range from 5Y 4/2 through 5Y 4/3.  Mottles may or may not occur in the C horizon.  The substratum is usually stratified with layers of sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, and silt loam, but strata vary in thickness and some pedons are dominantly silty or sandy.  Pebbles may occur in some strata, and some pedons have lenses of gravelly sand."

The Kasilof soils are formed in very shallow loess over sandy-skeletal substrata.  The Naptowne soils are formed in shallow loess over loamy gravelly till.  The Tustumena soils are formed in shallow loess over sandy-skeletal substrata."
