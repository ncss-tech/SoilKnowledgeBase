  "OVERVIEW": "The Perceton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sedimentary rocks.  Perceton soils are on hills, ridges, and mountain side slopes. Slopes range from 4 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.",

Edloe, Sapphire, Swapps, and Woodrock soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 100 cm.  Grimstone and Tongue River soils have argillic horizons with less than 35 percent fine or coarser mica of sufficient size to influence the soils physical character.  Indart soils developed in parent material weathered from redbeds, shales, and sandstones and have lithochromic hue of 5YR or redder.  Lick, Peeler, Swifton, Trapper, Uinta, and Whitefish soils lack a paralithic contact at depths of less than 100 cm.
