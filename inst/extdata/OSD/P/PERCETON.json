  "OVERVIEW": "The Perceton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sedimentary rocks.  Perceton soils are on hills, ridges, and mountain side slopes and have slopes of about 4 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 40 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is about 51 degrees F.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent in all subhorizons of the argillic horizon.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the top of the argillic horizon is less than 24 inches and depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 17 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in a major part of the solum and any C horizon and these are mainly 1/4 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A1 horizon, if present, has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically sandy clay loam but averages 18 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 30 percent silt, and 40 to 75 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  This horizon ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline."

Edloe, Sapphire, Swapps, and Woodrock soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Grimstone and Tongue River soils have argillic horizons with less than 35 percent fine or coarser mica of sufficient size to influence the soils physical character.  Indart soils developed in parent material weathered from redbeds, shales, and sandstones and have lithochromic hue of 5YR or redder.  Lick, Peeler, Swifton, Trapper, Uinta, and Whitefish soils lack a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Tahoma soils lack A2 or A&B horizons and have strongly or very strongly acid B2t horizons."

These soils formed in moderately thin, moderately coarse textured noncalcareous material weathered from soft sedimentary sandstone and interbedded loamstone.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  Mean annual temperature is 36 degrees F., and mean summer temperature is 52 degrees F."
