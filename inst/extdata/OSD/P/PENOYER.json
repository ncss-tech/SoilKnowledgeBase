  "OVERVIEW": "The Penoyer series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in silty alluvium derived from limestone, volcanic rocks and lacustrine deposits. Penoyer soils are on inset fans, fan skirts, alluvial flats, flood plains, lake plains, basin floors, and alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",

Smaug soils have platy structure in the particle-size control section and are not moist for 10 to 20 days from July to September due to convective storms. Toano soils have Bk horizons and are not moist for the 10 to 20 days during the summer. Yipor soils have soil temperatures of 8 to 11 degrees C., and are dry in the summer."
