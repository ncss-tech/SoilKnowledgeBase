Smaug soils have platy structure in the particle-size control section and are not moist for 10 to 20 days from July to September due to convective storms. Toano soils have Bk horizons and are not moist for the 10 to 20 days during the summer. Yipor soils have soil temperatures of 8 to 11 degrees C., and are dry in the summer."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Slopes are 0 to 4 percent but are generally less than 1 percent. Elevations are 1,070 to 2,130 meters. Penoyer soils formed in silty alluvium derived from limestone, andesite, volcanic ash, basalt, tuff, sandstone and lacustrine deposits. The annual precipitation is 150 to 225 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degree C, and the frost-free season is 130 to 170 days."

Geer and Seaman soils have a particle-size control section that contains more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand."
