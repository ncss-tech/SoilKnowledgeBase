  "OVERVIEW": "The Pappascreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in moderately coarse alluvium from mixed sources with strata of coarse alluvium from granite or other coarse grained, igneous or metamorphic rocks.  These soils are on drainageways and along the margins of floodplains in foothills and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
