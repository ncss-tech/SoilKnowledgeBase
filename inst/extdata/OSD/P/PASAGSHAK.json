  "REVDATE": "11/2002",
  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pasagshak series consists of deep, poorly drained soils formed in volcanic ash overlying very gravelly silty alluvium.  Pasagshak soils are on floodplains.  Slopes range from 0 to 7 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 60 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the recent volcanic ash ranges from 9 to 24 inches.  Texture of the uppermost layers ranges from silt loam to loamy fine sand.  In places, a thin recent deposit of alluvial silt may overlie the ash.  The buried layer of gravel free silty alluvium is commonly about 2 inches thick; it ranges in thickness from less than 1 inch to 4 inches.  Lenses of silty material may occur in the Cb horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pasagshak soils occur on floodplains.  They are formed in alluvium derived from dark colored ashy soils on adjacent uplands.  The climate is cool maritime.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 70 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.  Temperatures below freezing are recorded on fewer than 40 days annually, and temperatures above 70 degrees F. are rare."

Kizhuyak soils consist of thick alluvial accumulations of volcanic ash.  Kodiak soil have, under the recent ash deposit, dark reddish brown A horizons formed in older volcanic ash over till."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {

More data is needed to define the central concept or the series should be inactivated (jpm, 4/87).\nSource of the volcanic ash is the 1912 eruption of Mt. Novarupta and Mt.  Katmai on the Alaska Peninsula.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
