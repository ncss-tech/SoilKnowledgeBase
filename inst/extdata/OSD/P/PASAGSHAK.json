  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the recent volcanic ash ranges from 9 to 24 inches.  Texture of the uppermost layers ranges from silt loam to loamy fine sand.  In places, a thin recent deposit of alluvial silt may overlie the ash.  The buried layer of gravel free silty alluvium is commonly about 2 inches thick; it ranges in thickness from less than 1 inch to 4 inches.  Lenses of silty material may occur in the Cb horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pasagshak soils occur on floodplains.  They are formed in alluvium derived from dark colored ashy soils on adjacent uplands.  The climate is cool maritime.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 70 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.  Temperatures below freezing are recorded on fewer than 40 days annually, and temperatures above 70 degrees F. are rare."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Chiniak, Kizhuyak, and Kodiak series.  Chiniak soils consist of gravelly beach material below recent volcanic ash.  Kizhuyak soils consist of thick alluvial accumulations of volcanic ash.  Kodiak soil have, under the recent ash deposit, dark reddish brown A horizons formed in older volcanic ash over till."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Used as grazing land.  The native grasses are cut in places for hay and silage.  The vegetation is tall grass, dominated by bluejoint reedgrass, and associated plants such as fireweed.  In many places the soil supports stands of cottonwood and willows."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The concept of the Pasagshak series is poorly defined, especially in regards to the properties of the underlying material. More data is needed to define the central concept or the series should be inactivated (jpm, 4/87).\nSource of the volcanic ash is the 1912 eruption of Mt. Novarupta and Mt.  Katmai on the Alaska Peninsula.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
