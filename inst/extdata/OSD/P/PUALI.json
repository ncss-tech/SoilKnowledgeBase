    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Puali soils are on upper elvation, winward slopes of Mauna Loa Volcano at elevations from 1,220 to 1,524 meters (4000 to 5000 feet). The soils are in depressions of constructional landscapes consisting of nearly level to gently sloping pahoehoe lava flows that are 1,500 to 3,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 2 to 10 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over pahoehoe lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 1,524 to 2,540 millimeters (60 to 100 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 640 to 1,270 meters (25 to 50 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 15 degrees C. (52 to 59 degrees F.) The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)"
