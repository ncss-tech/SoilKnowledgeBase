  "OVERVIEW": "The Patricia series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian sediments in the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These soils are on very gently to gently sloping plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 457 mm (18 in) and the mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",

(Btk horizon)\nNote: The loamy textures generally are where deep plowing has mixed some of the underlying sandy clay loam with the overlying fine sand. The lower portion of the epipedon is designated as an E horizon in some pedons."
