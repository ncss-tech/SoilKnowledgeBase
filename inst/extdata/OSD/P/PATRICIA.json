The remainder is mid and short grasses such as sideoats grama, sand dropseed, hooded windmillgrass, sand lovegrass, sand paspalum, fall witchgrass, hairy grama, needle and thread, and perennial threeawn.

The lower portion of the epipedon is designated as an E horizon in some pedons.\nADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL Laboratory Data available: S95TX-445-047, S09TX445003, S95TX445147 (Terry County, Texas); S53TX305058, S53TX305064, S95TX-305-022, (Lynn County, Texas);\nSoil interpretations record: TX0115\nTaxonomy Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
