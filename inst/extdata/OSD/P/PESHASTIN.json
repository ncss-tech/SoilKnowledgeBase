  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 20 inches is 50 to 55 degrees F.  These soils are dry between depths of 8 and 24 inches more than half the time when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F (105 to 120 days).  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 75 percent dominantly acid igneous rock.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick.  Depth to secondary carbonates is 15 to 27 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It has weak platy, granular or subangular blocky structure.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam and is gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly, or very cobbly in some pedons.  It is 5 to 40 percent gravel, 0 to 25 cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.  It has weak subangular blocky, or prismatic structure. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Organic matter is less than one percent.  In some pedons the Bw horizon is absent.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam or coarse sandy loam and is very gravelly, extremely gravelly, very cobbly, extremely cobbly, or very stony.  It is 20 to 65 percent gravel, 10 to 35 percent cobbles and 0 to 20 percent stones.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a C horizon."

Heytou soils are dominantly basalt rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Nighthawk soils are weakly cemented in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Olex soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 55 to 59 degrees F and have a silt loam cambic horizon.  Haystack soils have carbonates at 30 to 44 inches.  Redcanyon soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.  Strat soils are dominated by sand and coarse sand in the lower part of the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Peshastin soils are on glacial moraines and terraces.  These soils formed in glacial outwash and ablation glacial till derived mainly from granite, schist, gneiss, and sandstone with a component of loess and volcanic ash in the surface.  Some ice-rafted deposits also occur.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Elevations range from 700 to 2,400 feet.  The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 74 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 190 days."

Aeneas and Pogue soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Burch, Cashmere, Cashmont, Farrell, Malaga, Malott, and Wenatchee soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section. Couleedam soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Logy soils have an irregular decrease in organic carbon content with increasing depth.  Quincy soils are sandy throughout."
