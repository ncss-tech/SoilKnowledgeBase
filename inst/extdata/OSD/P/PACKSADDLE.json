    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum and depth to schist bedrock range from 20 to 40 inches. The surface has a thin pavement of graphitic schist channers that range from less than an inch to about 6 inches long. Schist fragments range from 35 to 50 percent in the control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is channery or very channery fine sandy loam or loam. Clay content ranges from 12 to 20 percent. Channers range from 15 to 40 percent by volume. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is very channery sandy clay loam or clay loam. Clay content ranges from 25 to 35 percent. Coarse fragments range from 35 to 50 percent by volume. Reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe BCt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2.5 or 3, and chroma of 1. It is clay loam or sandy clay loam and very channery with a clay content of 25 to 35 percent. The graphitic schist channers range from less than an inch to 6 inches long. They make up from 35 to 65 percent by volume.\nThe Cr horizon is hard graphitic schist bedrock. The color is black or very dark gray. The bedrock is typically tilted 20 to 40 degrees from horizontal. It is underlain by indurated graphitic schist at depths of 4 to 6 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Similar soils are the Ligon and Nebgen series. Ligon soils average less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section. Nebgen soils have ochric epipedons and are shallow to sandstone bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Packsaddle soils are on ridges and knolls and formed in residuum derived from Precambrian graphitic schist bedrock. Slopes range from 3 to 8 percent. The climate is dry subhumid. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 27 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 66 to 67 degrees F. Frost free days range from 225 to 235 days and elevation ranges from 1,100 to 1,500 feet. Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 38 to 44."
