  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 80 inches or more.  Content of silt plus clay is less than 5 percent between depths of 10 to 40 inches.  Lamellae occur in the soil at depths below 50 inches, generally increasing in thickness with depth.  Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Streaks or pockets of uncoated sand grains range from none to common.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe E part of the E&B horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is 2 to 8 inches thick between the lamellae.  Small pockets of clean sand grains in shades of gray or white in the E part of this horizon range from none to common.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe B part of the E&B horizon is discontinuous lamellae with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The lamellae range from 2 to 8mm in thickness and 1/2 to 24 inches in length.  Texture of the lamellae is fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sandy loam."

The climate is humid semitropical.  The average annual temperature ranges from 67 to 72 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 55 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Albany, Blanton, Centenary, Ortega, and Troup soils.  Albany, Blanton, and Troup soils have sandy surface and subsurface horizons 40 to 80 inches thick underlain by Bt horizons.  In addition, Albany soils are on lower positions and are somewhat poorly drained, Blanton soils are on lower positions and are moderately well to somewhat excessively drained, and Troup soils are on similar positions and are somewhat excessively drained.  The well to somewhat excessively drained Centenary soils are on lower positions and have a Bh horizon below 50 inches.  The moderately well drained Ortega series are on lower positions and do not have lamellae."

The natural vegetation is dominantly turkey oak, bluejack oak, post oak, scrub live oak, and longleaf pine.  The understory is chiefly a sparse growth of pineland threeawn, indiangrass, creeping bluestem, and panicums."
