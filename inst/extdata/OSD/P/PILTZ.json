The thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches and is the same as the depth to bedrock.  Rock fragments are mainly gravel.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 5.  This horizon is gravelly clay loam or gravelly clay and is 35 to 50 percent clay.  Coarse fragments make up 15 to 35 percent of horizon."

Judy, Little Horn, and Sneffels soils have a lithic contact at a depth less than 40 inches.  Florissant soils have an indurated Cca horizon.  Mayoworth soils have a 0 to 15 percent rock fragment in the particle-size control section. Owen Creek soils are continuously calcareous in some part of the solum and C horizon and have a continuous horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation."
