  "OVERVIEW": "The Plott series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on cool, north- to east-facing or shaded ridges and side slopes in the Southern Blue Ridge mountains, MLRA 130B. These soils formed in residuum that is affected by soil creep in the upper part and weathered from felsic to mafic igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 79 inches. Slope ranges from 8 to 95 percent.",

  "COMPETING SERIES": {

Cheoah and Santeetlah soils formed in materials weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks such as phyllite and slate, and contain fragments of those rocks. Tuckasegee soils formed in colluvium and have C horizons of colluvial material rather than saprolite."

Elevation ranges from about 3,200 to 4,800 feet. These soils are on cool, north to east aspects or those slopes shaded by higher mountains. Slope is commonly between 30 to 80 percent but ranges from 8 to 95 percent. Plott soils formed in residuum, affected by soil creep in the upper part, weathered from felsic to mafic, igneous or high-grade metamorphic rocks such as granite, hornblende gneiss, mica gneiss, amphibolite, and high-grade metagraywacke. Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 50 to 80 inches."

Burton, Craggey, and Wayah soils are in a frigid soil temperature class, and are at higher elevations. Additionally, Burton soils have lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches, and Craggey soils have lithic contact at depths less than 20 inches. Chestnut and Edneyville soils have ochric epipedons and are on warmer and drier parts of the landscapes, typically on south to west aspects. Cullasaja, Haywood, Toecane, and Tusquitee soils formed in colluvium, have C horizons of colluvial material, and are in coves and on toe slopes at locally lower elevations. Porters soils have lithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches and have a thinner A horizons."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of this soil is in forest. The dominant forest type consists of northern red oak associated with black cherry, sugar maple, American beech, black oak, black birch, yellow birch, yellow-poplar, eastern hemlock, and black locust. In the drier, warmer part of the range, upland oaks, hickory, blackgum, red maple, and eastern white pine are associated. Flowering dogwood, mountain-laurel, silverbell, striped maple, serviceberry, rhododendron, red maple, blueberry, trillium, Solomons seal, and woodfern are common understory species. Approximately 20 percent of this soil is cleared and used for pasture, ornamentals, and Christmas trees."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Plott series was formerly included with the Porters series. However, the Porters series has hard bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches below the surface, and has an A horizon that is 6 to 10 inches thick.\nThe 1/97 revision placed Plott soils in a fine-loamy particle-size class. This series was formerly placed in a coarse-loamy particle-size class. Laboratory PSA (pipette method) and corresponding field texture estimates (feel method) indicate control section clay contents of generally 12 to 24 percent, with most pedons marginally coarse-loamy. Fine-loamy particle-size class placement is based on the presence of amorphous (non-crystalline) clay-size material associated with the relatively high organic matter content found in these soils. Although field estimates, laboratory measurements, and calculated values may vary, clay content in the particle-size control section is generally less than 25 percent. Although Plott soils may exhibit some of the characteristics of andic soil properties, they lack the volcanic glass found in soils of similar taxa in the Western United States.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon  the mineral soil surface  to 15 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)\nCambic horizon - 15 to 63 inches (Bw1, Bw2 and BC horizons)\nIsotic mineralogy class - In more than one-half of the control section, a 1500 kPa water to clay ratio of 0.6 or more and a pH in NaF solution of more than 8.4."
