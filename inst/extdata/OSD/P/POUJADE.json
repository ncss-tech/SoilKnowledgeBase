  "OVERVIEW": "The Poujade series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks with surficial eolian mantles of loess or sand.  Poujade soils are on low lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.5 degrees C.",
