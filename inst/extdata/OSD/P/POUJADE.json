    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Poujade soils are on low lake terraces.  These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks with surficial eolian mantles of loess or sand.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  Elevations range from 1,219 to 1,372 meters.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

Crowcamp soils are on depressions on low lake terraces and have mollic epipedons.  Lawen soils are coarse-loamy and are on high lake terraces.  Lolak soils are in drainageways and depressions on low old lake terraces and are poorly drained."
