  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Packer soils are on mountains. They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from metamorphic and volcanic rocks. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 1,980to 3,048 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days. In some areas, frost is likely to occur in any month."
