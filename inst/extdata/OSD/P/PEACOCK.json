  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Peacock soils occur on broad ridges and upper slopes of mountains. Slopes are 9 to 50 percent. Elevations are 28 to 805 meters (90 to 2640 feet). The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from schist and sandstone. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 2030 to 2550 millimeters (80 to 100 inches). Mean January temperature is about 7 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 13 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is 240 to 280 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 22 centimeters (A1 & A2 horizons)\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 22 to 200 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, Bt5 & BCt horizons)\n3. Ultisol feature - base saturation of 20 percent at the critical depth, 125 centimeters below the upper boundary of the argillic horizon\n4. Palehumult features - Clay remains at least 93 percent of its maximum to a depth of 200 centimeters\n5. Particle-size control section - the zone from 22 to 72 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3), averages 41 percent clay, by weight, and 12 percent rock fragments, by volume.\n5. Parasesquic mineralogy - There is 24 percent dithionite-extractible sesquioxides in the clay fraction of the particle size control section.\nADDITIONAL DATA: A similar soil, the Trailhead series type pedon is field sample number S83-CA-12-01, analyzed at Oregon State University and at NSSL. Backup samples S83-CA-12-02 and S83-CA-12-03 were analyzed for mineralogy class at NSSL. University of California samples 60-CA-12-17X and 60-CA-12-18X was collected for the Soil-Vegetation Survey in Redwood National Park.\nNASIS User Pedon ID:  04CA605REDW075\nSoil classified using the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
