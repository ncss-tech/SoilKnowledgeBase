  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinery series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in gravelly fan alluvium from limestone parent material. Pinery soils are on moderately sloping to moderately steep alluvial fans. Slopes are 1 to 25 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 411 mm (16 in).",
