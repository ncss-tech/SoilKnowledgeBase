  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The combined thickness of the organic layers exceeds 51 inches. Woody fragments range from 0 to 30 percent.\nThe layers in the surface tier consist dominantly of hemic materials, but in some pedons they are composed of fibric or sapric material. Fibric horizons are dominantly sphagnum moss and have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 6. These layers are derived from herbaceous plants and sphagnum moss. Structure in the surface tier is dominantly platy, but is granular or massive in some pedons.\nThe subsurface and bottom tiers range from platy structure to massive. Reaction throughout the control section ranges from extremely acid to very strongly acid in water (pH less than 4.5 in 0.01M calcium chloride).\nLayers within the control section have a hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y; value of 2 to 5; and chroma of 0 to 4. Colors commonly become darker on brief exposure to air."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Citypoint and Loxley series are in the same family. Citypoint and Loxley are from outside Region R. Citypoint soils have a paralithic contact within 51 inches. Loxley soils formed in organic material derived from herbaceous plants.\nSeries in closely related families are the Beseman, Carbondale, Carlisle, Burnt Vly, Greenwood, Houghton, Lupton, and Rifle series. Beseman soils have loamy mineral material within 51 inches of the surface. Carbondale soils have layers of hemic material exceeding 10 inches in thickness in the subsurface and bottom tiers. Carlisle and Houghton soils are mesic. Burnt Vly soils have sandy material within 51 inches of the surface. Greenwood and Rifle soils consist dominantly of hemic materials. Lupton soils are less acid in the subsurface and bottom tiers."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Pleasant Lake soils are in depressions on kame moraines, lake plains, outwash plains, and on floodplains. In some places they are in depressions on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The mineral soils in the surrounding upland are commonly derived from acid parent materials. The mean annual precipitation ranges from about 30 to 50 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from about 38 to 46 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Burnt Vly, Adirondack, Sabattis and Tughill soils. The Burnt Vly soils are organic soils that are 16 to 51 inches deep to sandy mineral deposits. The Adirondack soils are somewhat poorly drained, and the Sabattis and Tughill soils are very poorly drained, sandy mineral soils commonly near the edges of the Pleasant Lake soils or as inclusions within the Pleasant Lake soils where the organic deposit is less than 16 inches thick."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. The depth to the seasonal high water table ranges from 1 foot above the surface to 1 foot below the surface from November to May. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity ranges from moderately high to very high."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Very little intensive use is made of these soils because of excess wetness, extreme acidity, and frost hazard. Soil areas usually lack suitable drainage outlets. Ground cover consists principally of blueberry, leatherleaf, sphagnum moss, and wintergreen. Trees are limited to a few scattered black spruce, jack pine, quaking aspen, and tamarack."
