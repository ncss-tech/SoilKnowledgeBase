  "OVERVIEW": "The Purgatory series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over alluvium from gypsiferous shale.  Purgatory soils are on plateaus and mesas and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
