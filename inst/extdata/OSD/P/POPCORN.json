  "OVERVIEW": "The Popcorn series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum and slope alluvium derived from limestone. Popcorn soils are on hills and mountains. Slope ranges from 10 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
