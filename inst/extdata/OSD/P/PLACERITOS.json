    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Placeritos soils are on stream terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks that are dominantly basalt, tuff, limestone, and rhyolite.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,190 to 1,220 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 180 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (Ap horizon).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 120 and 150 cm\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (C2 horizon and parts of the C1 and C3 horizons).\nThe revision of April 2006 updated the taxonomic class from Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Oxyaquic Xerofluvents based on the moisture regime being torric instead of xeric.  Placeritos components in Box Elder County Utah are now correlated to the Beariver series.  A Placeritos component in Elko County, Nevada needs correlation to another series.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  There are several pedons of Placeritos 56NV027011 (pedon # 40A3205) and 56NV027012 (pedon # 40A3206) which now plot within polygons of Swingler map units.  They are published in Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 23 on pages 122-125.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
