    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pistolriver soils are on flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Elevations are 6 to 24 meters (20 to 79 feet).  The climate is humid, characterized by warm wet winters and warm moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F).  The mean annual precipitation is 1778 to 2286 millimeters (70 to 90 inches).  The frost-free period is 270 to 330 days."

This soil was first correlated as a Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid, isomesic Aeric Tropaquent in 1995, Formerly classified as coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid, isomesic Aeric Tropaquepts, competing series not updated at that time of reclassification.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\nMollic epipedon - from the surface to a depth of 28 centimeters (11 inches) base saturation (by NH4OAc) is greater than 50 percent. (A1, and A2 horizons)\nCambic horizon - from a depth of 28 to 64 centimeters (16 to 25 inches) (Bw1 and Bw2 horizon).\nAquepts suborder - Matrix with a chroma of 2 within 50 centimeters of the soil surface with redoximorphic concentrations (Bw1, Bw2 horizons).\nSoil classified using the 11th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNASIS Pedon User ID: 95OR015003.\nAdditional data KSSL: Pedon ID #S02CA-023-007\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
