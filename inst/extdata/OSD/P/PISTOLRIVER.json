  "OVERVIEW": "The Pistolriver series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that have formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Pistolriver soils are on flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 2030 millimeters (80 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
