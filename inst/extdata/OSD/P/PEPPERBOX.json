  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to 80 inches. Depth to a lithologic discontinuity ranges from 24 to 40 inches and is typically 30 to 40 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid when the soil has not been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The texture is loamy sand or sand.\nThe E horizons have a hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Textures are loamy sand or sand.\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 10YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Iron depletions with chroma 2 or less occur in the lower parts of the horizon.  The texture is typically sandy loam but in some pedons it is loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe 2Btg horizon has a hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less. This horizon has high chroma iron concentrations, or is variegated and lacking of a single dominant matrix color.  The textures are sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, or sandy clay, and may be stratified with thin lenses of coarser textured materials in the lower part.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 2, or is neutral with value of 4 through 7.  Some pedons are variegated with iron depletions and iron concentrations and lack a dominant matrix color.  Stratified textures range from loamy sand to sandy clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other known series in the same family. Similar soils in other families are the Matawan and Runclint soils. Matawan soils do not have sandy surface layers thicker than 20 inches and subsoil clay decreases by greater than 20 percent from the maximum within 60 inches.  Runclint soils are well drained, have sandy textures to greater than 40 inches and do not have argillic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pepperbox soils occur on broad interstream divides, which occur on level to nearly level areas of the North Atlantic Coastal Plain.  The soils formed in loamy Fluviomarine sediments overlain by stratified coarser-textured sediments that were partially reworked by wind or water. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 55 to 58 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 55 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hammonton, Hurlock, Klej, Matawan, and Runclint soils.  Hammonton and Hurlock soils occur on nearby depressional landscapes and do not have sandy surface horizons thicker than 20 inches.  Additionally, Hurlock soils have low chroma iron depletions or are gleyed immediately beneath the A horizon.  Klej, Matawan and Runclint soils occur on similar nearby landscapes.  Klej and Runclint soils are sandy to depths greater than 40 inches.  Runclint is well drained with a water table occurring below 48 inches.  Matawan soils have a fine-loamy particle size control section."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained. Permeability is moderately rapid in the A and E horizons, moderate in the Bt horizon, and slow in the 2Bt horizons and in the substratum. Water perches on the substratum, creating a seasonal high water table from approximately December through May. Index Surface Runoff is low to medium."

The 02/2005 revision updates the status from tentative to established (per correlation of Anne Arundel County, Maryland). Some minor edits were also made.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 25 inches (A1, A2, and E horizons).\nArenic feature - the zone from the surface to 25 inches (A1, A2, and E horizons).\nEluvial horizon - the zone from 10 to 25 inches (E horizon).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 25 to 65 inches (Bt, 2Btg1, and 2Btg2 horizons).\nAquic feature - the soil has mottles with chroma of 2 or less in the upper part of the Bt and a gray matrix with high chroma iron concentrations in the 2Btg1 and 2Btg2 horizons.\nUdult feature - no part of the moisture control section is dry for as long as 90 consecutive days.\nRevised: 11/2002-RLH,CDP; 02/2005-SLD,DHK,PSK\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data from characterization pedons S90DE-005-020, S90DE-005-020B and S90DE-005-020A are available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska NE.\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nDE0004 PEPPERBOX   0-  5   55- 58  175-200  36- 55    20-  40\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nDE0004 NONE          2.0-3.0  APPARENT JAN-APR  60-60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nDE0004  0-10  LS                      0-  0 100-100  4-12   1-  6\nDE0004 10-25  LS                      0-  0 100-100  2-10   1-  2\nDE0004 25-37  SL FSL L                0-  0  95-100  8-20   1-  4\nDE0004 37-80  SCL SICL SC             0-  0  95-100 20-40   3- 10\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
