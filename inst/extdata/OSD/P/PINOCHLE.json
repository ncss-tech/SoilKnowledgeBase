  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinochle series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from rhyolite.  Pinochle soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 710 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 3.9 degrees C.",
