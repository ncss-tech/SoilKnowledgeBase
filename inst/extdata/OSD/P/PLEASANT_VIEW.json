  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Pleasant View soils are dry for 60 or more consecutive days in all parts between 7 and 20 inches in more than 7 out of 10 years.\nTexture of the 10 to 40 inch control section is dominant gravelly loam, but some is gravely sandy loam. Clay content is less than 18 percent. Most of the coarse fragments are pebbles smaller than 1/2 inch in size, but there are some larger pebbles and cobbles. The content of coarse fragments increases with depth and is as much as 60 percent by volume below depths of 40 inches. The coarse fragments are coated with lime in some pedons, but they are not cemented.\nThe A horizon has hues of 10YR, values of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3. Texture ranges from loam to gravelly sandy loam. Content of organic matter ranges from 1.0 to 4.5 percent. In some places the surface layer is slightly calcareous due to accumulation of wind or water deposited material.\nThe calcium carbonate equivalent of the Ck horizon ranges from 12 to 25 percent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Related or similar soils are in the Ackmen, Kilburn, Ridd, and Timpanogos series. Ackmen soils lack gravel in the control section and lack horizons of carbonate accumulation. The Kilburn and Ridd soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick and are noncalcareous throughout. In addition, Kilburn soils have very gravelly fine sandy loam control sections, and Ridd soils have argillic horizons.  Timpanogos soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick, and argillic horizons of loam texture that are not gravelly or cobbly."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pleasant View soils are on alluvial fans and lake terraces. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. These soils have formed in alluvium dominantly from gneiss, schist, shale, and argillite. The climate is dry subhumid. The mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 52 F., the mean summer temperature ranges from 68 to 73 degrees F., and the freeze-free season from 150 to 175 days. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 20 inches."
