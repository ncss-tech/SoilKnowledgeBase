These soils are on ash and cinder covered `a`a lava flows. Underlying lava flows are 14,000 to 250,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 6 to 50 percent. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 400 to 600 millimeters (16 to 24 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1,520 to 1,780 millimeters (60 to 70 inches). The mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 14 degrees C (45 to 57 degrees F). The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
