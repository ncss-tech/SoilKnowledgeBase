  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinkham series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvial fan materials derived from gneiss, schist, and quartzite.  These soils are on alluvial fans, glacial moraines, till plains, and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent or more.  Mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about -1 degrees C.",
