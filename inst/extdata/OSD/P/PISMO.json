  "OVERVIEW": "The Pismo series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residual material weathered from soft sandstone.  Pismo soils are on uplands and have slopes of 9 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the man annual air temperature is about 58 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact of sandstone is 8 to 20 inches. The soil between the depths of 12 and 20 inches is usually moist from sometime in November to sometime in May and usually dry the rest of the year. The mean annual soil temperature is about 62 degrees to 65 degrees F. Organic matter is less than 1 percent below 1 to 4 inches. Texture throughout the soil profile is loamy sandy or sand. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid. Base saturation is assumed to be greater than 60 percent in some part of the profile.\nThe A horizon is gray, grayish brown or light brownish gray (10YR 5/1, 5/2, 6/1, 6/2) dry, very dark gray, very dark grayish brown, dark gray or dark grayish brown (10YR 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 4/2) moist.\nSome pedons have a C horizon with a color of light brownish gray, pale brown, (10YR 6/2, 6/3, 7/2, 7/3) dry, dark brown, brown or pale brown (10YR 4/3, 6/3) moist.\nThe Cr horizon is very pale brown or white (10YR 7/3, 7/4, 8/2, 8/3) dry, pale brown or light yellowish brown (10YR 6/3, 6/4) moist and crushes easily to a loamy sand or sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through medium acid. Most pedons have an accumulation of black sandy clay, clay, or silty clay which ranges from a thin film to 2 inches thick directly overlying the paralithic contact. Fractures in the parent material are less than 12 inches apart and the width of fractures is less than 1mm. Clay films and iron stains line the fractures. Fractures contain very fine and fine roots."

The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm, dry but foggy summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 22 inches. Average January temperature is 52 degrees F., average July temperature is 60 degrees F., mean annual temperature is 57 degrees to 60 degrees F. The frost-free season is 325 to 350 days."

Briones soils are 20 to 40 inches deep. San Andreas soils have a mollic epipedon, are coarse-loamy and have a paralithic contact at a depth of 24 to 40 inches. Corralitos soils are formed in alluvium. Tierra soils are on marine terraces and have a fine textured argillic horizon."
