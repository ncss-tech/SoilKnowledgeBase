  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinegap series consists of deep, well-drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum weathered from limestone. They are on hillsides and mountainsides. Permeability is moderate. Slopes are 35 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
