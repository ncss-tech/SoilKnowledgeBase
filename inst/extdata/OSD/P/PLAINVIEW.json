    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually dry.  They are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 120 to 150 days (cumulative).  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to glacial outwash deposits (2Bw) is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to a strongly cemented or indurated duripan is 50 inches or more.  The pumice sand content (0.5-2.0 mm) of the ash mantle is 20 to 60 percent. The ash mantle contains 50 to 80 percent volcanic glass and glass-coated aggregates in the very fine sand fraction, a phosphate retention of 50 to 70 percent, a 15-bar water content of 5 to 10 percent on dried and undried samples and acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron of 0.40 to 1.0 percent.  The ash mantle has a field estimated clay content of 5 to 15 percent.  Organic matter content is less than 1 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 to 3 dry and moist.  It is 0 to 10 percent gravel.  It is neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is neutral.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam with 30 to 60 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Total rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent.  It is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe 3C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is extremely gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly loamy sand with 35 to 50 percent gravel and 5 to 15 percent cobbles.  Total rock fragments range from 45 to 65 percent.  It is slightly alkaline.\nIn some pedons the indurated duripan is lacking or is strongly cemented."
