    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pasturerock soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes gradients are 15 to 50 percent. Elevations are 53 to 1220 meters (170 to 4000 feet). The soils formed in colluvium derived from sandstone and mudstone. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. This soil also has a dry phase when used in MLRA 5, where there is no marine layer influence in the summers. Mean annual precipitation is 1525 to 2550 millimeters (60 to 100 inches). Mean January temperature is about 7 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 15 degree C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 15 degree C (50 to 59 inches). Frost free season is about 200 to 260 days."

Coyoterock soils are in moist locations on poorly incised drainages, hillslope hollows, and earthflows. The Doolyville soils are on smooth to rounded earthflow slopes in moist locations below Pasturerock soils. Maneze soils are on convex slopes and spur ridges alongside Pasturerock soils."
