  "OVERVIEW": "The Piercepark series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderate permeability that formed in alluvium from granitic sediments and silty lacustrine deposits. Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent in valleys and foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Piercepark soils are gently sloping to moderately sloping on fan remnants and hill footslopes at elevations of 2,500 to 4,800 feet. Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from granitic sediments deposited as basin-margin subaqueous deltas and underlying silty lacustrine deposits. The average annual precipitation is 13 to 17 inches. The average annual temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 110 to 150 days."
