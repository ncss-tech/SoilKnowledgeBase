Coolbrith soils are somewhat poorly drained and have redoximorphic features in lower part of the profile. Blockhouse soils are moderately well drained, dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days (xeric) and have redoximorphic features in the lower profile. Deadpan soils are not currently in the database and cannot be competed.  Dotta soils are 27 to 50 inches deep to the base of the argillic horizon and have a xeric soil moisture regime.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Piercepark soils are gently sloping to moderately sloping on fan remnants and hill footslopes at elevations of 2,500 to 4,800 feet. Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from granitic sediments deposited as basin-margin subaqueous deltas and underlying silty lacustrine deposits. The average annual precipitation is 13 to 17 inches. The average annual temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 110 to 150 days."
