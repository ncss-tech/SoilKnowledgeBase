  "OVERVIEW": "The Palomas series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium.  Palomas soils are on broad plains, alluvial fans and piedmont slopes and have slopes of 1 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 64 degrees F.",

Where the upper boundary of the C horizon is at depths less than 40 inches, the C horizon is noncalcareous in the upper part.\nSegregated lime is lacking above 40 inches; below 40 inches concretions or soft bodies are few medium to fine.  In some pedons, the amount of lime increases below 50 inches."

Bryman, Dutchflat, Gralock, Hi Vista, and Neuralia soils are in the Mohave Desert.  Avenal and Milham soils are in the San Joaquin Valley.  These soils are moist in the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative between July and September.  Avenal soils particle size control section contains less than 50 percent sand and less than 5 percent rock fragments.  Anway soils particle size control section is dominantly 15 to 18 inches thick.  Bucklebar soils have calcium carbonate accumulation at less than 40 inches deep and do not have a cambic horizon above the argillic.  Dutchflat soils contain 15 to 35 percent rock fragment in the particle size control section.  Garlock soils have hue 7.5YR and yellower.  Hi Vista soils are moderately deep to granite bedrock.  Milham soils are calcareous and has 10YR hue throughout the profile."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Palomas soils are on broad plains, alluvial fans and piedmont slopes. Slopes range from less than 1 percent to about 9 percent. The regolith is sandy sediments from mixed sources, and it is low in carbonates. The climate is arid continental. At the type location the average annual temperature is 64 degrees F., average annual precipitation is 13 inches, and the Thornthwaite annual P-E Index is about 14. The largest amounts of precipitation fall during July and August."
