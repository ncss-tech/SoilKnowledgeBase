  "OVERVIEW": "The Pullman series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These soils occur on nearly level to very gently sloping plains or playa slopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 483 mm (19 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).",
