    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist but it is dry between 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 80 consecutive days in the four month period following the summer solstice.  The soil profile has cracks that open and close once each year.  Slickensides are close enough to intersect in all or some part between 10 and 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 56 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 60 or more inches.  The particle-size control section is 60 to 70 percent clay, 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Soft accumulations of carbonates are below a depth of 20 inches.  Depth to the 2Bk horizon, when present, is over 40 inches and has 15 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 3 or less moist and 3 or 4 dry, and has chroma of 1 or less both moist and dry.\nThe Bkss horizon is clay with hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, chroma of 1 or less where distinct mottling and lime concretions are absent.  The chroma ranges to 3 where mottling is distinct."
