  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonate ranges from 6 to 11 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 7 to 11 inches and extends into the Bt horizon.  Up to 35 percent by volume, granitic pebbles, cobbles, and stones that range to as much as 12 inches in diameter are in the surface layer and up to 15 percent by volume throughout the soil.   Most or all of the Bt horizon is incorporated with the A horizon in cultivated areas.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is loam or clay loam but is stony loam in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is clay loam or clay averaging between 35 to 45 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  Some pedons have accumulations of carbonates in the part.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a Btk horizon.\nThe Bk horizon and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  They are clay loam or clay and ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  They have few to many, fine or medium accumulations of carbonate in the Bk or C horizons.   Relic mottles are in the C horizon in some pedons.  Few or common nests of gypsum are in the C horizon of most pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Beadle, Carlson, Harney, Kirley, McClure, Mento, Raber, Reliance, and Spearville series.  Beadle soils are thicker to the base of the argillic horizon and are leached of carbonate to greater depths.  Carlson soils contain more carbonate in the C horizon.  Harney, Mento, Reliance, and Spearville soils contain less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand and formed in silty materials.   In addition, Mento soils contain 5 to 15 percent exchangeable sodium in the B and C horizons. Kirley soils have carbonate below depths of 11 inches and typically have thicker solums.  McClure soils contain less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand and have carbonate at greater depths.  Raber soils have thicker sola and are leached of carbonate to greater depths."

Peno soils formed in firm clay loam glacial till.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 21 inches."

Cavo, Demky, and Jerauld soils are on the smoother less sloping parts of the landscape.  Hoven soils are in depressions. Gettys soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are on nearby steeper landscapes.  Glenham soils are fine-loamy and the Oko soils contain more clay and have vertic characteristics.  Gettys and Oko soils are on similar landscapes."
