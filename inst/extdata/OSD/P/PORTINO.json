  "OVERVIEW": "The Portino series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and silty alluvium derived from loess and material weathered from basalt.  Permeability is moderate.  These soils are on lava plains and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Minidoka soils have a duripan at 20 to 40 inches.  Portneuf soils are greater than 60 inches deep.  Rad soils are greater than 60 inches deep and lack calcic horizons.  Thornock and Trevino soils are less than 20 inches deep.  Vining soils are coarse-loamy and lack calcic horizons.  Kimama and Knull soils are in depressional areas on basalt plains.  Minidoka soils are on similar landscapes.  Portneuf and Rad soils are on similar landscapes but in areas where the deposits overlying the basalt are thicker.  Thornock and Trevino soils are on similar landscapes but in areas where the deposits overlying the basalt are thinner.  Vining soils are on similar landscapes in areas of sandier parent materials."
