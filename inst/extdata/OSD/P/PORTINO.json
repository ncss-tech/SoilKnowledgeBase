    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Portino soils are on loess-mantled lava plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  They formed in loess and silty alluvium derived from loess and material weathered from basalt.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 11 inches.  Average annual temperature ranges from 45 to 53 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 100 to 155 days.  Elevation ranges from 3,500 to 4,700 feet."

Kimama soils are greater than 60 inches deep and are fine-silty.  Knull soils are greater than 40 inches deep, are fine-silty, and have natric horizons.  Minidoka soils have a duripan at 20 to 40 inches.  Portneuf soils are greater than 60 inches deep.  Rad soils are greater than 60 inches deep and lack calcic horizons.  Thornock and Trevino soils are less than 20 inches deep.  Vining soils are coarse-loamy and lack calcic horizons.  Kimama and Knull soils are in depressional areas on basalt plains.  Minidoka soils are on similar landscapes.  Portneuf and Rad soils are on similar landscapes but in areas where the deposits overlying the basalt are thicker.  Thornock and Trevino soils are on similar landscapes but in areas where the deposits overlying the basalt are thinner.  Vining soils are on similar landscapes in areas of sandier parent materials."
