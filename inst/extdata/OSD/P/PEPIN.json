Where the value moist is 3, the value dry is 6 or more.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is clay, clay loam, silty clay, silty clay loam, or the channery, very channery, flaggy, very flaggy, gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly, or very cobbly analogs. Clay content is 35 percent or more.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is sandy loam, clay loam, loam, or the channery, very channery, flaggy, very flaggy, gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly, or very cobbly analogs.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe R horizon is dolostone.  It is a lithic contact with fractures more than 4 inches apart."

A similar soil is the Village series.  Marseilles, Mayville, Minnith, and Uniontown soils will be reclassified as Oxyaquic Hapludalfs. Baraboo, Dubuque, and Knowles soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Bertrand and Jackson soils have sandy texture at 40 to 60 inches.  Blackhammer, Camden, Fayette, Flagg, Hackers, Mentor, Piscasaw, Ruma, Rush, Russell, Seaton, Westmore, and Yellowriver soils do not have texture with 35 percent or more clay in the lower part of the series control section.  Cadiz, Dodge, Lomira, Pottersville, Stubenville, and Zurich soils have free carbonates in the series control section.  Inton soils have redox features and saturation within the series control section. Jemerson, Ridgway, Sandview, and Weingarten soils have mean annual soil temperature of 54 degrees F. or more.   La Farge and Westbend soils have a paralithic contact within the series control section.  Martinsburg, Menfro, and Palsgrove soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Village soils are fine-silty over clayey."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pepin soils are on hills in bedrock controlled uplands. Slope gradients range from 2 to 30 percent. These soils formed in loess, in clayey pedisediment, and, in some pedons, in loamy residuum from the underlying dolostone bedrock.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 1000 to 1300 feet."

Native vegetation is mixed deciduous forest.  Common trees are northern red oak, sugar maple, basswood, American elm, white ash, and green ash."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Prior to 1994, this soil was mapped as the Dubuque (deep phase), Palsgrove, or Seaton series.  The clayey pedisediment is of uncertain origin.  Currently it is thought to be a depositional feature and is locally referred to as the \"Rountree Formation\".  In the past it was thought to be clayey residuum from dolostone.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon: ochric epipedon - 0 to 9 inches (Ap); argillic horizon - 9 to 66 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, 2Bt5, 3Bt6).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Record - WI0581.  Refer to soil survey sample numbers S93WI-091-019 and S93WI-091-021 for NSSL data on some Pepin pedons.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
