  "OVERVIEW": "The Pepin series consists of well drained soils which are deep or very deep to a lithic contact with dolostone bedrock on hills in bedrock controlled uplands.  These soils formed in loess, in clayey pedisediment, and in loamy residuum from the underlying dolostone bedrock.  Permeability is moderate in the loess, slow in the pedisediment, moderate in the residuum, and slow to moderate in the dolostone.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Baraboo, Dubuque, and Knowles soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Bertrand and Jackson soils have sandy texture at 40 to 60 inches.  Blackhammer, Camden, Fayette, Flagg, Hackers, Mentor, Piscasaw, Ruma, Rush, Russell, Seaton, Westmore, and Yellowriver soils do not have texture with 35 percent or more clay in the lower part of the series control section.  Cadiz, Dodge, Lomira, Pottersville, Stubenville, and Zurich soils have free carbonates in the series control section.  Inton soils have redox features and saturation within the series control section. Jemerson, Ridgway, Sandview, and Weingarten soils have mean annual soil temperature of 54 degrees F. or more.   La Farge and Westbend soils have a paralithic contact within the series control section.  Martinsburg, Menfro, and Palsgrove soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Prior to 1994, this soil was mapped as the Dubuque (deep phase), Palsgrove, or Seaton series.  The clayey pedisediment is of uncertain origin.  Currently it is thought to be a depositional feature and is locally referred to as the \"Rountree Formation\".  In the past it was thought to be clayey residuum from dolostone.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon: ochric epipedon - 0 to 9 inches (Ap); argillic horizon - 9 to 66 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, 2Bt5, 3Bt6).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Record - WI0581.
