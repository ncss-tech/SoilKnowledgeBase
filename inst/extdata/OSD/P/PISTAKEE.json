  "OVERVIEW": "The Pistakee series consists of somewhat poorly drained soils that occupy narrow areas in drainageways and at the base of slopes. These soils formed in moderately light colored, silty alluvium that was deposited over an older buried soil. Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: There is limited historical documentation available for Pistakee Series other than what is published in the Soil Survey of Milwaukee and Waukesha Counties, Wisconsin (1971) and in the McHenry County [Illinois] Soils, Soil Report 81 (1965). The taxonomic classification of Pistakee Series in the Milwaukee and Waukesha report is coarse-silty, mixed, nonacid, mesic Aquic Udifluvents. The Pistakee silt loam in Soils Report 81 is assigned to the Alluvial soils Great Soil Group.\nThe Wisconsin NRCS State Office requested that null or missing OSD information be populated in the OSD Database so it can be accessed for reference. These references are critical for NRI sampling verification, program eligibility for onsite, and compliance review and checks. The status of the Pistakee Series was inactive in the Official Soil Series database and no OSD was available.\nThe Pistakee Series is presently correlated only in Wisconsin but is believed to have been established in McHenry County, Illinois in 1965. The description of Pistakee silt loam in Soil Report 81 contains minimal information and does not contain a location of the representative profile. To satisfy the request from Wisconsin NRCS State Office, the typical profile from Waukesha County was used to develop this 03/2025 OSD. With this revision, the Pistakee Series is now reactivated until field investigations are conducted to evaluate the range in properties and extent.\nThe OSD ranges are  based on data available in the Soil Survey of Milwaukee and Waukesha Counties, Wisconsin (1971) and in NASIS (DMU Rec ID 270992). No changes were made to the original typical profile from the 1971 soil survey report. The low chroma colors in the upper part of the profile are the result of the kind of material in which these soils formed; they are not the result of poor drainage."
