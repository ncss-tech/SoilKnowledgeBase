  "OVERVIEW": "The Prieta series consists of shallow, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in eolian material and alluvium weathered from basalt.  Prieta soils are on basalt flows and mesas and have slopes of 1 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
