    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and depth to the base of soil development is 50 to 80 inches. Loess thickness typically is 55 to 80 inches. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay,\nand the maximum clay content in any subhorizon is 48 percent. Sand content of the Ap and Eg horizons is less than 15 percent and includes iron-manganese nodules and concretions. Sand content is less than 7 percent in the particle-size control section. Carbonates, where present, are below a depth of 5 feet.\nSome pedons contain krotovina. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 56 to slightly less than 59 degrees F.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. Some undisturbed pedons have a thin A horizon with a color value of 3. Clay content averages 12 to 25 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral, depending on the liming history.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam or silt. Clay content averages 10 to 22 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid when not limed. Pedons that have been limed range to neutral.\nSome pedons have a B/E horizon less than 3 inches in thickness immediately below the Eg horizon.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2. Redoximorphic features have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or are neutral; value of 2 to 7; and chroma of 0 to 8. It is silty clay loam or silty clay and the zone of maximum clay is in the upper part. Clay content is 35 to 45 percent in the upper part and is 27 to 42 percent in the lower part. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid in the upper part and very strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part.\nSome pedons have a BCg horizon. It is silty clay loam or silt loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Cg or 2Cg horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 0 to 2. It typically is silt loam, but some pedons have a 2Cg horizon or buried horizons of older soils below a depth of 55 inches. These horizons are silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam. Sand content is 7 to 30 percent. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ames, Leaksville, Rushville, Watchung, Wynoose, and Zwingle series. Ames and Wynoose soils average more than 15 percent sand in some horizon within a depth of 40 inches.  Leaksville soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 40 inches.  Rushville soils have a mean annual soil\ntemperature less than 56 degrees F. Watchung soils are less than 40 inches to the base of the argillic horizon.  Zwingle soils average more than 50 percent clay in the particle size control section and have hue redder than 10YR in the subsoil."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pierron soils are on nearly level or slightly depressional parts of broad interfluves on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. These soils formed in more than 55 inches of loess. In pedons with less than 80 inches of loess, the lower part of the soil formed in silty pedisediment that contains a component of sand. Mean annual temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 36 to 40 inches, frost-free period is 170 to 200 days, and elevation is 400 to 800 feet above sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Coulterville, Cowden, Darmstadt, Marine, Oconee, and Homen soils. The somewhat poorly drained Coulterville, Darmstadt, Marine, and Oconee soils and the moderately well drained Homen soils are on convex summits and side slopes above the Pierron soils or on side slopes of drainageways below them. In addition Darmstadt soils have a natric horizon, Coulterville soils contain a oncentration of sodium in the subsoil, and Oconee soils have a dark surface layer. The poorly drained Cowden soils have a dark surface layer and are on similar landscape positions as the Pierron soils."
