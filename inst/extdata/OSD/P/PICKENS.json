    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum and depth to hard shale ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The soil is channery,very channery or extremely channery silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam, with 15 to 30 percent clay.\nThe A horizon is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark brown (10YR 3/3; 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4), dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4, 4/4), brown (10YR 4/3; 7.5YR 4//2, 4/4), or dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2).  It ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid.  Shale fragments 3 to 10 inches in diameter comprise from 0 to 5 percent of the volume and shale fragments less than 3 inches in diameter comprise from 20 to 60 percent of the volume.\nThe E horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), brown (10YR 4/3, 5/3; 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 5/2, 5/4), dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), pale brown (10YR 6/3), light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2), or light brown (7.5YR 6/4). It ranges from strongly acid through medium acid.  Shale fragments are similar to those in the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon is brown (10YR 4/3, 5/3; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4), dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), olive brown (2.5Y 4/4), light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4, 5/6), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6), or strong brown (7.5YR 5/6).  It ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid.  Shale fragments 3 to 10 inches in diameter comprise from 0 to 10 percent of the volume and shale fragments less than 3 inches in diameter comprise from 35 to 85 percent of the volume.\nThe R layer is in shades of gray or brown.  It ranges from neutral through moderately alkaline.  It is tilted as much as 20 degrees from horizontal."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Manteo is the only other series in this family.  Manteo soils have coarse fragments of schist.  Similar soils in other families include Hector, Montevallo, Ramsey and Sulphura.  Hector soils have less than 35 percent fragments larger than 2 mm.  Montevallo soils are shallow over bedrock that has a hardness of less than 3 on Mohs scale.  Ramsey soils have mean annual soil temperature of less than 59 degrees F.  Sulphura soils have Bt (argillic) horizons in part of the pedon."
