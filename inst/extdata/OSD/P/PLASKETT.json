  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to lithic contact of hard but fractured rock ranges from 6 to 20 inches.  Dominantly, the soils are more than 10 inches deep.  The mean annual soil temperature at the lithic contact ranges from 55 degrees to 58 degrees F.  The soil below the upper few inches usually is continuously moist from some time in October or November until some time in May and is dry all the rest of the time.  Pebbles, cobblestones, and larger stones make up 35 to 75 percent of the volume.  Base saturation is more than 75 percent throughout.  Organic matter is between 1 and 4 percent.\nThe A horizon when dry is dark gray, dark grayish brown, dark brown or grayish brown (10YR 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2).  When moist, it is very dark grayish brown, very dark brown or dark brown (10YR 3/2, 2/2, 3/3; 2.5Y 3/2; 7.5YR 3/2).  This horizon is sandy loam or loam with less than 18 percent clay and is modified by gravel, cobblestones, stone, and angular shale fragments.  It is neutral to moderately acid.\nIn pedons having B horizons or C horizons above the bedrock, the color, texture, and reaction are similar to the A horizon.  Some pedons have a few thin clay films accompanied by little or no clay increase."

Bakeoven, Lickskillet, and Rockly soils have more than 18 percent clay and a mean annual soil temperature of 47 degrees to 54 degrees F.  Godde and Virgin Peak soils have an aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.  Gamboa soils have a lithic contact below 40 inches.  Hambright and Lopez soils have thermic temperature.  McMullin soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments.  Permanente soils are mildly alkaline and have dry hue of 7.5YR or redder.  Venator soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 degrees to 49 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Plaskett soils are on steep and very steep side slopes at elevations of 1,800 to 4,200 feet.  They formed in residuum from fractured, slightly weathered sandstone, shale, and schist.  The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with a mean annual rainfall of 30 to 70 inches with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The average January temperature is about 40 degrees F., average July temperature is about 66 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.  Freeze-free season is 180 to 250 days."
