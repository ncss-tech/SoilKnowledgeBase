  "OVERVIEW": "The Puhimau series consists of very shallow and shallow, moderately well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash deposited over pahoehoe lava.  Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 2,489 millimeters (98 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C. (61 degrees F.)",
