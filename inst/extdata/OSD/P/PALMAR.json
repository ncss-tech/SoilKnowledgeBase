  "OVERVIEW": "The Palmar series consists of deep, poorly drained, moderately permeable soils formed in decomposed plant material.  These nearly level soils are on coastal plains and flood plains and are subject to frequent flooding.  Slopes ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 54 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 78 degrees F.",
