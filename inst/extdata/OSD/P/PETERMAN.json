  "OVERVIEW": "The Peterman series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in fine textured alluvium derived from mixed material. Peterman soils are on lower margins of alluvial fans, basin rim areas and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the calcic horizon of hard lime concretions and soft masses ranges from 5 to 30 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 65 degrees F. and the soil temperature is not below 47 degrees F. at any time.  The soil is usually dry and is not continuously moist for as long as 60 days. It is moderately to strongly saline-alkali.  Gypsum occurs in variable amounts in most pedons.  Clay in the control section ranges from about 45 to 55 percent.\nThe A horizon, or upper 10 inches, is very pale brown or pale brown (10YR 7/3, 6/3). It is loam, clay loam or clay. Structure is weak fine and moderate fine and medium subangular blocky. In some areas, the upper 1 or 2 inches is weak very thin or thin platy. Disseminated lime is strongly effervescent to violently effervescent. Reaction ranges from moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon is pale brown or very pale brown (10YR 6/3, 7/4). It has moderate or strong, medium or coarse subangular or angular blocky structure. Reaction ranges from moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline. The Cca horizon can be dug or augered without too much difficulty when moist, but can be intractable when dry. Segregated lime occurs in fine to large hard white irregular shaped concretions and soft masses which range in volume from 5 to 30 percent. The calcic horizon is typically about 36 inches thick but ranges from 24 to 50 inches. It has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 15 to 30 percent. The C horizons below the Cca horizon have at least 5 percent less disseminated and segregated lime than above horizons."

Some moisture falls occasionally as snow. Mean annual precipitation is 4 or 5 inches. Average January temperature is 46 degrees F.; average July temperature is 84 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 61 to 65 degrees F. Average frost-free season is 210 to 255 days."
