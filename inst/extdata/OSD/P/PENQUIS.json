  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock ranges from 51 to 102 cm and solum thickness ranges from 46 to 76 cm. It is silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. The weighted average of clay is 4 to 10 percent and that of silt is greater than 55 percent in the particle-size control section. Rock fragments are predominantly channers and cobbles with a few stones and range from 5 to 35 percent throughout the soil. Fragments that can easily be crushed to silt and very fine sand are common. Stones cover up to 3 percent of the surface. Reaction in unlimed areas is very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum and strongly acid or moderately acid in the substratum.\nThe O horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, with value of chroma of 3 or 4. It dominantly has granular structure and is very friable or friable.\nThe E horizon, where present, has a hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. It has weak very fine granular or weak very thin or thin platy structure. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bhs horizon, where present, has a hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, with a value of 2.5 or 3 and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. It has granular or subangular blocky structure and is very friable or friable.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It has granular or subangular blocky structure and is very friable or friable.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It has platy or massive structure. It is friable or firm.\nThe R layer is phyllite, calcareous metasiltstone and metasandstone, or metalimestone."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bangor, Berkshire, Dekapen, Elliottsville, Groveton, Houghtonville, Potsdam, Revel, Tunbridge and Welcome series in the same family. The Bangor, Berkshire, Groveton, Houghtonville, and Potsdam soils are more than 102 cm deep to bedrock. Revel and Welcome soils have a xeric moisture regime. In addition, Dekapen soils are moderately deep over basal till, Revel soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact and Welcome soils are deep to a paralithic contact. Elliottsville soils have less crushable rock fragments throughout. Tunbridge soils have less silt and less crushable rock fragments throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Penquis soils are on glacial till knolls and ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. The soils formed in a moderately deep mantle of glacial till derived principally from phyllite, calcareous metasiltstone and metasandstone, and metalimestone. The climate is humid and cool temperate. Mean annual temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C and mean annual precipitation ranges from 991 to 1168 mm. The frost-free season ranges from 100 to 140 days. Elevations range from 91 to 671 meters above mean sea level."

Abram and Thorndike soils are shallower to bedrock and are on higher knolls within the landscape. Bangor and Plaisted soils are in deeper pockets in the bedrock. Dixmont and Howland soils are more than 40 inches to bedrock and are located in positions down slope that receive runoff. Monarda soils are more than 40 inches to bedrock, poorly drained and located in concave positions below the bedrock controlled knolls. Winnecook soils are on similar positions but have more rock fragments."
