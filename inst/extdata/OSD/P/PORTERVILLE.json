  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist, but are dry for 60 consecutive days in most years.  The mean annual soil temperature is 60 to 72 degrees F.  Slickensides are common to many in the lower A and C horizons.  Slope of the faces of the slickensides tends to decrease with depth.  The soil s may be gravelly or cobbly with most of the gravel or cobbles concentrated on the surface.  Rock fragments may cover as much as 45 percent of the surface.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline and increases with increasing depth.\nThe A horizon is dark grayish brown, brown, dark brown, dark reddish brown, reddish brown and dark reddish gray in 10YR, 7.5YR and 5YR hues.  It is clay or heavy clay loam and has weak to strong, angular or subangular blocky structure.  The surface few inches is often granular and of such fineness and looseness as to form a dry bog condition.\nThe C horizon is brown,dark brown, light brown, dark reddish brown, reddish brown, yellowish red, dark reddish gray, and reddish gray in 7.5YR and 5YR hues.  It is clay or silty clay loam.  Lime is disseminated or occurs as mycelia, soft masses or hard nodules and is restricted to the lower part of the A and C horizons.\nThe soils may overlie lithologic discontinuities such as bedrock at depths below 60 inches, or coarser textured alluvium at depths below 4 feet."

Alo and Centerville soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 24 to 40 inches.  Altamont and Ault soils have slopes of more than 9 percent.  Capay soils have grayish colors in 10YR and 2.5Y hues throughout the profile.  Cibo soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Seville soils have a duripan at depths of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Porterville soils are on alluvial fans and foothills with slopes of 0 to 9 percent.  They formed in fine textured alluvium from basic and metabasic rocks.  Elevations range are less than 2,000 feet in the lower valleys and 4,00 to 4,500 feet in the higher valleys.  The climate is semiarid, mesothermal, having cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 20 inches.  The average January temperature is about 45 degrees F.; the average July temperature is about 79 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F.  The frost free season is about 220 to 300 days in the low valleys and 150 to 225 days in the high valleys."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for range pasture.  Vegetation is annual grasses, burclove, herbs and widely spaced shrubs.  Most cultivated areas are irrigated and planted to oranges, lemons, olives, figs and some grapes.  Other areas are used for dry farmed hay and grain or as rangeland.  Much of the Porterville soils occur in thermal belts near the foothills making them highly valued for the production of subtropical fruits."
