  "OVERVIEW": "The Pustoi series consists of shallow stratified silty and sandy materials over a thick-sandy substratum. All the soil material is of volcanic origin. The soils occupy steep side slopes of deep narrow valleys, stream terraces, and dunes; slopes range from nearly level to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation ranges from about 20 to 65 inches, and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 33 degrees to 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the sandy substratum ranges from 4 to 20 inches. There is considerable variation in the thickness and arrangement of strata in the upper part of the soil. The substratum may contain up to 35 percent (by volume) of cinders. Soil colors in the upper part of the pedon are in hues of 10YR to 5YR, with values of 2 or 3 and chromas of 1 or 2. In the substratum they are in hues of 10YR to 2.5Y, with values of 2 to 5 and chromas of 1 or 2. A few thin silty lenses may occur in the substratum. The underlying material is basaltic rock or glacial till."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Umnak series of the same family and the Aslik, Kizhuvak, Kvichak, Okmok, and Tulik series. The Umnak soils are stratified throughout the pedon, with many layers of thixotropic materials. The Aslik soils have cindery substrata. The Kizhuyak soils are stratified sandy and silty ash with color values of 4 or higher and with mottling at depth. The Kvichak soils have thixotropic upper horizons. The Okmok soils are cindery and have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. The Tulik soils are stratified and consist dominantly of thixotropic materials."

They are formed in waterworked and windlaid materials of volcanic origin. The climate is maritime, with cool summers and mild winters. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 65 inches. The mean-annual temperature ranges from 33 degrees to 42 degrees F."
