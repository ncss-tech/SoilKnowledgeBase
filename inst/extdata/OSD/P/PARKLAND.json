  "OVERVIEW": "The Parkland series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary sources including sandstone and mudstone. Parkland soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans in mountain river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2160 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 14 degrees C.",

Argillic horizon - the zone from 10 to 180 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and Bt5 horizons).\n3. Oxyaquic conditions - the zone from 70 to 180 centimeters (Bt4 and Bt5 horizons)\n4. Redoximorphic concentrations in the surface due to compaction, are common in these soils and do not indicate presence of a water table.\n5. Particle size control section - 10 to 60 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons) averages 29 percent clay and 16 percent fine sand or coarser, by weight, and 4 percent rock fragments."
