  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Parkland soils are on stream terraces or alluvial fans in mountain river valleys. Slopes are 0 to 9 percent. Elevations are 35 to 140 meters. These soils formed in slope alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary sources including sandstone and mudstone. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers with a marine layer influence and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1525 to 3050 millimeters. Mean annual temperature is 13 to 15 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 280 days."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 117 centimeters (Ap, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4 horizons).\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 10 to 180 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and Bt5 horizons).\n3. Oxyaquic conditions - the zone from 70 to 180 centimeters (Bt4 and Bt5 horizons)\n4. Redoximorphic concentrations in the surface due to compaction, are common in these soils and do not indicate presence of a water table.\n5. Particle size control section - 10 to 60 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons) averages 29 percent clay and 16 percent fine sand or coarser, by weight, and 4 percent rock fragments.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NASIS User Pedon ID: 03CA601153\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy, 12th edition\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
