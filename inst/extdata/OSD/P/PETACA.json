The soils formed in material derived from basalt and other materials. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F. and the summer temperature is about 68 degrees F. There are no climatic stations that can directly be related to the climate of Petaca soils."
