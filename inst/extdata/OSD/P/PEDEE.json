  "OVERVIEW": "The Pedee series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed mainly in colluvium from metasedimentary rocks and have loess material in the upper part. Pedee soils are on dissected terraces and have slopes of 3 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.",
