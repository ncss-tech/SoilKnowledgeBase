  "OVERVIEW": "The Paige series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over till derived from volcanic rock. The Paige soils are on moraines.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1372 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
