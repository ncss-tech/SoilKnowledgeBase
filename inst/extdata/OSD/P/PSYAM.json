    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Psyam soils are on level to gently sloping toeslopes and valley floors in narrow valleys of the Ouachita Mountains.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium deposition from nearby hillsides which was deposited on top of predominately tilted, fractured, and folded shale bedrock .  In some pedons, a paleosol is present.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 41 to 56 inches with the highes amount being distributed in January to May.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 64 degrees F."
