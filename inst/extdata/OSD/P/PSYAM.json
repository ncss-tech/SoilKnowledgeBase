  "REVDATE": "03/2000",
  "STATES": "AR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Psyam series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy coluvial sediments from shale, siltstone and sandstone deposited on shale dominately of Pennsylvanian age. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on valley floors and toeslopes in narrow valleys of the Ouachita Mountains; MLRA 119.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.",
