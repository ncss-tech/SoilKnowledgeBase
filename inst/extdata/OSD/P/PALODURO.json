  "OVERVIEW": "The Paloduro series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy alluvium and colluvium derived from the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping alluvial fans or valley flats and moderately to strongly sloping valley sides.  Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 496 mm, and mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C.",
