  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 15 to 22 inches thick.  Depth to the duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches, and depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Mean annual soil temperature is 49 degrees to 54 degrees F. The profile contains 0 to 3 percent stones and 0 to 15 percent gravel in the textural control section. Vertical cracks, 2 to 3 inches wide at the surface, extent to the duripan. This cracking is concentrated between polygons which are 10 to 12 inches across.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 3 or 4 moist.\nThe AC horizon is silty clay or clay.\nThe C horizon above the duripan has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. Darker soil material has accumulated in the cracks between peds in most profiles due to the churning nature of the soil. Textures are clay, heavy clay loam or silty clay. The C material below the pan ranges from fine gravelly loamy sand to gravelly loam.  Percent stones range from 0 to 10 percent, and percent gravel ranges from 10 to 25 percent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aikman, Jenny, Lassen and Montague series. Aikman and Lassen soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Jenny soils lack bedrock and a duripan above 60 inches.  Montague soils have a bedrock or petrocalcic horizon at depths of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Peasley soils are on basalt which have received a veneer of granitic alluvium and loess. Elevations range from 2,800 to 3,500 feet. Slopes are 2 to 6 percent. The soils formed in residuum weathered from basalt with a strong influence of granitic alluvium and loess. The climate is middle-latitude steppe (Trewartha's modified Koppen system), with cool moist winters and dry summers. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 15 inches. Mean January temperature is about 27 degrees F.; mean July temperature is about 70 degrees F.; the mean annual temperature is 47 degrees to 52 degrees F. Frost-free period is about 140 to 160 days."

Chilcott and Kunaton soils do not have slickensides and vertical cracks which extend from the surface to a depth of more than 20 inches. Sebree soils have a natric horizon and have less than 35 percent clay in the textural control section."
