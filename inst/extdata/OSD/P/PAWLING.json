  "STATES": "NY,VT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pawling series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, soils formed in alluvium.  They are on nearly level flood plain. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately rapid to rapid in the underlying substratum. Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 39 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 45 inches, and the depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent, by volume, in the solum and 15 to 70 percent in the substratum. Unless limed, reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid above 20 inches and moderately acid to neutral in the lower part of the solum and substratum.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam or loam. It has weak or moderate, medium or fine granular structure. Consistence is friable or very friable. Thickness of the A horizon ranges from 2 to 5 inches.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 3 or 4.  Redoximorphic features with hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or 10YR, values of 4 to 7, chroma of 1 to 3 are present in the lower part.  Textures are silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam. They have weak or moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky or granular structure, perhaps parting from prismatic. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 1 to 3.  Redoximorphic features with colors like the B are in some pedons. Textures are sand or loamy sand in the fine earth fraction. It is massive or single grain. Consistence is very friable or loose."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.\nThe Basher, Middlebury, Philo, and Podunk are similar soils in related families. All of these soils lack sandy or sandy-skeletal textures within a depth of 40 inches. In addition, Basher, Philo, and Podunk soils have less than 60 percent base saturation within a depth of 30 inches. Basher soils are redder than 7.5YR in the upper part of the B horizons."

They formed in loamy alluvium washed from upland soils formed mainly from till derived from shale, siltstone and slate rocks. Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 52 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches, and the frost-free season ranges from 120 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 50 to 1500 feet above sea level."

Amenia, Cambridge, Georgia, Messena, Pittsfield, Stockbridge, and Valois soils are in nearby till deposits.  Riverhead and Chenango soils are adjacent on higher terraces. Well drained Wappinger soils form a drainage sequence with Pawling soils."
