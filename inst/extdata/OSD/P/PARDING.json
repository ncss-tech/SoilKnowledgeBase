  "OVERVIEW": "The Parding series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess and slope alluvium from limestone.  These soils are on hillsides and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 5 to 40 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
