    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonate ranges from 20 to 36 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 30 inches thick and extends into the Bt horizon.  The soil contains 0 to 10 percent rock fragments by volume throughout.  Some pedons have stones throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is loam but is silt loam in some pedons.  It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is clay loam but is silty clay loam in some pedons.  Some pedons have thin horizons that exceed 35 percent clay, but the weighted average is between 27 and 35 percent clay.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk, Bk, and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  These horizons are loam or clay loam and are slightly or moderately alkaline.  Carbonate is both disseminated and accumulated in the Btk, Bk, and C horizons. Gypsum crystals and other salts are below depths of 40 inches in some pedons."

The well drained Albinas soils do not have redox features within depths of 40 inches.  Garrett soils are redder with hues of 5YR through 10R. Haxtun soils do not have redox features within depths of 40 inches and typically have buried horizons within 25 inches.  Jarita soils have limestone bedrock at depths between 20 and 40 inches and have argillic horizons with hues of 7.5YR or redder.  Keya and Renner soils have carbonate at depths more than 36 inches.  Sampson soils do not have low chroma redox features within a depth of 40 inches, and have more than 50 percent sand in the C horizon within depths of 40 inches.  Tracylee and Wetterdon soils do not have carbonates and low chroma redox features within a depth of 40 inches.  Vosburg soils do not have low chroma redox features within a depth of 40 inches and have a drier soil moisture control section. Woodly soils contain 18 to 27 percent clay in the series control section.  Woonsocket soils contain 55 to 80 percent fine sand or coarser in the particle size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are level and gently sloping on uplands.  Slope gradients typically are 0 to 2 percent but range from about 0 to 6 percent.  Surfaces typically are plane or slightly concave. These soils formed in loam or clay loam glacial till.  The till commonly is mantled with local alluvium 1 to 3 feet thick.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F, and precipitation ranges from 17 to 26 inches.  Growing season is about 130 to 165 days; average growing season precipitation is 13 to 20 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 3500."

Clarno, Houdek, and Ethan soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick and are on the higher parts of the landscapes.  The Crossplain soils are in more depressed swales and drainageways and have a fine textured series control section.  Davison soils have a calcic horizon within 16 inches and are on slightly higher positions adjacent to swales. Dudley and Stickney soils have a natric horizon and are on the nearly level landscapes with microrelief.  Tetonka soils are in shallow depressions, have a fine textured series control section, and have an E horizon."
