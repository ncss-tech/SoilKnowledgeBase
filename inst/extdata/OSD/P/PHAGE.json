  "OVERVIEW": "The Phage series consists of very deep, well or somewhat excessively drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary and basic intermediate igneous rocks. These soils are on fan terraces, stream terraces, rolling hills, and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 1 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
