    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes are dominantly 3 to 30 percent and range from 1 to 70 percent. The soils formed in alluvium from intermediate igneous and sedimentary rocks. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 14 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."

Ushar soils have Bw horizons and do not have rock fragments in the control section. Black Ridge soils are fine textured and have a petrocalcic horizon. Red Butte soils have an argillic horizon and have less than 50 percent rock fragments in the control section. Pass Canyon soils have argillic horizons and shallow over bedrock."

Principal irrigated crops grown are alfalfa and small grains."
