  "OVERVIEW": "The Phiferson series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum, alluvium or eolian deposits derived from calcareous sandstone.  Phiferson soils are on nearly level to steep hillslopes benches and terraces. The mean annual precipitation is about 33 centimeters (13 inches).  The mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F.) at the type location.",
