They formed in calcareous silty and clayey glaciolacustrine sediments with very minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface.  Elevations range from 2,000 to 2,400 feet.  The climate is subhumid with cold wet winters and warm relatively dry summers.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 25 to 30 inches.  The average frost-free period is from 100 to 135 days."
