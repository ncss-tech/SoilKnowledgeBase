  "OVERVIEW": "The Porthill series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on terraces.  They formed in calcareous silty and clayey glaciolacustrine sediments with very minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface layer.  Permeability is slow.  Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is about 30 inches.",
