These soils formed in loamy alluvium derived mainly from tuffs, basalt, and andesite with a small admixture of limestone and quartzite. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1.280 to 1,890 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm dry summers.   The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C, and the average frost-free season is 130 to 150 days."
