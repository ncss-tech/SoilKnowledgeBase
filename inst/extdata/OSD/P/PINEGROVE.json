  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid except for surface layers that have been\nreclaimed.  Fragments of medium and coarse-grained sandstone typically have weak coherence and weather rapidly.  They are\nless than 35 percent by volume to a depth of 40 inches, but\nrange up to 60 percent below 40 inches.  They are mostly in the\n2 mm. to 25 cm. range but also include stones and boulders.\nIn unreclaimed areas (or areas reclaimed without addition of\ntopsoil) the A or Ap horizon is sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse\nsand, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam.  It has hue of 7.5YR,\n10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 6.  Areas reclaimed with addition of a blanket of \"topsoil\" have an Ap\nhorizon as much as 10 inches thick of loam, silt loam, or silty\nclay loam; and up to 15 percent rock fragments.  It has hue of\n2.5YR to 5Y, or is neutral; value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to\n8.\nIndividual layers of the C horizon commonly are loamy sand,\nloamy coarse sand, sand, or coarse sand; or channery or gravelly analogues of these textures; but very gravelly or very channery analogues of these textures are in some subhorizons below 40\ninches, and thin subhorizons of finer textures are in some\npedons.  Clay content ranges from 2 to 12 percent.  Colors in\nthe C horizon have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y; value of 3 to 6; and\nchroma of 2 to 8."

All of the soils\nin the same family except Chute, Oakville, Plainfield, and\nWestport formed in fluvial sediments and are stratified.  Chute\nand Westport soils formed in aeolian sand deposits and lack\ncoarse fragments.  Oakville and Plainfield soils formed in sandy sediments or drift and do not have fragments of sandstone from surface mine operations.  Barkcamp, Bethesda, Itmann, and Sewell soils also formed in regolith from surface mine operations but\nare loamy-skeletal.  In addition Barkcamp soils are ultra acid (reaction of 3.5 or less); and Bethesda and Itmann soils have textures finer than loamy fine sand in the fine earth fraction\nof the control section."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pinegrove soils are on nearly level\nridgetops and benches to very steep side slopes.  They formed in\nacid regolith from surface mine operations.  Rock fragments are mostly medium and coarse-grained sandstone with lesser amounts\nof fine-grained sandstone, siltstone, shale, and coal.  Slopes\nrange from 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges\nfrom about 39 to 43 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges\nfrom about 51 to 56 degrees F."

Gilpin and Lily soils have fine-loamy argillic horizons, but Steinsburg soils have\ncoarse-loamy cambic horizons.  Gilpin soils formed in residuum\nfrom interbedded siltstone, shale and sandstone, whereas Lily\nand Steinsburg soils formed in residuum from sandstone.   Upshur soils have fine-textured argillic horizons and formed in\nresiduum mainly from clay shale."
