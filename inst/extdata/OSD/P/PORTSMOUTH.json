This revision changes the classification to fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and moves the type location from Virginia to North Carolina.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 12 inches (the Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from a depth of 23 to a depth of 35 inches. (the Btg horizon)\nAquic moisture regime\nStrongly contrasting particle-size class - below a depth of 38 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5   Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp  FrFr/Seas   Precip  Elevation\nNC0128  PORTSMOUTH  0-2    58-70     200-260    42-56    5-100\nSOI-5    FloodL  FloodH   Watertable   Kind      Months    Bedrock\nNC0128    NONE    RARE      0-1.0     APPARENT   NOV-MAY    >60\nSOI-5   Depth   Texture              3-Inch  No-10   Clay%   -CEC-\nNC0128   0-19   MK-SL MK-FSL MK-L     0-0    98-100  10-25   10-20\nNC0128   0-19   SL FSL L              0-0    98-100   5-25    4-13\nNC0128   0-19   SIL MK-SIL            0-0    90-100  20-27    7-20\nNC0128  19-35   L SCL CL              0-0    98-100  20-35    5-9\nNC0128  35-38   LS SL                 0-0    98-100   8-18    1-4\nNC0128  38-72   SR COS LS             0-0    98-100   2-10    0-3\nSOI-5     Depth    -pH-      O.M.
