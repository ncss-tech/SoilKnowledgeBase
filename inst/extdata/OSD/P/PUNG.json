    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:   Pung soils are on side slopes and summit areas of terraces at elevations of 1,830 to 2,135 meters.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from tertiary sediments.  The summers are hot and dry and the winters are cold and wet.  Precipitation is mostly snow in winter months and rain in spring months. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 cm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C; and the frost-free season is 90 to ll0 days."
