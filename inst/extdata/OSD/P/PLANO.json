  "OVERVIEW": "The Plano series consists of very deep, well drained soils on outwash plains, stream terraces, or till plains. These soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy stratified outwash or sandy loam till. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches).",

Douglas and Parkway soils have in the lowest one-quarter of the series control section a narrower range in sand content with no subhorizon exceeding 45 percent sand nor exceeding 15 percent gravel. Elkhart, Osco, Tama, and Wakenda soils have in the lowest one-quarter of the series control section an average sand content of less than 25 percent. Healing soils average more than 1 percent coarse fragments of chert in the upper part of the series control section. Malcolm soils have the base of the argillic horizon within a depth of 112 cm (44 inches). Mickle soils average 18 to 30 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Ogle soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the lower part of the series control section. Sibley soils have mollic epipedons greater than 51 cm (20 inches) thick."

The moderately well drained Catlin and Dana soils are on adjacent moraines. Proctor soils are on similar nearby parts of the landscape where the mantle of loess is thinner. The somewhat poorly drained Brenton and Elburn soils and the poorly drained Drummer and Thorp soils are on lower parts of the landscape. Elburn and Drummer soils form a drainage sequence with Plano soils in areas underlain by loamy outwash."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the solum and moderately high and high (4.23 to 42.34 micrometers per second) in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderate to moderately rapid in the underlying material.
