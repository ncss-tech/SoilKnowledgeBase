Ashdale, Elmont, and Ripon soils have sola terminated by bedrock within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Broadwell, Richwood, and Toddville soils have in the lowest one-quarter of the series control section an average sand content of greater than 80 percent. Dinsdale, Lycurgus, Meadowbank, Mendota, Proctor, Sidell, Tecumseh, and Waupecan soils have horizons with more than 10 percent sand within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Douglas and Parkway soils have in the lowest one-quarter of the series control section a narrower range in sand content with no subhorizon exceeding 45 percent sand nor exceeding 15 percent gravel. Elkhart, Osco, Tama, and Wakenda soils have in the lowest one-quarter of the series control section an average sand content of less than 25 percent. Healing soils average more than 1 percent coarse fragments of chert in the upper part of the series control section. Malcolm soils have the base of the argillic horizon within a depth of 112 cm (44 inches). Mickle soils average 18 to 30 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Ogle soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the lower part of the series control section. Sibley soils have mollic epipedons greater than 51 cm (20 inches) thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Plano soils are on outwash plains or stream terraces. Slope gradients commonly are 0 to 5 percent but some are as steep as 12 percent. The soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess or other silty material and the underlying loamy stratified outwash or sandy loam till. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.8 to 12.2 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 740 to 990 mm (29 to 39 inches), frost-free period ranges from 160 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 207 to 311 meters (680 to 1020 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Proctor soils and the Brenton, Catlin, Dana, Drummer, Elburn, and Thorp soils. The moderately well drained Catlin and Dana soils are on adjacent moraines. Proctor soils are on similar nearby parts of the landscape where the mantle of loess is thinner. The somewhat poorly drained Brenton and Elburn soils and the poorly drained Drummer and Thorp soils are on lower parts of the landscape. Elburn and Drummer soils form a drainage sequence with Plano soils in areas underlain by loamy outwash."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Plano soils are well drained. The potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the solum and moderately high and high (4.23 to 42.34 micrometers per second) in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderate to moderately rapid in the underlying material. Very rarely flooded or rarely flooded phases of these soils that occur on stream terraces are recognized."
