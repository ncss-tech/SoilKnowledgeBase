  "OVERVIEW": "The Pilot Rock series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in loess over a very gravelly duripan.  Pilot Rock soils are on fan terraces with slopes of 1 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days between 4 and 12 inches within the three-month period following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section is silt loam with 10 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is weak or moderate platy and granular or weak fine subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is weak fine, medium or coarse prismatic or medium or coarse subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and dry.  It is moderately to strongly alkaline.\nThe duripan is indurated in the upper 1 to 5 inches and is weakly to strongly cemented below.  It grades to loose very or extremely gravelly sand many feet thick."
