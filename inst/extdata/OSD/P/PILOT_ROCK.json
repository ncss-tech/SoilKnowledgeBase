    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the duripan is 20 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  These soils are usually moist but are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days between 4 and 12 inches within the three-month period following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section is silt loam with 10 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is weak or moderate platy and granular or weak fine subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is weak fine, medium or coarse prismatic or medium or coarse subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and dry.  It is moderately to strongly alkaline.\nThe duripan is indurated in the upper 1 to 5 inches and is weakly to strongly cemented below.  It grades to loose very or extremely gravelly sand many feet thick."
