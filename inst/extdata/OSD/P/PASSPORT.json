Some pedons have an A horizon less than 6 inches thick with color value of 3. Clay content ranges from 15 to 35 percent and content of fine sand or coarser ranges from 10 to 35 percent. Texture is commonly silt loam, but severely eroded pedons may be silty clay loam or clay loam. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral. Content of rock fragments is less than 1 percent. Some pedons have AB, BA, or E horizons.\nThe Bt or Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. Clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent and content of fine sand or coarser ranges from 12 to 35 percent. Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, or loam.

Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bt or 2Btg horizon has hue to 10YR, or less commonly 2.5Y or 7.5YR, value 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8. Clay content ranges from 25 to 45 percent and content of fine sand or coarser ranges from 15 to 40 percent. Texture is dominantly clay loam but the range includes loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or silt loam. Content of rock fragments ranges from 1 to 5 percent. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Btgb, 2BCb, 2C, or 2Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, 2.5Y, and less commonly 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 8. Clay content ranges from 15 to 37 percent and content of fine sand or coarser ranges from 20 to 40 percent. Texture is clay loam or loam. Content of rock fragments ranges from 1 to 10 percent.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Passport soils are on dissected parts of the Illinoian till plain. Slopes range from 2 to 18 percent. They formed in 20 to 45 inches of loamy materials and in the underlying Illinoian till that contains a strongly developed paleosol (Sangamon paleosol). The loamy materials are in a stratigraphic position between the Wisconsinan age Peoria loess and the underlying Sangamon paleosol. They consist of a mixture of Peoria loess, Roxana Silts, pedisediments, and till. Not all components of this mixture are present in all pedons. The mixing mechanism is believed to be the result of pedoturbation, bioturbation, or some other mixing process. Some pedons have a loess cap that is less than 10 inches thick. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 42 inches, mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F, frost free period ranges from 180 to 200 days, and elevation ranges from 340 to 1,020 feet above sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Atlas, Ava, Bluford, Darmstadt, Grantfork, Hickory, and Hoyleton soils. Atlas soils formed mostly in the strongly weathered paleosol in the till and are down slope from Passport soils. Ava, Bluford, Darmstadt, and Hoyleton soils are upslope from Passport soils where the loess is thicker. The moderately well drained Ava soils have a Bx horizon. Bluford and Hoyleton soils contain more clay in the control section. Darmstadt soils have a natric horizon. Grantfork soils have 10 to 15 percent exchangeable sodium in the subsoil. The well drained Hickory soils formed in till and are downslope from Passport soils."

Permeability is moderately slow in the loamy materials and slow in the till. An intermittent apparent seasonal high water table is present at a depth of 1 to 2 feet below the surface at some time between November and May in most years."

    "content": "REMARKS: Passport is the name of a small village in southwestern Richland County, Illinois.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 4 inches (Ap horizon);\nargillic horizon - the zone from 4 to 78 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btg1, Btg2, 2Btg3, 2Btg4, 2Btg5 and 2Btg6 horizons);\nudic moisture regime;\nmesic temperature regime.\nIn some parts of western Illinois, Passport series have been correlated which include pedons formed in loamy materials and in the underlying Cretaceous materials that contain a paleosol. Due to small acreage, these soils have been correlated as Passport series. The properties of the paleosol formed in the Cretaceous materials are nearly identical to the properties of the Sangamon paleosol formed in Illinoian till.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Particle-size data are on file for several pedons including the typical pedon at the Illinois state office and at the NSSL.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
