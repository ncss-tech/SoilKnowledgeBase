  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a paralithic contact is 25 to 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is about 60 degrees F. to 65 degrees F. and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F. at any time. Soil between depths of about 6 and 20 inches usually is dry all the time from April until early December and usually is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year. Rock fragments, mostly smaller than 3 inches, usually make up 3 to 6 percent of all horizons and may be as much as 35 percent. The soil has some angular and subangular coarse and very coarse sand and has a \"gritty\" feel.\nThe A horizon is light gray, light brownish gray, pale brown, grayish brown or brown. It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam. Organic matter averages less than 1 percent in the upper 10 inches. This horizon is neutral to medium acid. The A-B2t horizon boundary is abrupt and the B2t horizon has 15 to 20 percent more clay (absolute) than the A horizon. Some pedons have a thin A2 horizon and some do not.\nThe B2t horizon is brown, strong brown, yellowish brown or light brown and the hue is lOYR or 7.5YR. It is clay loam, sandy clay or clay with an average of 35 to about 45 percent clay. This horizon has moderate or strong prismatic or angular blocky structure. It is medium to very strongly acid and has 40 to 75 percent base saturation. Commonly a few cobblestones are present."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Auberry, Chualar, Cometa, Olivenhain, Placentia, Snelling, Spreckels, and Sutherlin series. Auberry, Chualar and Snelling soils have less than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Chualar soils have mollic epipedons. Snelling soils lack a paralithic contact and the base saturation is more than 75 percent. Olivenhain soils have 5YR or 2.5YR hue in the argillic horizon and have more than 35 percent rock fragments. Placentia soils have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium in the argillic horizon. Spreckels and Sutherlin soils have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 59 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pinnacles soils are strongly sloping to very steep at elevations of 1,000 to 3,000 feet. They formed in residuum weathered from sandstone, tuffaceous and arkosic consolidated sediments. The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm to hot, rainless summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is about 10 to 16 inches. The average January temperature is about 44 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 77 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F. to 62 degrees F. The freeze-free season is about 230 to 250 days."

McCoy soils have a mollic epipedon and the argillic horizon has less than 35 percent clay. Santa Lucia and Sheridan soils have mollic epipedons and lack argillic horizons. Vista soils have a cambic horizon and lack an argillic horizon."
