The well drained Guelph and the somewhat poorly drained Shebeon soils are in a drainage sequence with Parkhill soils. They are the common associates in the northern part of the range of the Parkhill series. The moderately well drained Miami and the somewhat poorly drained Crosier soils are common associates in the southern part of the range. The poorly drained Corunna soils are on similar landform positions and have less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section. The somewhat poorly drained Avoca, Poseyville, and Selfridge soils are on low knolls and  have sandy materials in the upper part of the subsoil."

Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 cm above the surface to 25 cm below the surface between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the surface, moderately low in the subsoil and upper substratum, and very low in the dense substratum."
