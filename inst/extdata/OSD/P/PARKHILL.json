  "OVERVIEW": "The Parkhill series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils that are deep to dense till. These soils formed in loamy till overlying loamy dense till. They are on wave-worked till plains, till plains, water-lain moraines, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 820 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

They are the common associates in the northern part of the range of the Parkhill series. The moderately well drained Miami and the somewhat poorly drained Crosier soils are common associates in the southern part of the range. The poorly drained Corunna soils are on similar landform positions and have less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section. The somewhat poorly drained Avoca, Poseyville, and Selfridge soils are on low knolls and  have sandy materials in the upper part of the subsoil."
