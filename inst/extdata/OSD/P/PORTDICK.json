    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 39 to 41 degrees F. Thickness of the loamy surface mantle ranges from 20 to 35 inches over sand and gravel. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.   The pH of the solum ranges from 5.8 to 6.8.  The pH of the substratum increases with depth and ranges from 6.5 to 7.6.\nThe A horizon textures of silt loam and very fine sandy loam have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Thin strata of fine sandy loam, sand, and loamy sand have variegated colors.\nThe 2C horizons have variegated colors if the texture is sand.  They have hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3 if the texture is loamy sand.  They are very gravelly or extremely gravelly sand or loamy sand.  Rock fragments range from 40 to 70 percent and include 35 to 70 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobble."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Portdick soils are formed in stratified loamy sediments over sand and gravel deposits on alluvial plains and low terraces.  In some areas recent tectonic activity has dropped these landforms several feet.  The lowest of these subsided areas are affected by saltwater intrusion.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Elevations are 20 to 150 feet.\nThe climate is maritime with mild winters and cool summers.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 65 to 75 inches and the mean annual snowfall is 50 to 100 inches.  Mean January temperature is 26 degrees F., mean July temperature is 55  degrees F., and the mean annual temperature ranges from 38  to 40 degrees F."

Chenega soils have a particle size control section that is sandy-skeletal and are on floodplains and alluvial fans.  Jakolof soils have spodic horizons and are on stream terraces and alluvial fans. Petrof soils occur in complex with Portdick soils."
