  "OVERVIEW": "The Parguera series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on toe slopes and alluvial fans of Semiarid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  They formed in clayey and loamy fluvial sediments that weathered from limestone.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 80 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",
