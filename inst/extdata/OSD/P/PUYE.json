  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Puye consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from pumice.  They occupy dissected mesa summits.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 to 14 inches, mean annual temperature is about 46 to 48 degrees F, and the frost-free period is about 135 to 145 days.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent and elevations range from 6,300 to 7,200 feet."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:In October 2000, taxonomic classification was converted to the closest match found in Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition 1999.  Some update was made to horizon nomenclature, competing series section, etc.  Other placements may be more appropriate after a complete update.\nThis soil was originally classified as typic because the Ustic subgroup did not exist.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 3 inches. ( A horizon)\nDuripan - The indurated layer beneath the A and Bw horizon that has been cemented dominantly by silica. (Bkqm)\nUstic feature - soil does not have a xeric moisture regime.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Partial data from the type location NSSL No. 87P0093.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
