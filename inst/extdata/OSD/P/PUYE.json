  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:In October 2000, taxonomic classification was converted to the closest match found in Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition 1999.  Some update was made to horizon nomenclature, competing series section, etc.  Other placements may be more appropriate after a complete update.\nThis soil was originally classified as typic because the Ustic subgroup did not exist.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 3 inches. ( A horizon)\nDuripan - The indurated layer beneath the A and Bw horizon that has been cemented dominantly by silica. (Bkqm)\nUstic feature - soil does not have a xeric moisture regime.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Partial data from the type location NSSL No. 87P0093.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
