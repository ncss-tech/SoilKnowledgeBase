  "OVERVIEW": "The Peninsula series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on high valley benches or terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from mixed sources, mainly shale, loess, and volcanic material.  Slopes range from 3 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

They occupy steeper and generally sun-facing slopes at somewhat lower elevation and have a mesic soil temperature regime.  Empedrado, Fughes, Hesperus, and Zoltay soils are at somewhat higher elevations where they receive 16 to 20 or more inches precipitation.  None of these soils have calcic horizons and, the Empedrado soils have mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of approximately 10 inches (Ap, Bt1 horizons);\nArgillic horizon - the zone from approximately 4 to 28 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Btk horizons);\nCalcic feature - the zone from approximately 28 to 53 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizons;\nBorolls feature - inferred from susceptibility to frost in any month except July, inability to grow corn for grain, and certainty of only two cuttings of alfalfa.  Nearest climatic station, at the lower elevation range of the series, shows a mean annual air temperature of 45.6 degrees F.  Most of the Peninsula soil is north-sloping.\nThe other diagnostically similar series do not have the June precipitation minima, and therefore do not behave similarly under use and management for rangeland or for irrigation requirements.\nLast updated by the state 6/95.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
