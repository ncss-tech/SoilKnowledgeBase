    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick and extends into the Bt2 horizon in some pedons.  Epipedons which are less than 10 inches thick extend to at least one-third of the depth to the calcic horizon.  Depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 16 to 33 inches.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 20 to 60 percent in individual horizons.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent in the solum and Ck or C horizons, if present.  Fragments are mostly basalt and range in size from pebble to stone.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5R, value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR and some pedons have hue of 10YR in the upper part.  They have value of 4 through 6 dry, and 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.  The upper part of some pedons have chroma of 3.  Texture is clay loam or silty clay loam, with clay content between 35 and 40 percent.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry and 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Texture is clay loam or silty clay loam with between 32 and 38 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 7 or 8 dry, and 6 or 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam, with clay content between 24 and 32 percent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon, if present, has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR.  Textures range from silty clay loam to loam, with between 24 and 32 percent clay content.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent basaltic pebbles, cobbles, and stone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Peninsula soils are on high valley benches or terraces.  Relief is variable and slopes range from 3 to 12 percent.  The soils formed in alluvial material from mixed shale, loessial, and volcanic sources.  Elevation ranges from 6,200 to 6,800 feet.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 19 inches, and is distributed throughout the year, but with a low in June, and with about 30 percent falling in the months of August through October.  The frost-free period is 85 to 110 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Clapper, Empedrado, Fughes, and Hesperus soils.  Clapper soils lack both a mollic epipedon and an argillic horizon.  They occupy steeper and generally sun-facing slopes at somewhat lower elevation and have a mesic soil temperature regime.  Empedrado, Fughes, Hesperus, and Zoltay soils are at somewhat higher elevations where they receive 16 to 20 or more inches precipitation.  None of these soils have calcic horizons and, the Empedrado soils have mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of approximately 10 inches (Ap, Bt1 horizons);\nArgillic horizon - the zone from approximately 4 to 28 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Btk horizons);\nCalcic feature - the zone from approximately 28 to 53 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizons;\nBorolls feature - inferred from susceptibility to frost in any month except July, inability to grow corn for grain, and certainty of only two cuttings of alfalfa.  Nearest climatic station, at the lower elevation range of the series, shows a mean annual air temperature of 45.6 degrees F.  Most of the Peninsula soil is north-sloping.\nThe other diagnostically similar series do not have the June precipitation minima, and therefore do not behave similarly under use and management for rangeland or for irrigation requirements.\nLast updated by the state 6/95.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
