Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent by volume in the solum and is absent in the substratum.  The soil ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum unless limed, and from very strongly acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe O horizon, where present, is slightly, moderately, or well decomposed organic material.  It has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 2 to 6.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, with value and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon.\nThe upper part of the Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The lower part of the Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 or 6.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nThe type location is changed from Franklin County, MA to Hampden County, MA with this revision as a result of updated mapping for the soil survey of Franklin County. The revised type location is near the typical pedon for the soil survey of Hampden County, Ma, Central Part and is within the same map unit.\nPrevious remarks: Pollux soils have been correlated as Agawam, silty subsoil Variant or silty substratum Variant in the published soil surveys of Franklin County and Plymouth County, Massachusetts. Cation exchange activity class determination based upon a review of available data and similar soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 21 cm (Oi, A, and Ap horizons).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 21 cm to a depth of 78 cm (Bw1, Bw2, BC1, and BC2 horizons).\n3. Oxyaquic feature - based upon saturation in one or more layers within 100 cm of the mineral soil surface, for one month or more per year, in 6 out of 10 years.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
