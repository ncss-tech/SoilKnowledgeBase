  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 35 degrees F.  Thickness of the solum and depth to sandy-skeletal material ranges from 3 to 9 inches.  Texture of the control section is coarse sand and sand.  Coarse fragment content of the control section ranges from 45 to 80 percent gravel and cobble. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline in the solum and neutral to moderately alkaline in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has moist hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; moist value of 2, 3, or 4; and moist chroma of 1, 2, or 3.  Texture is dominantly silt loam but ranges to include silt or very fine sandy loam.  This horizon is extremely thin in some pedons.\nThe Bw horizon has moist hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam, silt or very fine sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has moist hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; moist value of 3 or 4; moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 45 to 80 percent with 5 to 20 percent cobbles and 40 to 75 percent gravel.  Occasional coarse fragments have lime coatings on undersides."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pippin soils are on nearly level high stream terraces, hillslopes and localized glacial outwash deposits on broad lacustrine terraces and undulating till sheets.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  Pippin soils formed in a thin mantle of silty loess over coarse textured alluvium.\nThe climate is subarctic continental with long, cold winters and short, warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 17 inches, and the mean annual snowfall is 39 to 68 inches.  Mean January temperature is minus 10 degrees F., mean July temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature varies from 23 to 27 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",

Copper River soils are on broad lacustrine terraces and stream terraces mantled with 10 inches or more of loess.  Tolsona soils are in depressions between moraines and on till plains and have coarse-loamy control sections."

The successional state of vegetation in a given area is closely related to the fire history. The soil is used primarily for wildlife habitat; however, some areas are used as a source of gravel."
