  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil between the depths of 10 to 27 inches is dry in all parts from April 1 to about December 1. The moisture control section is moist in some part, less than 90 consecutive days. The soil moisture regime is aridic bordering on xeric. The mean annual soil temperature varies from 64 degrees to 67 degrees F. and is never less than 47 degrees F. Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent and size ranges from 2 to 40mm in diameter with most of the 6 to 40mm in the C horizon. The soil is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam with 5 to 18 percent clay content.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3 or 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/3 or 4/4. Only the upper 2 inches of the A horizon has moist colors of 10YR 3/2 or 3/3. It has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure or is massive. The upper part of the A horizon is neutral and the lower part is mildly to moderately alkaline.  Typically, the A horizon in noncalcareous from 0 to 2 inches and it is strongly or violently effervescent with disseminated lime below a depth of 2 inches.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 6/3, 6/4, 7/3 or 7/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/3, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4 or 6/4. The C horizon is strongly or violently effervescent with disseminated lime. Calcium carbonate ranges from 10 to 12 percent."
