  "OVERVIEW": "The Pardaloe series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from sandstone, siltstone or shale.  Pardaloe soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1520 mm (60 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact and thickness of the solum is 100 to 150 centimeters.  The mean annual soil temperature is 12 to 15 degrees C and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 6 degrees C or more. The soils have a mesic temperature regime.  The soil between depths of 25 and 76 centimeters is moist in all parts from November 1 to May 15 and it is dry in all parts from July 1 to October 1 in most years.  The soils have a xeric soil moisture regime. Clay content throughout the profile ranges from 15 to 27 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 40 to 90 percent.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/4, 4/4, 5/4; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 7/4, 6/4, or 6/2. Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3; 7.5YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 5/4, 4/4.  Where mollic colors occur the layer is too thin to qualify as a mollic epipedon.  Base saturation (sum) ranges from 40 to 80 percent.  It is gravelly sandy loam, gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam, or very gravelly loam.  Gravel content is 15 to 50 percent.  Cobble content is 0 to 10 percent.  Total coarse fragment content is 15 to 60 percent.\nThe B horizon is 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 6/6, 7/4; 7.5YR 7/6, 6/6, 6/4; 2.5Y 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 4/3, 5/6, 5/4, 4/4; 7.5YR 5/6, 5/4, 4/4; 2.5Y 4/4, 5/4.  It is sandy loam, loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam and is very gravelly or extremely gravelly.  Gravel content is 35 to 85 percent.  Cobble content is 0 to 20 percent.  Total coarse fragment content is 35 to 85 percent.  In some pedons there is a slight increase in clay content over the A horizon but not enough to qualify for an argillic horizon.  Base saturation (sum) ranges from 50 to 90 percent."

The Burwill series is deep to igneous bedrock and Itat soils are very deep and derived from igneous material.  Brownbear, Caris, and Maki soils have a lithic contact at 50 to 100 centimeters.  Cohila and Frazier soils lack a soil description. Elsman soils are very deep.  Indleton soils are very deep and have mean annual soil temperatures of 8 to 11 degrees C. Skyland soils are derived from gneissic bedrock and have paralithic contact between 100 to 150 centimeters."
