  "OVERVIEW": "The Penner series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from calcareous shale and sandstone.  Penner soils are on stream terraces, valley floors, alluvial flats and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
