  "OVERVIEW": "The Plaisted series consists of very deep, well drained soils on drumlins and till ridges.  These soils formed in dense till.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and commonly moderately low in the dense substratum.   Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C (41 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1117 m (44 in) at the type location.",

Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 30 percent in the mineral solum and from 10 to 35 percent in the substratum.  Stones and cobbles range from 0 to 10 percent throughout the profile.  Stones and boulders cover 0 to 15 percent of the surface.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the solum and strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nSome areas have an Ap horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular structure.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has weak very fine or fine granular or weak or moderate very thin platy structure. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, with value and chroma of 2 to 4.  The Bhs horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, with value and chroma of 2 or 3.  The Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.

The soils formed in dense glacial till derived mainly from phyllite, slate, metasandstone and some granite.  The climate is humid and cool temperate.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 3 to 7 degrees C (38 to 44 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1168 mm (36 to 46 in).  The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 130 days.  Elevation ranges from 90 to 670 m (300 to 2200 ft) above mean sea level."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Plaisted soils were classified as Typic Haplorthods prior to 1994.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1.  Albic horizon - the zone from 5 to 8 cm (2 to 3 in) (E horizon).\n2.  Spodic horizon - the zone from 8 to 23 cm (9 in) (Bh, Bs1 and Bs2 horizons).\n3. Oxyaquic feature - saturation within 100 cm (40 in) of the mineral soil surface for 20 or more consecutive days or 30 cumulative days in normal years.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Source of data used in establishing taxonomic class and range in characteristics is Technical Bulletin 94, Maine Agricultural Experiment Station, September 1979.\nHistorical Soil Interpretation Record numbers for the Plaisted series are; Plaisted, ME0007; and Plaisted, stony, ME0008.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
