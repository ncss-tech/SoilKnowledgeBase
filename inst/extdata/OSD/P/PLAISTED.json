    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to the dense lodgement till ranges from 51 to 76 cm (20 to 30 in).  Depth to bedrock is more than 152 cm (60 in). The weighted average of clay in the particle-size control section is less than 10 percent.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction in the mineral solum and substratum is silt loam or loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 30 percent in the mineral solum and from 10 to 35 percent in the substratum.  Stones and cobbles range from 0 to 10 percent throughout the profile.  Stones and boulders cover 0 to 15 percent of the surface.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the solum and strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nSome areas have an Ap horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular structure.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has weak very fine or fine granular or weak or moderate very thin platy structure. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, with value and chroma of 2 to 4.  The Bhs horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, with value and chroma of 2 or 3.  The Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The B horizons have weak very fine or fine granular structure.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It has weak or moderate, thin to thick platy or weak very fine subangular blocky structure, or it is massive.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has weak or moderate, thin to very thick platy, or coarse or very coarse prismatic parting to platy structure or the horizon is massive.  All structure in the Cd horizon is considered inherited from the parent material.  Consistence is firm or very firm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Becket, Marlow and Mundalite series. Becket soils have greater than 20 percent sandy lenses or strata in the Cd horizon. Marlow soils average less than 50 percent silt content in the particle-size control section.  Mundalite soils have redox features within a depth of 100 cm (40 in), have less than 50 percent silt in the particle-size control section and have spodic horizons greater than 46 cm (18 in) thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Plaisted soils are on drumlins and till ridges.  Slope is commonly 3 to 25 percent, but ranges from 0 to 45 percent.  The soils formed in dense glacial till derived mainly from phyllite, slate, metasandstone and some granite.  The climate is humid and cool temperate.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 3 to 7 degrees C (38 to 44 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1168 mm (36 to 46 in).  The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 130 days.  Elevation ranges from 90 to 670 m (300 to 2200 ft) above mean sea level."

Bangor soils are located in similar positions on the landscape but lack dense lodgement till. The Burnham, Howland and Monarda soils are wetter and are in lower positions on the landscape. Penquis and Thorndike soils are in higher positions on the landscape."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Plaisted soils were classified as Typic Haplorthods prior to 1994.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1.  Albic horizon - the zone from 5 to 8 cm (2 to 3 in) (E horizon).\n2.  Spodic horizon - the zone from 8 to 23 cm (9 in) (Bh, Bs1 and Bs2 horizons).\n3. Oxyaquic feature - saturation within 100 cm (40 in) of the mineral soil surface for 20 or more consecutive days or 30 cumulative days in normal years.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Source of data used in establishing taxonomic class and range in characteristics is Technical Bulletin 94, Maine Agricultural Experiment Station, September 1979.\nHistorical Soil Interpretation Record numbers for the Plaisted series are; Plaisted, ME0007; and Plaisted, stony, ME0008.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
