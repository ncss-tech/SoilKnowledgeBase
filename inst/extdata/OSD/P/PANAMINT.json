  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nDepth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 55 degrees F.  Organic carbon of the upper 18 inches ranges from 0.6 to 2 percent and decreases regularly with increasing depth to less than 0.6 percent at a depth of 20 inches.  The soil is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The soils are dry in all parts from mid-July to November for about 110 consecutive days and moist in all parts from January to April for about 90 consecutive days.  The soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. from mid-March to December for about 260 days.\nThe A horizons have dry color of 10YR 5/2, 4/2, or 5/3 and moist color of 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.  It is very fine sandy loam or cobbly very fine sandy loam.  Rock fragments consist of a mixture of 5 to 3 5 percent pebbles and cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4; 7.5YR 5/2 or 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3; or 7.5YR 3/2.  It is gravelly very fine sandy loam or gravelly fine sandy loam.  Clay ranges from 10 to 18 percent.  Rock fragments average 15 to 35 percent, mostly pebbles and some cobbles.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3 or 6/3 and moist color of 10YR 3/3 or 3/4.  It is gravelly sandy loam or gravelly fine sandy loam.  Rock fragments average 15 to 35 percent, mostly pebbles and some cobbles."

Chenoweth, Cleverly, Knutsen, Newbon, and Wato soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock.  Cushenbury soils average 4 to 10 percent clay in the solum, are neutral or slightly acid, and have a Bt horizon with few thin clay films bridging mineral grains.  Duart and Hesslan soils are influenced by volcanic ash.  In addition, Duart soils have less than 5 percent rock fragments and have a loam or silt loam B horizon.  Hesslan soils have a loam or gravelly loam B horizon and soil temperature of 47 to 51 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Panamint soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in material weathered from granitic rocks.  The bedrock consists of weathered and fractured granite, granodiorite, and quartz monzonite with powdery lime in the fractures.  Some pedons lack lime.  Elevations are 4,000 to 6,500 feet.  The climate is semiarid with hot, dry summers with infrequent summer thunder storms of short duration and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.; the mean January temperature is 40 degrees F.; and the mean July temperature is 80 degrees F.  The frost free season is 185 to 235 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The soil is considered to have an intergrade to an aridic moisture regime.  The number of days the soil is dry above 41 degrees F. is only slightly less than 1/2 of the time.  Future study should evaluate whether this series has an aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric and should be reclassified to an Aridic Haploxeroll.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
