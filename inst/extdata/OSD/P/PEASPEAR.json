  "OVERVIEW": "The Peaspear series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess-influenced alluvium or colluvium derived from limestone, calcareous siltstone, or calcareous mudstone.  These soils are on fan remnants, hillslopes, and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 1 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
