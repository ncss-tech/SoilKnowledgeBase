  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 60 to more than 120 inches. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid, and commonly is neutral in the surface horizons. Fragments of chert commonly range from 0 to 5 percent by volume in the solum, and can range from 0 to 15 percent in the lower part of the solum in some pedons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon in the upper part has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. The lower part of the horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10R, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10R, values of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles in shades of brown and gray range from none to common. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.  The Brinkman and Valton series are closely related, but differ in CEC activity class. The Brinkman and Valton series have a thicker mantle of loess and yellower hues in the upper solum. In addition, mean annual rainfall is less than 35 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nearly level uplands and karst areas. Slopes commonly are 0 to 2 percent and in some areas can range to 12 percent. These soils formed in a thin silty mantle, presumably loess, and in part in the underlying older alluvium or limestone residuum or both. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 50.9 inches."

Baxter soils have more than 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent chert fragments in the subsoil. Crider soils have upper Bt horizons with hues yellower than 5YR, and lacks the darker colored epipedon 7.2 inches or thicker. Vertrees soils have more than 35 percent clay in the upper Bt horizons, redder hues in the upper solum. Elk soils are on stream terraces have B horizons with hue of 7.5YR or yellower, and lacks the darker colored epipedon. The Huntington, Newark, and Nolin soils are on floodplains lack argillic horizons. Nicholson soils are moderately well drained and have a fragipan in the subsoil."
