Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent in the A and BA horizons and from 35 to 70 percent in the Bg and Bw horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 3 or less; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  Texture is mucky silty clay or clay.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 3 or less; or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown and gray range from none to common.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, or clay.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 or less; or it is neutral with value of 3 to 6.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown and gray range from few to common.   Texture is the gravelly, cobbly, or stony analogs of silty clay or clay.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, red, brown, and gray range from few to many.

All of these soils have less rock fragments in the control section and are non-skeletal.  In addition, Dwarf soils are on higher positions, have a histic epipedon, and are isomesic.  Guayabota soils are shallow to bedrock.  Moteado soils are deep to bedrock and have more clay in the control section.  The moderately well drained Yunque soils have less clay in the control section.  The well drained Zarzal soils have more clay in the control section."
