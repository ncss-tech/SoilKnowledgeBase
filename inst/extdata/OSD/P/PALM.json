  "OVERVIEW": "The Palm series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on concave positions of benches along mountainsides.  They formed in residuum and colluvium that weathered from andesitic to basaltic, marine deposited volcanic and volcanoclastic sandstone.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 180 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F.  Slopes range from 35 to 85 percent.",
