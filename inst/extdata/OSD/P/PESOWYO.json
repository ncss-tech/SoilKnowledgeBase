  "OVERVIEW": "The Pesowyo series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum derived primarily from limestone and calcaeous sandstone.  They are on mountain hillslopes.  Slopes range from 6 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 455 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6 degrees c.",
