The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent lithic rock fragments and 10 to 25 percent pumice.  The upper 7 to 14 inches of the soil has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.95 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  Texture is gravelly fine sandy loam, very gravelly fine sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam.\nThe 2BC horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 3 to 4 moist and dry.  Texture is very gravelly sandy loam, very cobbly loamy sand, or very gravelly loamy sand.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.  Texture is extremely cobbly loamy sand, very cobbly loamy sand, or very gravelly loamy sand."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Palmont soils are on mountainsides that generally have a north aspect.  Slopes are 30 to 90 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium from rhyolite and granodiorite with a mantle of volcanic ash and pumice.  Elevations are 2,200 to 5,300 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 25 to 35 inches.  The average January temperature is 42 degrees F., average July temperature is 65 degrees F., average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 80 to 110 days."
