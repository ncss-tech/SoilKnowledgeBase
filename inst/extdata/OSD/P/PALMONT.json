  "OVERVIEW": "The Palmont series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium from rhyolite and granodiorite with a mantle of volcanic ash and pumice.  Palmont soils are on mountain slopes at elevations of 2,200 to 5,300 feet.  Slopes range from 30 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 to 45 inches, and average annual  temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.
