  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the gravelly, cobbly and sandy wave washed material ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 19 to 38 inches.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 35 to 72 inches.  The soil ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.  Gravel content ranges from 15 to 50 percent in the A and E horizons, 35 to 65 percent in the Bhs and Bs horizons, and 10 to 65 percent in the rest of the pedon.  Cobble content ranges from 5 to 25 percent in the A and E horizons and 5 to 40 percent in the rest of the pedon.  Stone content ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the profile.  The particle size control section averages greater than 35 percent rock fragments by volume.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, and ranges up to 4 inches thick.  The A and E horizons are the gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly, or very cobbly analogues of loamy sand, sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam..\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and chroma of 2 or 3.  The Bs horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The B horizons are the extremely gravelly or very gravelly analogues of coarse sand, sand, or loamy sand.\nThe E part of the 2(E/B)x horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The B part of the 2(E/B)x and Bx horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  The 2(E/B)x and Btx horizons are loamy sand, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogues of these textures.  Some pedons have a 2(B/E)x horizon that has textures and colors similar to the 2(E/B)x horizon.  The fragipan horizons are very hard or extremely hard when dry and firm to extremely firm when moist.  Faint or distinct redoximorphic features are in the upper part of the fragipan in many pedons as a result of impeded drainage.\nThe 2Cd horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is the gravelly, very gravelly or extremely gravelly analogues of sand, loamy sand or sandy loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are none.  Closely related series are the Allouez, Trimountain, Waiska and Yalmer soils.  The Allouez and Waiska soils lack fragipans and argillic horizons.  The Trimountain soils are coarse-loamy and the Yalmer soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Paavola soils are on ground moraines and end moraines of Wisconsin age.  They have formed in 20 to 40 inches of gravelly or cobbly sandy wave washed glacial drift underlain by gravelly loamy or sandy till.  The material contains fragments of basalt and andesite amygdaloids and conglomerates derived from the Portage Lake Lava Series.  Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  Local climate is affected by Lake Superior causing high snowfall.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 36 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gratiot (T), Lac La Belle (T), Montreal (T), Sabattis, Trimountain, and Waiska soils.  The well drained Lac La Belle (T) soils and somewhat poorly drained Gratiot (T) soils form a drainage sequence with the Paavola soil.  The excessively drained Waiska soils are on old lake and beach deposits.  Montreal and Trimountain soils are coarse-loamy and are in similar landscape positions as the Paavola soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Gratiot soils and the poorly drained Sabattis soils are in depressions and drainageways."
