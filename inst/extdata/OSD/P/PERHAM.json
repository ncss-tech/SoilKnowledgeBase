  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the mineral solum and depth to the dense basal till ranges from 51 through 76 centimeters. Depth to bedrock is more than 152 centimeters. Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent by volume in the mineral soil. Rock fragments in the mineral soil are primarily gravels, with varying amounts of channers, cobbles, and stones. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid in the upper part of the mineral solum and very strongly acid through slightly acid in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum.\nThe O horizon, where present, has hues of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4. It is composed of fibric, hemic, and/or sapric materials.\nThe Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bhs horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. The Bh horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 1 through 3. The Bs horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8. The B horizons are silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe BC horizon, or E' horizon where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6. It is silt loam, loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. All structure in the Cd horizon is considered inherited (geogenic) from the parent material. Consistence is firm or very firm."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Perham soils are on till plains and ridges. Slope is dominantly 8 to 15 percent, but ranges from 0 to 35 percent. The soils formed in dense till derived mainly from slate, shale, metasediments, and some phyllite. The climate is humid and cool temperate. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 905 through 1002 millimeters and mean average temperature is 3.1 Celsius. The frost-free season ranges from 80 through 105 days. Elevation ranges from 37 through 579 meters above mean sea level."

    "content": "REMARKS: The classification is changed with this update from Fine-loamy, isotic, frigid Aquic Haplorthods to Fine-loamy, mixed, active, frigid Aquic Haplorthods.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 13 centimeters (Oa and E horizons).\nb. Albic horizon - the zone from 9 to 13 centimeters (E horizon).\nc. Spodic horizon - the zone from 13 to 46 centimeters (Bs1 and Bs2 horizons).\nd. Aquic feature - redoximorphic features within 46 centimeters of the mineral soil surface.\ne. Densic contact - at 70 centimeters.\nf. Densic materials - the zone from 70 to 165 centimeters (Cd horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: This pedon was sampled in 2007, USDA - NRCS National Soil Survey Lab number 09NO165. Other sources of data used in establishing taxonomic class and range in characteristics are Maine Agricultural Experiment Station Technical Bulletin Number 75, NRCS characterization data, and composite data from the Field Appraisal of Resource Management Systems compiled by Dr. Paul R. Hepler, Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, University of Maine at Orono, Orono, Maine.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
