  "OVERVIEW": "The Palermo series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in thick loess. These soils are on strongly dissected loess hills and bluffs bordering the Missouri River Valley and its tributaries. Slopes range from 5 to 35 percent. Mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C. (55 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation is 91 centimeters (36 inches).",
