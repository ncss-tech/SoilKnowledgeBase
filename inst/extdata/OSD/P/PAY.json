Kingsville soils formed in forested continental climate, have Bg horizons, less than 10 percent gravel within the substratum and average annual soil temperature of 50 to 53 degrees F. Marlake soils formed in forested continental climate, have Oe horizons, carbonates between 0 and 15 inches and slightly alkaline Cg horizons. Plev soils formed in forested continental climate, have Cg and 2Btgb horizons and average annual soil temperature of 57 to 59 degrees F. Tobico soils formed in forested continental climate, have Cg horizons and calcium carbonate in the upper 15 inches.

These soils formed in alluvium from igneous rocks (dominantly granodiorite). Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. The average annual precipitation is 20 to 26 inches. The average annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."
