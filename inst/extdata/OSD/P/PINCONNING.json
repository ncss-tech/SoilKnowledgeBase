  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pinconning soils are on lake plains, lake terraces, and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in sandy lacustrine deposits and outwash underlain by clayey lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 965 mm (28 to 38 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.6 to 7.2 degrees C (42 to 45 degrees F)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Allendale, Au Gres, Brevort, Manistee, and Roscommon soils. The well drained Manistee and the somewhat poorly drained Allendale soils are in the same drainage sequence. The competing Brevort and Roscommon soils are common associates in some areas. The Au Gres soils are sandy throughout the profile and are somewhat poorly drained."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained or very poorly drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between October and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the upper part and moderately low or low in the lower part. Permeability is rapid in the upper part and slow or very slow in the lower part."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Only a small part is under cultivation. Principal crops are small grains, corn, hay, and some vegetables. Most of the soil is in cut over woodland, permanent pasture, or is idle cropland. Native vegetation is chiefly black ash, aspen, black spruce, and northern white cedar."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon (mollic intergrade): from the surface to a depth of 20 cm (8 inches) (Ap horizon).\nLithologic discontinuity: at 76 cm (30 inches) (top of the 2Cg3 horizon).\nAquic conditions: dominant chroma of less than 2 within 75 cm (30 inches) and redoximorphic features present in all horizons below 20 cm (8 inches).\nThis pedon is from an older (pre-1963) soil survey, and therefore is not described to 152 cm (60 inches). All other areas mapped as Pinconning in Michigan would be recorrelated to the Wakeley Series (Aeric Epiaquents).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Records: MI0110; MI0513 (MUCKY SURFACE); MI0514 (LOAMY SURFACE).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
