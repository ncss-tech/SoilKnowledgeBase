Luckycreek soils are dry for 75 to 100 consecutive days and have secondary carbonates at 25 to 40 inches.  Powellbutte soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Runyon soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact.  The Hess, Lidos, Melhorn, Raycreek (T), Salcreek (T) and Tourn series are similar, but have isotic mineralogy. Hess soils are 40 to 60 inches deep. Hess, Lidos, Melhorn, Raycreek and Salcreek soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick. Raycreek and Tourn soils are less than 40 inches deep."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pinney soils are moderately steep to very steep on dissected fan remnants, outwash terrace remnants and lower mountain slopes at elevations of 3,050 to 4,800 feet. These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from igneous rocks and fine pyroclastic materials with the upper part having more recent additions of volcanic ash. Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent. Average annual precipitation is 26 to 30 inches. Average annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. Frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."
