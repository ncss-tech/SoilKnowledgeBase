  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the mineral solum and depth to the densic contact ranges from 50 to 100 cm. Depth to bedrock is commonly more than 1.5 meters. Rock fragments range from 5 through 35 percent by volume in the mineral soil. Except where the surface is stony, the fragments are mostly subrounded gravel and typically make up 60 percent or more of the total rock fragments. Unless limed, reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the mineral soil.\nThe O horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR or it is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 2. It is mainly composed of slightly, moderately, or highly decomposed plant material.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Dry value is 6 or more.   The structure is commonly granular but the range includes subangular blocky in some pedons. Undisturbed pedons have a thin A horizon with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. The Ap or A horizon is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon below the A horizon. It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe upper part of the Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. The lower part of the Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Some pedons have few faint redoximorphic features just above the Cd horizon. The Bw horizon is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam with less than 65 percent silt plus very fine sand. It has granular or subangular blocky structure Consistence is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon up to 20 cm thick.\nSome pedons have an E or E' horizon up to 8 cm thick below the B horizon. It has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Typically, it is coarser textured than the overlying horizon.\nThe Cd has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. In some pedons there are a few faint or distinct areas of iron depletion or masses of iron accumulation in the upper part. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. A few thin lenses of loamy sand are in some pedons. The structure is geogenetically derived, appearing in the form of medium to very thick plates, or it is massive. Consistence is firm or very firm. Some pedons have a friable C horizon above the Cd horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are Amostown, Bernardston, Broadbrook, Horseneck, Nantucket, Scituate, and Wethersfield series. Amostown soils are underlain by stratified very fine sand or silt within a depth of 100 cm. Bernardston and Broadbrook soils have a solum with more than 65 percent silt plus very fine sand. Horseneck soils lack a densic contact. Nantucket soils have a lithologic discontinuity. Scituate soils have sandy substrata. Wethersfield soils have 5YR or redder hue in the B and C horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Paxton soils are nearly level to steep and are on till plains, ground moraines, hills, and drumlins. Slope commonly is 0 to 35 percent, but range from 0 to 45 percent in some pedons. The soils formed in acid lodgment till derived mostly from schist, gneiss, and granite. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C., mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1245 mm, and the growing season ranges from 115 to 180 days."

The moderately well drained Woodbridge, poorly drained Ridgebury, and the very poorly drained Whitman soils are associated in a drainage sequence. Canton soils have a friable loamy sand substratum.  Well drained Stockbridge and moderately well drained Georgia soils have higher base status. Hollis soils have bedrock within a depth of 25 to 50 cm. Leicester soils are poorly drained and do not have a dense substratum. Montauk soils have sandy substrata. Narragansett soils have a lithologic discontinuity within a depth of 100 cm and a solum high in silt and very fine sand. Sutton and Wapping soils are moderately well drained and do not have a dense substratum."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Paxton is the state soil of Massachusetts.\nPrior revisions included changes to the range in characteristics as well as general updating to metric units. Cation exchange activity class placement was determined from a review of limited lab data and similar or associated soils. Paxton soils were previously classified as Typic Dystrochrepts, and before that as Typic Fragiochrepts.\nThe Paxton series was previously used in some surveys in Maine. Maine determined from soil temperature studies that the mesic soil temperature regime would no longer be used.  Maine is re-evaluating the soil temperature regimes in southern Maine as of the date of this revision.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 20 cm (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 20 to 66 cm (Bw horizons).\n3. Densic material - the zone from 66 to 165 cm (Cd horizon).\n4. Oxyaquic subgroup - based on saturation in one or more layers within 100 cm of the mineral surface, for one month or more per year, in 6 out of 10 years.\n5) Particle-size control section - the zone from 20 to 66 cm (Bw horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Full characterization data for pedons with User Pedon IDs of S1955MA027002, S1955NH015001, S1973MA005001, S1973MA005006, S1975CT013001, S1996NH013001, S1999NY061001. Pedons analyzed by the NSSL, Lincoln, NE. Laboratory characterization data for these pedons and similar soils is available through the National Cooperative Soil Survey Soil Characterization Database: http://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
