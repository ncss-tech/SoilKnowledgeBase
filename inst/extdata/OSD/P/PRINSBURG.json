  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 12 to 24 inches in thickness. Calcium carbonates are in all parts between 10 and 20 inches. The calcium carbonate equivalent typically ranging from 5 to 25 percent throughout, however, the Ap horizon may be leached in some pedons. The thickness of the upper sediment and depth to glacial till ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Some pedons have calcic horizons below a depth of 16 inches. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout. The upper mantle typically does not have rock fragments and averages less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser. Rock fragments, of mixed lithology, range from 2 to 10 percent by volume in the underlying glacial till.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1. It is silty clay loam or silt loam.\nThe Bkg and Bg horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silty clay loam or silt loam.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 1 to 4. It is loam or clay loam. The content of fine sand and coarser ranges from 20 to 40 percent"

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

These soils formed in calcareous, silty lacustrine sediments overlying calcareous, loamy glacial till. These sediments are late Wisconsin in age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 30 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 124 to 155 days. Elevation ranges from 1,000 to 1,125 feet above sea level."

Chetomba soils are poorly drained and are on similar landscape positions, but are not calcareous throughout. Doland soils are well drained and are on higher back slopes and summits. Quam soils are very poorly drained and are in closed depressions. Tara soils are moderately well drained and are on low back slopes or summits."
