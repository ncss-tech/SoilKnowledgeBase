  "OVERVIEW": "The Prinsburg series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous, silty lacustrine sediments overlying calcareous, loamy glacial till on ground moraines. The permeability is moderate. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches.",

The calcium carbonate equivalent typically ranging from 5 to 25 percent throughout, however, the Ap horizon may be leached in some pedons. The thickness of the upper sediment and depth to glacial till ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Some pedons have calcic horizons below a depth of 16 inches. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout. The upper mantle typically does not have rock fragments and averages less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser. Rock fragments, of mixed lithology, range from 2 to 10 percent by volume in the underlying glacial till.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1. It is silty clay loam or silt loam.\nThe Bkg and Bg horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silty clay loam or silt loam.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 1 to 4. It is loam or clay loam.

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 30 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 124 to 155 days.
