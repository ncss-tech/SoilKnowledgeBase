  "STATES": "AZ,CO,NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Progresso series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils  formed in alluvium derived from sandstone or limestone. Progresso soils  are on old terraces, benches, mesas, and upland hills and ridges. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

Soil reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nBt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 4  or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is typically clay loam or sandy clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay.  Soil reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nBk horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 5 through 8, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It has common, medium to coarse, soft to hard, lime bodies and lime pendants on pebbles as well as disseminated lime.  Texture is loam or sandy clay loam.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 35 percent.  Some pedons have a thin paralithic layer above the bedrock."
