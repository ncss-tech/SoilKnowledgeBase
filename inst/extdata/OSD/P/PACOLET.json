    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The Bt horizon is at least 10 to 24 inches thick and extends to a depth of 18 to 30 inches. Depth to a lithic contact is more than 60 inches. The soil is very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A horizon, and very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout the rest of the profile. Content of rock fragments, dominantly gravel, ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the A and E horizons, and 0 to 15 percent in the Bt horizon. Most pedons have few to\ncommon flakes of mica in the solum, and few to many in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 6. In eroded areas, hue ranges to 2.5YR and chroma ranges to 8. The A horizon commonly is sandy loam, but ranges to loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, fine sandy loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction. In eroded areas, it is clay loam or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. It commonly is sandy loam, but ranges to loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, fine sandy loam, loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BA or BE horizon, where present, and the upper part of the Bt in most pedons, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is clay loam, sandy clay loam, or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8. Mottles in shades of red, yellow, or brown are in the upper part of the Bt horizon in some pedons and in the lower part of the Bt horizon in most pedons. Texture is clay, sandy clay, or clay loam.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8 commonly with mottles in shades of red, yellow, or brown. The BC horizon of some pedons is mottled in shades of red, yellow, or brown. It is clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10R to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8 commonly with mottles in shades of red, yellow, or brown or is multicolored.  Texture is loamy saprolite weathered from felsic crystalline rock."

Appling and Cecil soils have a thicker clayey Bt horizon. Bethlehem soils have a paralithic contact within 20 to 40 inches of the surface. Georgeville, Herndon, Nanford, and Tarrus soils formed from Carolina slate and have more than 30 percent silt. Lloyd soils have value of 3 in at least part of the Bt horizon. Madison soils contain more mica. Nankin soils formed from marine sediments. Saw soils have a lithic contact within 20 to 40 inches of the surface. Wedowee soils have Bt horizons with hue of 5YR or yellower."
