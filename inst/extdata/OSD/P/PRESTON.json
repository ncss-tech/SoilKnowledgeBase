The soil moisture regime is Xeric bordering on Aridic.\nThe soil is noncalcareous to moderately calcareous. Average texture of the 10 to 40 inch control section is fine sand marginal to loamy fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR; value 3 to 5 moist, and from 4 to 6 dry, with chromas of 2 to 4.  Texture is fine sand.  In places, the surface is covered with a 1 to 3 inch layer of recently deposited fine sand similar to the C horizon. Organic matter content of the A horizon ranges from 0.6 to 1.0 percent.  Reaction is slightly to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 4 to 6 moist and 5 to 7 dry, and chromas of 3 and 4, dry or moist.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand, or sand."

Bisbee and Solo soils have O horizons.  Chimney soils have dominantly loamy coarse sand and coarse sand in the control section, are slightly acid or neutral and contain 5 to 30 percent rock fragments.  Coneward soils are dry for 125 days after the summer solstice.  Dart soils are slightly acid to neutral.  Ewall soils are dry more than 90 consecutive days and may include loamy sand and coarse sand in the particle-size control section.  Panamaker soils average 15 to 50 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregates in the particle-size control section.  Santaquin soils have hues of 5YR."

Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  Dunes ranging in height from about 3 to 6 feet are common. The climate is dry subhumid. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 F. to 52 degrees F., the average summer temperature ranges from 65  F. to 73 degrees F., and the frost free season ranges from 120 to 175 days. The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 19 inches.  Elevation is 4300 to 6200 feet."
