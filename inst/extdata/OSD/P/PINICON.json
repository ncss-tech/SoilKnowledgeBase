One or more horizons have chroma of 3 or more in at least half the matrix.  The 2Bt horizon typically is loam or clay loam but ranges to include sandy clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 24 to 28 percent.  Tongues of sandy loam or loamy sand extend downward from the pebble band to depths of 3 to 5 feet in some pedons.\nThe 2BC and 2C horizons have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 or 6; and chroma of 1 to 8.

Angola, Mitiwanga, and Shadeland soils have bedrock at depths less than 40 inches.  Appleton soils have more coarse fragments throughout the soil.  Aubbeenaubbee soils have a higher sand content in the upper part of the solum.  Ayrshire soils also have a higher sand content and formed from eolian sands.  Burdett and Darien soils have from 5 to 30 percent or more by volume of shale fragments in their sola.  Capac, Crosier, and Shebeon soils have a thinner solum and are shallower to carbonates.  Digby, Jimtown, and Sleeth soils are underlain by stratified outwash high in sand and gravel.  Haskins soils have more clay in the lower part of the B horizon and C horizon. Luther soils have a higher average clay content in the Bt horizons and lack a lithologic discontinuity.  Ovid soils have redder hue in the B horizons.  Whitaker soils contain more illite clay and are developed in and underlain by stratified outwash or lacustrine sediments."

They are on convex or slightly concave ridgetops and weakly defined sideslopes of 0 to 4 percent gradient.  Pinicon soils formed in 14 to 24 inches of loamy sediments containing about 15 to 35 percent fine to coarse sand and the underlying loamy glacial till.  In most pedons, a thin pebble band is at the boundary between the two materials.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 45 to 49 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 30 to 34 inches."

Bassett and Coggon soils are on steeper slopes and have browner upper B horizons.   Clyde, Floyd, and Schley soils are down-slope and are derived from stratified materials 2 to 3 feet thick.  Pinicon soils form a biosequence with the Oran and Readlyn soils.  Oran soils have a thicker A horizon.  Readlyn soils have a mollic epipedon.  Pinicon soils also form a partial hydrosequence with the moderately well drained Coggon soils."
