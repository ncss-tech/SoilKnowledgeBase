  "OVERVIEW": "The Pattee series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium. Pattee soils are on dissected stream terraces and foothills.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes are 1 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
