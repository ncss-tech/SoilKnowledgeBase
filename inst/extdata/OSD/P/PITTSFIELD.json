  "OVERVIEW": "The Pittsfield series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in calcareous till. They are nearly level to very steep soils on uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity ranges from moderately low to high. Mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum ranges from 20 to 45 inches. Bedrock is deeper than 65 inches. Rock fragments consist primarily of schist and weathered limestone. Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent in the A horizon and from 5 to 34 percent in the B and C horizons. Cobbles typically occupy 0 to 15 percent of the A, 0 to 10 percent of the B and 0 to 15 percent of the C horizon. Gravel content typically ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the A, from 5 to 15 percent in the B and from 5 to 20 percent in the C horizon. Gravel content in the C horizon can range up to 34 percent but the horizon has less than 35 percent rock fragments. Depth to carbonates ranges from 40 to 72 inches. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the A; commonly moderately acid to neutral in the Ap but the range includes very strongly acid; from strongly acid to neutral in the upper part of the B horizon and from moderately acid to neutral in the lower part of the B horizon; and from moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the C horizon. Reaction is less acid than strongly acid and base saturation is more than 60 percent in some part of the 10 to 30 inch depth.\nThe Ap and A have a hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. They are loam or fine sandy loam. They have weak or moderate fine and medium granular structure and friable or very friable consistence.\nSome pedons have a thin E, EB, or BE horizon below the A horizon. It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. They are loam or fine sandy loam. Structure is weak fine or medium granular, or weak fine and medium subangular blocky and consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizons have hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, values of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam. Structure is weak fine or medium granular, or commonly weak fine and medium subangular blocky but the range includes weak coarse subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or gravelly or channery analogs. It is massive or has weak thick or very thick platy structure. Chroma of 2 is lithochromic and not related to wetness. Some pedons have a few high chroma redoximorphic concentrations in the lower part of the BC horizon.\nThe C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. They are loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or their gravelly or channery analogs. Pockets or lenses of loamy sand or sand are in some pedons. The C horizon is massive or appears in the form of non-pedogenically derived plates. It is friable or firm."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Herkimer, Lowville, Reger (tentative), Spoolsville, Urne and Wakeman series. Nellis and Stockbridge soils are in a closely related family.\nHerkimer soils have 20 to 60 percent fragments of dark shale in the lower part of the series control section. Lowville soils have silt loam textures in the solum. Spoolsville soils formed in residuum and are 40 to 60 inches to a paralithic contact. Reger, Urne and Wakeman soils formed in residuum and have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.\nStockbridge soils have a firm till substratum within 40 inches. Nellis soils effervesce at depths less than 40 inches from the soil surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pittsfield soils are nearly level to very steep on glaciated uplands associated with limestone valleys. Slopes are commonly 3 to 25 percent but range from 0 to 60 percent. The soils formed in stony, moderately coarse textured, calcareous till derived primarily from schist and weathered limestone. Mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation commonly is 44 to 50 inches but the range includes as low as 26 inches in some places east of Adirondack Mountains in the Champlain Valley of New York. Average length of the growing season is 120 to 160 days."

The moderately well drained Amenia, poorly drained Kendaia, and very poorly drained Lyons soils are associated in a drainage sequence. Groton soils formed in water sorted calcareous sand and gravel materials on outwash plains and terraces. Hoosic and Quonset soils formed in water sorted channery or slaty materials on outwash plains and terraces."
