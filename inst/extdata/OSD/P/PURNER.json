  "OVERVIEW": "The Purner series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from limestone and calcareous sandstone. Purner soils are on limestone ridges and have slopes of 2 to 10 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
