  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 63 to 72 degrees F.  The soil temperature is below 47 degrees F. from about December 15 to February 20, and is usually never below 41 degrees F. The soil between the depths of 8 and 24 inches is dry throughout for 275 to 310 days from about March 1 to December 15.  It is moist throughout for 10 to 50 days from about January 1 to March 1 and is moist in some or all parts for 55 to 90 consecutive days from about December 15 to March 1 when the soil is above 47.\nThe A horizon has dry colors of 10YR 6/3 or 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 4/3 or 4/4.  It has 8 to 18 percent clay.  It is noneffervescent or slightly effervescent with disseminated lime.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.  It has 5 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe C horizon has dry colors of 10YR 6/2, 6/3, or 6/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/2, 4/3, or 4/4.  It is stratified with layers of sandy loam, loamy sand, and gravelly loamy sand or gravelly loamy coarse sand.  Textures of loam, clay loam and sandy clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay are common below 40 inches.  It is typically slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent with disseminated lime between 10 and 30 inches.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It typically has 5 to 15 percent gravel, but some pedons have 15 to 35 percent gravel in some horizons."

Anthony, Comoro, Gila, and Grabe soils are moist in the moisture control section in summer.  Excelsior soils never have soil temperatures below 47 degrees F.  Hesperia soils have an aridic moisture regime bordering on xeric.  Ireteba soils have a zone of carbonate accumulation.  Junction and Tobler soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR.  Victorville soils have a moist color value of 3.5 or less and more than 1 percent organic matter in the A horizon."

Elevations are 2,300 to 2,550 feet.  The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool, slightly moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 5 inches. The mean annual temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F. Mean July temperature is about 83 degrees F., and mean January temperature is about 44 degrees F. The frost-free season is 200 to 250 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Popson series is in MLRA 30.  The Popson series is being mapped where it matches the Hesperia series.  It is being differentiated from the Hesperia series because it does not have a aridic moisture regime bordering on xeric.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the profile are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon -- 0 to 9 inches (A1, A2)\n1.1  Organic carbon assumed to be less than 0.6 percent based on laboratory analysis of similar soils in surrounding surveys.\n1.2  Dry color of 10YR 6/3 and 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/3 and 4/4.\nOTHER SOIL CHARACTERISTICS:\n1. FLUVENT SUBORDER: Based on stratification observed in modal pit and the occurrence of occasional flooding.  Organic carbon is assumed to decrease irregularly with depth.\n2. TYPIC SUBGROUP: Meets all requirements for Typic subgroup.\n3. TEMPERATURE REGIME -- Thermic.  MAST 63 to 72 degrees F.  Based on soil temperature data from surrounding soil surveys and preliminary field measurements.\n4. MINERALOGY -- Mixed; no evidence to support any other.\n5. PARTICLE SIZE CLASS -- Coarse-loamy.  The 10- to 40-inch particle- size control section averages 11 percent clay and 72 percent sand based on field estimates.\n6. MOISTURE REGIME - Aridic.  Based on soil moisture data from surrounding soil surveys.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
