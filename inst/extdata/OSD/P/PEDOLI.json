  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pedoli soils are on fan remnants and beach terraces.  They typically occur on summit positions.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Elevations are 1,530 to 2,140 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 280 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."
