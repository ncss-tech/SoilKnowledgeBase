  "OVERVIEW": "The Plymouth series consists of very deep, excessively drained sandy soils formed in glaciofluvial or deltaic deposits derived largely from siliceous rocks. They are nearly level through steep soils on plains and hilly moraines. Slope ranges from 0 through 35 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the mineral solum and very high in the substratum. Mean annual temperature is 51 degrees F. (11 degrees C.), and mean annual precipitation is 46 inches (1168 millimeters).",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 through 40 inches (50 through 100 centimeters). Bedrock is at depths greater than 2 meters. The content of rock fragments, mostly gravel and cobbles, ranges from 0 through 30 percent in individual horizons of the solum and 2 through 50 percent in the substratum, more than 15 percent in the substratum above 40 inches (100 centimeters), but no more than 34 percent in an individual layer within a depth of 40 inches (100 centimeters). The soil ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid throughout.\nSome pedons have an O horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon, if present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is loamy coarse sand, sand, loamy sand, coarse sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons have a thin E horizon below the A horizon.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8, with hue as red as 5YR restricted to subhorizons. It is coarse sand to loamy fine sand in the fine-earth fraction. It is very friable or loose. Some pedons have a Bh, Bs, Bhs, or BC horizon.\nThe 2C or C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 6. It is sand or coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction."

The soils formed in acid, coarse textured material derived largely from siliceous rocks. The underlying sands and gravel extend to great depths. Annual precipitation ranges from 35 through 56 inches (889 through 1422 millimeters). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 49 through 52 degrees F. (9 through 11 degrees C.), and mean annual growing season ranges from 180 through 220 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This revision reflects changes to the range in characteristics as well as general updating to metric units. The series was inactivated in 1961, and was reactivated in 1969. The soil was previously classified as siliceous, mesic Typic Udipsamments. Data from New York and Massachusetts show less than 10 percent weatherable minerals.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 4 inches (0 to 10 centimeters) (A horizon).\n2) Quartzipsamments great group - the determinant fraction (0.02 to 2 mm) is more than 90 percent resistant minerals.\n3) Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 through 40 inches (25 through 100 centimeters) (Bw2, Bw3, 2C horizons).\n4) Lithologic discontinuity - at a depth of 27 inches (69 centimeters)."
