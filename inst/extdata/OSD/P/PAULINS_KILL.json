  "STATES": "NJ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Paulins Kill series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in Wisconsinan glaciofluvial deposits. They are nearly level to very steep soils on outwash deltas and valley trains associated with extinct proglacial lake basins. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation is about 1205 mm.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

Rock fragments include stones, cobbles, and gravel, and range from 2 to 40 percent by volume in the A horizon, 15 to 65 percent in the B horizon, 40 to 80 percent in the BC horizon, and 5 to 85 percent in the individual 2C horizons. Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum and from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum. Reaction increases to slightly alkaline below 2 meters in some pedons.\nThe O horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 2.5, and chroma of 2. It is composed of slightly, moderately, or highly decomposed plant material from woody and/or herbaceous sources.\nThe Ap, or A horizon, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 3 moist or 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist or 2 or 3 dry. Texture of the fine earth fraction is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. It typically has weak or moderate, medium or fine granular structure, but the range includes subangular blocky structure. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have an AB horizon below the A horizon with color and textures similar to the A and B horizons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture of the fine earth fraction is coarse sandy loam or sandy loam. It has weak or moderate, fine or medium granular or subangular blocky structure. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture of the fine earth fraction is loamy coarse sand or loamy sand.\nThe 2C or C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is stratified loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, or sand in the fine earth fraction. It is single grained and has loose consistency."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Paulins Kill soils are nearly level to undulating soils on outwash deltas and valley trains and include \"Gilbert-type\" delta landforms (topset beds, foreset beds, bottomset beds).  These soils are also found on kame terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. The soils formed in coarse-textured glaciofluvial deposits that are predominately composed of red and gray sandstone, gray slate and shale, and quartz pebble conglomerate but also contain some limestone and quartzite and, in some areas, granitic-gneiss. The mean annual precipitation is 920 to 1800 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is 8 to 13 degrees C. The frost free period is 135 to 200 days. Elevation ranges from 30 to 340 meters above sea level."

Halsey soils are very poorly drained and occur in nearby depressions and drainageways. Hazen soils are coarse-loamy and occur in less gravelly areas intermingled closely with Paulins Kill on the landscape.  Otisville soils are excessively drained and occur in higher positions on the landscape."

Umbric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the mineral soil to a depth of 29 cm (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 29 cm to 51 cm (Bw horizon).\n3. Sandy-skeletal feature - averaging 35 percent or more (by volume) rock fragments and a fine-earth fraction with a texture of sand or loamy sand, including less than 50 percent (by weight) very fine sand in the thickest part of the particle-size control section, the zone from 25 to 100 cm (Ap, Bw, BC, and 2C1 horizons)."
