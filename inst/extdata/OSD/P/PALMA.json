  "OVERVIEW": "The Palma series consists of very deep, well and somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and eolian soil material derived from sandstone and shale.  These soils are on hillslopes, plateaus,undulating plains, dunes of plains, fan terraces and fan piedmonts.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
