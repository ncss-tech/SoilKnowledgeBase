    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Khapo (T  NM), Marjane (AZ), Vonid (CO), and Windwhistle (UT) series.  Khapo soils are more moist in the soil moisture control section between December and March, and do not have significant amounts of volcanic glass in the series control section.  Marjane and Windwhistle soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Vonid soils have hues that are more yellow and are more moist in May and June."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Palma soils formed in alluvial and eolian material on hillslopes, plateaus,  undulating plains, dunes of plains, fan terraces and fan piedmonts.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 49 to 55 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches, but is as high as 15 inches in areas.  The majority of the precipitation falls during the late summer.  The frost-free period ranges from 125 to 170 days and elevation ranges from 4,500 to 7,600 feet.  In Utah the frost-free period is as low as 110 days.  In Colorado mean annual temperature ranges as low as 47 degrees."
