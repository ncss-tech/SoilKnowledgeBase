  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinyonpeak series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from granitic rocks. Pinyonpeak soils are on upper backslopes of hills, mountains and rock pediments. Slopes are 8 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 200 millimeters and mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C.",
