  "OVERVIEW": "The Poocham series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in wind or water deposited silts and very fine sands.  They are on terrace escarpments and along deeply dissected drainageways.  Slope ranges from 25 to 80 percent. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderate or moderately slow in the substratum.  Mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 9 inches to 15 inches.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 5 percent throughout the soil.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout.  Chroma of 2 or less are inherited from the parent material and are not indicative of aquic conditions.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5 and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 6.  Structure of the Bw horizon is weak or moderate, fine or medium, granular or subangular blocky.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe C Horizon has hue of 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or silt.  Thin or very thin strata of fine sand, very fine sand, loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, silty clay loam, or silty clay are in some pedons with colors similar to the C range but may include chroma 1."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Hitchcock and Unadilla series.  Hitchcock and Unadilla soils have thicker sola and Unadilla soils have moderately rapid or rapid permeability below a depth of 40 inches.  Bridgehampton soils may be in the same family when updated to the 8th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Bridgehampton soils have thicker sola and formed in outwash material.\nThe Belgrade, Charlton, Chatfield, Dutchess, Enfield, Hartland, Melrose and Scio series are in related families.  Belgrade and Scio soils have redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less within a depth of 24 inches.  Charlton, Chatfield and Dutchess soils are coarse loamy.  Enfield soils are coarse silty over sandy or sandy skeletal.  Hartland soils have base saturation of 60 percent or more.  Melrose soils are underlain by clay below a depth of 18 inches."

Annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 50 inches and mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 degrees to 50 degrees F.  Average frost-free period ranges from 90 to 160 days."

The moderately well drained Scio soil, and the poorly drained Raynham soil, and the very poorly drained Birdsall soil are in depressional areas on associated landscapes.  Agawam, Enfield, Haven, Ninigret, Tisbury soils are on nearby terraces, but formed in loamy over sandy materials.  Deerfield, Merrimac, and Windsor soils are also on nearby terraces, but formed in sandy or gravelly material.  Hadley, Limerick, Occum, Pootatuck, Rippowam, Saco, and Winooski soils are on adjacent floodplains."
