  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 6 feet.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 60 percent in individual horizons, but average 15 to 35 percent in the control section.  Reaction is extremely acid to neutral in the A horizons, and extremely acid to strongly acid in the B and C horizons.  Most pedons have stony or very stony surfaces.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam, or sandy loam.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe BA, Bt and BC horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, sandy loam, or clay loam.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine through coarse subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable to firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, sandy loam, or clay loam.  Consistence is friable to firm.  Some pedons have brown, yellow, and gray mottles."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Albermarle, Allegheny, Allenwood, Arcola, Arendtsville, Aura, Bedington, Birdsboro, Bucks, Butano, Chester, Chetwynd, Chilmark, Clymer, Collington, Edgemont, Edneytown, Elsinboro, Eubanks, Frankstown, Freehold, Gilpin, Glenelg, Leck Kill, Matapeake, Meadowville, Murrill, Nixon, Quakertown, Rayne, Schelocta, Shouns, Syenite, Tate, Thurmont, Ungers, and Whiteford series in the same family. Albermarle, Arcola, Arendtsville, Bedington, Butano, Chester, Clymer, Edgemont, Edneytown, Eubanks, Frankstown, Gilpin, Glenelg, Quakertown, Rayne, Ungers, and Whiteford soils formed in residuum from crystalline or sedimentary rock and have sola less than 40 inches thick, redder argillic horizon hues, or less than 6 feet depth to bedrock. Allegheny, Birdsboro, Elsinboro, Meadowville, and Nixon soils formed in old stream terrace alluvium or local alluvium and contain less than 15 percent rock fragments which are mostly rounded gravel.  Collington and Freehold soils formed in coastal plain sediments and contain none to few pebbles in the argillic horizon.  Allenwood, Aura, Chilmark, and Leck Kill soils formed in materials that are influenced by glaciers and have thinner sola or redder hue in the argillic horizon.\nBucks and Syenite soils have sola less than 40 inches thick. Chetwynd soils formed in a mantle of loess over outwash and typically have redder hues in the Bt horizon.\nMatapeake soils lack rock fragments in the solum.  Tate soils formed in colluvium from crystalline rocks and contain less than 15 percent rock fragments.  Thurmont soils formed in colluvium from crystalline rocks and have an apparent water table at 4 feet. Murrill.  Shelocta, and Shouns soils formed in colluvium from sedimentary rocks.  Murrill soils have solum thickness of 60 inches or more.  Shelocta soils have silt loam or silty clay loam argillic horizons.  Shouns soils have 5YR or redder hues in the argillic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pineville soils are mostly on steep mountain coves, footslopes, and lower sideslopes.  Slope is dominately 25 to 60 percent but ranges from 8 to 80 percent.  Pineville soils formed in colluvium moved downslope from soils formed in residuum weathered from acid sandstone, siltstone, and shale.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 55 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 59 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Clymer and Gilpin soils and the Berks, Cedarcreek, Dekalb, Guyandotte, Hazleton and Lily soils.  Berks, Clymer, Dekalb, Gilpin, Hazleton, and Lily soils formed in residuum and are on higher landscape positions.  Guyandotte soils have an umbric epipedon, more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section, and are generally on northern aspects at higher elevations.  Cedarcreek and Kaymine soils formed in regolith from the surface mining of coal."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Pineville soils are dominately in forest with mixed stands of Northern red oak, yellow-poplar, Eastern hemlock, basswood, hickory, black oak, white oak, cucumbertree, black locust, and black walnut.  Some small areas with less than 25 percent slope are used for pasture and crops."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  (1) Mineralogy data from two West Virginia pedons indicate mixed mineralogy, but both are close to siliceous.  (2) These soils were formerly mapped as Jefferson.  (3) In West Virginia, these soils are formed in colluvium from the New River and the lower part of the Kanawha geologic formation.  (4) Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.) Ochric epipedon - 0 to 3 inches (A horizon).\nb.) Argillic horizon - 10 to 50 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).  (5) Additional Data:  Refer to NSSL characterization pedons S86WV-005- 003, S86WV-109-001, S81WV-109-5, S81WV-109-7 for laboratory data.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nUS.A."
