Wynott soils are well drained.\nThe September 2025 revision corrected terminology.  No data was changed.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 23 centimeters (9 inches) (A1 and A2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone between depths of 41 to 91 centimeters (16 to 36 inches) (Btss, and BCt horizons)\nParalithic contact--the occurrence of weathered bedrock at a depth of 97 centimeters (38 inches) (upper boundary of the Cr horizon)\nLithic contact--the occurance of unweathered bedrock at a depth of 109 centimeters (43 inches) (upper boundary of the R horizon)"
