The mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to the buried argillic horizon is 14 to 20 inches.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe 0i horizon is 2 to 4 inches thick except where disturbed.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is a sandy loam with 10 to 18 percent field estimated clay and 0 to 10 percent gravel.  It has 50 to 80 percent glass and glass coated aggregates.\nThe 2Btb horizons have hue of 10YR and 7.5YR with value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.

Almac soils are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days, have a mean annual soil temperature of 39 to 41 degrees F, and have fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Gap soils are 40 to 60 inches to bedrock.  Shanahan soils are very deep, lack a buried argillic horizon, and contain 0 to 5 percent field estimated clay in the ash mantle."

They formed in ash over colluvium and residuum from weathered ash flow tuffs, basalt or andesite.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 35 inches, falling mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 10 to 50 days."
