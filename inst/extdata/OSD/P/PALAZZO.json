    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Palazzo soils are in valley basin floors and flood plains. Slope is 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in mixed alluvium, weathered dominantly from igneous rock. Most of this soil has been leveled, but was hummocky in its natural landscape. Elevation is 90 to 160 feet. The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. The mean January temperature is 46 degrees F; mean July temperature is 79 degrees F. and the mean annual temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F. The frost-free season is 210 to 280 days."

Alros soils, on valley basin floors, are saline-sodic and have a calcic horizon.  Bolfar and Elnido soils, on valley basin floors, have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section. Dospalos soils, on valley basin floors, have a fine particle-size control section. Escano soils, on valley basin floors, have organic matter that decreases regularly and have a calcic horizon. Kesterson soils, on valley basin floors, have a natric horizon and an ochric epipedon."

These soils were previously very poorly drained and ponded with stagnant water for extended periods during winter and spring months but are now ponded for periods of 2 to 7 days from December to February in some areas. The water table is now 3.5 to 5 feet from December through February in some areas. They are now artifically drained or have had their water source intercepted. They are partially protected from major flooding by large flood control levees and reservoirs. Some areas are subject to rare flooding in years of abnormally high precipitation."

These soils are being differentiated by characteristics that show a reducing environment (Aquic Moisture Regime). Additionally they have a fine-loamy texture control section and a mollic epipedon, neither of which are characteristic of Columbia soils.\nSeries reclassified 5/95. CEC added, and very slow runoff was edited to negligible to comply with new criteria in the Soil Survey Manual.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
