  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for cropland and rangeland.  About 60 percent is used for cropland, almost exclusively for rice in a rice-unimproved pasture rotation.  A few areas are used for corn and grain sorghum.  Native grasses are salt tolerant species such as gulf cordgrass, marshhay cordgrass, seashore saltgrass, low panicums, knotroot bristlegrass, and shoregrass.  Woody invaders are mostly stunted mesquite, bushy sea-oxeye, and cactus."

The classification was changed from Mollic Natraqualfs to Aquic Natrudalfs during the Soil Data Join and Recorrelation initiative. These soils do meet the requirements for aquic conditions for the Aqualfs subgroup."
