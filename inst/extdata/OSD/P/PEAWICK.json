  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Peawick series are very deep and moderately well drained with very slow permeability.  They formed in clayey fluvial sediments on stream terraces of the Coastal Plain and Peidmont.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees F, near the type location.",
