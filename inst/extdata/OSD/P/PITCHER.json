  "OVERVIEW": "The Pitcher series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium and residuum from extrusive igneous rocks.  Pitcher soils are on colluvial sideslopes at elevations of 1,600 to 2,800 feet.  Slopes are 8 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 70 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Pitcher soils formed in volcanic ash and cinders mixed with colluvium from a wide variety of extrusive igneous rocks.  The climate is maritime with cool, dry summers and mild winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 55 to 80 inches, occurring mostly as snowfall and rainfall during winter.  Mean January temperature is about 31 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 130 to 160 days."
