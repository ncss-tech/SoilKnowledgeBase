The upper 7 to 14 inches of these soils are more than 60 percent volcanic ash and pumice.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments by volume.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  It is strongly acid or moderately acid.   Some pedons have weakly developed E horizons.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist.  It is sandy loam or loam modified by 0 to 20 percent weathered hard cinders, 10 to 45 percent pebbles, and 0 to 15 percent cobbles. It is weakly to moderately smeary throughout.  It is strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7  dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist or dry.

Deroux, Littlejohn, Mountaineer, Pheeney and Umpa soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Pheeney soils have an umbric epipedon.  Scotties soils are deep to a lithic contact and are dry 60 to 75 consecutive days.  Bertolotti, Deroux, Mountaineer, Roxer and Umpa soils are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days.  Cliffdell soils are in a drier environment having 35 to 55 inches of precipitation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pitcher soils are on colluvial sideslopes at elevations from 1,600 to 2,800 feet.  The slopes are 8 to 90 percent.  Pitcher soils formed in volcanic ash and cinders mixed with colluvium from a wide variety of extrusive igneous rocks.  The climate is maritime with cool, dry summers and mild winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 55 to 80 inches, occurring mostly as snowfall and rainfall during winter.  Mean January temperature is about 31 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 130 to 160 days."

Zynbar soils are medial and have a bulk density of less than 0.85g/cc in the upper part of the control section."
