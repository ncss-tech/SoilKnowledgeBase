  "OVERVIEW": "The Plutos series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy glacial outwash from extrusive igneous rock and volcanic ash.  Plutos soils are on outwash plains and fans over fractured basalt lava flows.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact of hard fractured basalt is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 degrees to 56 degrees F.; the mean January soil temperature is 34 degrees to 37 degrees F.; the mean July soil temperature is 62 degrees to 75 degrees F.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from March 15 to December 1 and exceeds 47 degrees F. from April 15 to November 20.   The soil between the depths of 12 to 36 inches is dry from mid-July until mid-October and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  An O horizon of 1/2 inch to 2 inches thick is common under trees and shrubs.  It is assumed that the base saturation is 60 to 75 percent in some part of the upper 10 to 30 inches.  The soil is neutral to medium acid.  There are 2 to 15 percent fine to coarse (2mm to 4cm) basalt or pumice pebbles.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown or light brownish gray (10YR 5/2, 6/2; 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2).  Moist colors are very dark brown or very dark grayish brown (10YR 2/2, 3/2; 2.5Y 3/2).  It is sand or loamy sand.  Organic carbon ranges from 0.3 to 0.6 percent.\nThe C horizon is brown. pale brown, grayish brown, or light brownish gray (10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3; 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2).  Moist colors are very dark brown, very dark grayish brown, or dark brown (10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3; 2.5Y 3/2).  It is sand or loamy sand."

Delaney soils are 40 to 80 inches or more deep, to basalt flow rock.  Deetz soils are greater than 60 inches deep and have less than 60 percent base saturation.  Oosen soils are greater than 80 inches deep, have frigid soil temperature, and have less than 60 percent base saturation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Plutos soils are in collapse basins between expansion ridges of basalt lava flows.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in alpine glacial outwash mixed with volcanic ash and pumice.  Elevations are 2,800 to 4,500 feet.  Stones and cobbles are scattered over the soil surface occupying less than 0.01 percent of the area.  There are rock outcrops of lava flow expansion ridges 1 to 30 feet high and 20 to 150 feet apart.  The climate is continental and subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 16 inches.  Snowfall averages 18 to 24 inches.  Mean January temperature is 30 degrees to 34 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 65 degrees to 68 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 46 degrees to 50 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 100 to 140 days."

Vegetation consists of western juniper, manzanita, rabbitbrush, sagebrush, bitterbrush, wild currant, squaw bush, squirreltail, prairie junegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, needlegrass and annual brome grasses.  Many small areas are actively eroding by wind and are nearly devoid of vegetation."
