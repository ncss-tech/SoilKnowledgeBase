  "OVERVIEW": "The Padrones series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slow permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian deposits over loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on the Sandsheet Prairie of the South Texas Coastal Plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 in).",

Water movement through the soil is moderately slow. During normal years of precipitation, a seasonal water table perches on top of the natric horizon for brief periods of less than 1 to 2 weeks, most in the months of May to October.  In some years tropical storms or prolonged periods of above-normal precipitation result in a seasonal water table perched on top of the natric horizon for 2 to 4 weeks most usually in the months of June to October."

The climax native vegetation in excellent condition is composed of 90 percent grasses, 5 percent woody plants, and 5 percent forbs.  In excellent condition, tall and mid grasses such as seacoast bluestem, brownseed paspalum and switchgrass dominate.  Major forbs include snoutbean, arrowleaf, sida, prairie coneflower, firewheel, phlox, and ragweed. Mesquite is the dominant woody plant. The ecological site is Sandy, (R083EY706TX)."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Padrones soils were formerly included with the Nueces series.  Particle-size distribution analyses, sand/silt ratios and clay free size fractions indicate that a lithologic discontinuity occurs at the upper boundary of the natric horizon.  In 2005 this series was reclassified from Aquic Arenic Natrustalfs to Arenic Natrustalfs based on the 1989 to 2002 water table study* conducted on similar upland soils in the central part of the Texas Gulf Coast Prairie MLRA.  This soil does not have aquic conditions in most years.  In some years, reduced conditions develop just above and in the upper part of the natric horizon for brief periods following extreme above-normal precipitation events.  Redoximorphic features that result from these above-normal events are not diagnostic for classification.\n*partial data in Proceedings of eighth international soil correlation meeting (VIII ISCOM) 1992, USDA-SCS National Soil Survey Center, Lincoln, NE\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 43 cm (0 to 17 in)\nArenic feature: 0 to 71 cm (0 to 28 in)\nNatric horizon: 71 to 203 cm (28 to 80 in)\nLithologic discontinuity: 71 cm (28 in)"
