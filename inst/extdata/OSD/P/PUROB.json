  "OVERVIEW": "The Purob series consists of shallow to a petrocalcic, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone. Purob soils are on ballenas and fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 millimeters (8 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C. (53 degrees F.).",
