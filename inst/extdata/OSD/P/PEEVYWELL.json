Budlewis soils have a calcic horizon above the duripan.  Forvic soils have a Mollic epipedon that is 20 to 30 inches thick.  Hatpeak soils are calcareous in the upper part of the duripan and have clear boundaries between the A and B horizon.  Manard soils have bedrock above 40 inches.  Oshone soils have a pan less than 10 inches thick.  Rastus soils have carbonates above and in the duripan."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soil formed in alluvium and colluvium from mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rain. The average annual temperature is about 40 degrees to 44 degrees F. The frost-free season is 60 to 90 days."

Goodington soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock and occur on Lava plains.  Smelter soils have mollic epipedons greater than 20 inches thick and occur on north and east-facing foothills.  Muldoon soils have a duripan deeper than 40 inches and occur on fan terraces.  Starhope soils lack a duripan and are moderately deep and occur on south-facing and east-facing foothills.  Manard soils have bedrock between 20 and 40 inches and occur on basalt plains."
