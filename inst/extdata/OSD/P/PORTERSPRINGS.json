The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 20 to 30 percent.  Some pedons have a few calcium carbonate concretions, films, or threads below a depth of 40 inches.  Redoximorphic features are considered both contemporary and relic.  This soil does not have aquic soil conditions in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Some pedons have a few redox concentrations in shades of brown or yellow in the lower part.  The reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Redox concentrations in shades of brown or red range from few to common.  Some pedons have a few redox depletions.  Texture is mainly sandy clay loam but the range includes fine sandy loam in some subhorizons.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BCt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, chroma of 4 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of red, brown or gray range from few to many.  Some pedons have a mixed matrix with these colors.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam.  The reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has colors in shades of brown or yellow. The texture is fine sand or loamy sand.  The reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline."
