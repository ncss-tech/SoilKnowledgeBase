  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to 80 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 20 to 30 percent.  Some pedons have a few calcium carbonate concretions, films, or threads below a depth of 40 inches.  Redoximorphic features are considered both contemporary and relic.  This soil does not have aquic soil conditions in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Some pedons have a few redox concentrations in shades of brown or yellow in the lower part.  The reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Redox concentrations in shades of brown or red range from few to common.  Some pedons have a few redox depletions.  Texture is mainly sandy clay loam but the range includes fine sandy loam in some subhorizons.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BCt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, chroma of 4 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of red, brown or gray range from few to many.  Some pedons have a mixed matrix with these colors.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam.  The reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has colors in shades of brown or yellow. The texture is fine sand or loamy sand.  The reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other competing series, similar series are the Benchley, Bernaldo, Bonham, and Waskom soils.  Benchley and Bonham soils are members of a fine family.  Bernaldo soils do not have a mollic epipedon.  Waskom soils have a mollic epipedon 20 to 40 inches thick and mixed mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Portersprings soils are on nearly level stream terraces.  They are rarely flooded.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  These soils formed in alluvial sediments.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 44 inches.  Frost free days range from 235 to 245.  The elevation ranges from 145 to 220 feet above sea level.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 67 degrees F., and the Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges 64 to 72."

Kaufman soils have very-fine control sections and are on associated flood plains.  Gowker and Kosse soils are in slightly lower flood plain positions and they do not have an argillic horizon."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for cropland or improved pastureland.  Corn, small grain, and grain sorghum are the principal crops.  Pastures consist mainly of improved bermudagrass.  However, bahiagrass, fescue and legumes such as white clover, arrowleaf clover and lespedeza are well adapted.  Present tree vegetation is mainly water oak, pecan, ash and elm."
