Borland soils contain less than 5 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Yrtneg soils have vitrandic properties in the surface horizons. Jilson soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 10 to 15 degrees C, and a mean summer soil temperature of more than 20 degrees C. Laric, Malinda, and Yrtneg soils have silica capped lithic contacts. Libertybutte soils have clay content 18 to 23 percent in argillic horizon.
