  "OVERVIEW": "The Pass Canyon Series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum, slope alluvium and colluvium over fractured intermediate igneous bedrock.  These soils are on ridges, hills and mountain slopes.  Slope gradients are 4 to 60 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 8.3 degrees C, and the average annual precipitation is about 350 mm.",
