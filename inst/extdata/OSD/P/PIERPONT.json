  "OVERVIEW": "The Pierpont series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in Wisconsinan age till that is strongly influenced by clayey shale and siltstone on till plains and moraines. It is moderately deep to a fragipan. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high above the fragipan, low to moderately low in the fragipan and moderately low to moderately high in the substratum. Slope ranges from 2 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1065 mm (42 in), and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",

Aquic conditions - begin at a depth of 25 cm (10 inches).\nThe May, 2000 revision included a change in taxonomic classification, due to updates contained in the 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. The previous classification was Fine-silty, mixed, mesic Aqueptic Fragiudalfs."
