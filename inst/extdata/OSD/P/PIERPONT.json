Structure is weak to strong, fine or medium granular. Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid. Areas that have been limed range to slightly acid or neutral. The A horizon ranges to 2 in thick in some pedons.\nSome pedons have a BE or E horizon that has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Structure is weak, fine or medium subangular blocky. Rock fragments range from 0 to 3 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Clay content ranges from 24 to 35 percent. Structure is weak to strong, fine to coarse subangular blocky or prismatic. Rock fragments range from 0 to 3 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silty clay loam or clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, very coarse prismatic, sometimes parting to subangular blocky or platy. Rock fragments range from 2 to 15 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part and slightly acid or neutral in the lower part.\nThe BC horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay loam. Structure is weak, medium to very coarse, subangular blocky, or weak, thin to thick, platy. Rock fragments range from 2 to 15 percent.

The poorly drained Canadice and Sebring, somewhat poorly drained Caneadea and Fitchville soils, and moderately well drained Glenford soils are on nearby lacustrine terraces. The somewhat excessively drained Chenango, moderately well drained Blakeslee and somewhat poorly drained Red Hook soils are on nearby outwash terraces. The somewhat poorly drained Darien soils do not have a fragipan."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 inches) (Ap horizon).\n2. Argillic horizon and fragipan feature - from a depth of 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 in) (Btx1 and   Btx2 horizons).\n3. Aquic conditions - begin at a depth of 25 cm (10 inches).\nThe May, 2000 revision included a change in taxonomic classification, due to updates contained in the 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. The previous classification was Fine-silty, mixed, mesic Aqueptic Fragiudalfs.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for the Pierpont series can be found at the NCSS Soil Characterization Database.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
