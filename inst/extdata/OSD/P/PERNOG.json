  "OVERVIEW": "The Pernog series consist of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from quartzite, shale, chert, welded tuffs and rhyolite. The Pernog soils are on mountain crests and side slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

Celeridge, Genoa and Loope soils average 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Gabica soils have a mollic epipedon that does not include all parts of the argillic horizon. Gerdog, Grandeposit, Hawkridge and Rozara soils have dominantly gravel in the particle-size control section. Gidwin soils have 18 to 24 percent clay and are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days in the summer. Hutchley and Melling soils have a xeric soil moisture regime. Majorsplace soils are intermittently moist in the upper part for 10 to 20 days cumulative due to convection storms between July and September. Shalcleav and Tweener series are 10 to 30 cm deep to bedrock."
