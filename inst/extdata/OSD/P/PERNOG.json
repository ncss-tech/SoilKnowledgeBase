Celeridge, Genoa and Loope soils average 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Gabica soils have a mollic epipedon that does not include all parts of the argillic horizon. Gerdog, Grandeposit, Hawkridge and Rozara soils have dominantly gravel in the particle-size control section. Gidwin soils have 18 to 24 percent clay and are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days in the summer. Hutchley and Melling soils have a xeric soil moisture regime. Majorsplace soils are intermittently moist in the upper part for 10 to 20 days cumulative due to convection storms between July and September. Shalcleav and Tweener series are 10 to 30 cm deep to bedrock."

Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1,465 to 2,535 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 460 mm; mean annual temperature is 4 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 50 to 90 days."
