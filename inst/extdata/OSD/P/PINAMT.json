  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinamt series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fan alluvium and stream alluvium.  Pinamt soils are on fan terraces and stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 73 degrees F.",

This distinction could not be consistently recognized.  The type location was moved in 1988 to accommodate revised series separations based on depth to the base of the argillic horizon, PDC.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nRevised for the correlation of AZ661, 2/2009, WWJ"
