  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 3 inches (A1, A2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 3 to 28 inches (Btk1, Btk2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon - the zone from 3 to 60 inches (Btk1, Btk2, C horizons)\nSegregated calcium carbonate is assumed at depths of 3 to 60 inches although not described, PDC.\nPinamt and its competitors were originally differentiated on degrees of salinity.  This distinction could not be consistently recognized.  The type location was moved in 1988 to accommodate revised series separations based on depth to the base of the argillic horizon, PDC.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nRevised for the correlation of AZ661, 2/2009, WWJ\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
