These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches from 60 to 75 consecutive days in the summer and fall.  Thickness of solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches or more thick.  The control section is silt loam or silty clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 to 3 dry or moist.  It has weak or moderate platy, granular or blocky structure.  Reaction is medium acid to neutral.\nThe AB horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay.  Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky or prismatic.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral in the upper part and slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part.\nA Bt horizon is present is some pedons."

These soils formed in Late Wisconsin loess which contains some volcanic ash in the upper part.  Summers are warm and dry; winters are cool and moist.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 25 inches.  Average January temperature is 27 to 30 degrees F, average July temperature is 67 to 70 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F.  and on the average frost-free season is about 100 to 160 days."

Caldwell and Mondovi soils have irregular distribution of organic matter with depth.  Garfield soils have an ochric epipedon and have a fine argillic horizon.  Gwin soils have a lithic contact at 10 to 20 inches.  Latah and Tilma soils have a fine textured argillic horizon. Latahco soils are frigid.  Naff and Thatuna soils have an argillic horizon. Waha soils are fine-loamy and have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches."
