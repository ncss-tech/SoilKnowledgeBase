  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Palomino soils occur at elevations of 7500 to 8000 feet in a cool, subhumid climate having a mean annual temperature of 42 degrees F. to 45 degrees F. The average January temperature is approximately 25 degrees F. and the average July temperature is approximately 60 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 22 to 30 inches. The soils have formed from sandstone. They occur on nearly level to strongly sloping exposures of Coconino sandstone and sandstone members of the Kaibab formation."

(A horizon)\nArgillic Horizon - The zone from 11 to 17 inches.  (Bt horizon)\nLithic contact - 17 inches (R horizon)\nClassification changed from Haplocryalfs to frigid Haplustalfs in 2006. The change was made to be consistent with the moisture and temperature regime of the geographic extent of the soil and to be consistent with the associated soils.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
