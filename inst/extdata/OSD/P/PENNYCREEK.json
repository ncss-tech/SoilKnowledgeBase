These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the 4 months following the summer solstice.  Depth to bedrock is 4 to 10 inches.  The particle-size control section has 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume and 5 to 18 percent clay.  Base saturation by ammonium acetate is 75 to 90 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry and moist.  It is extremely gravelly sandy loam or extremely cobbly loam.  It has 2 to 6 percent organic matter.  Moist bulk density is 0.90 to 1.00 g/cc.  Acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron is 1 to 2 percent."
