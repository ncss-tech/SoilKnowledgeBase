  "OVERVIEW": "The Pennycreek series consists of very shallow to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from marine basalt and associated volcanic rocks on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 60 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 50 inches and average annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the 4 months following the summer solstice.  Depth to bedrock is 4 to 10 inches.  The particle-size control section has 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume and 5 to 18 percent clay.  Base saturation by ammonium acetate is 75 to 90 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry and moist.  It is extremely gravelly sandy loam or extremely cobbly loam.  It has 2 to 6 percent organic matter.  Moist bulk density is 0.90 to 1.00 g/cc.  Acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron is 1 to 2 percent."
