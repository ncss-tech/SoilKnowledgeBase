These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the 4 months following the summer solstice.  Depth to bedrock is 4 to 10 inches.  The particle-size control section has 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume and 5 to 18 percent clay.  Base saturation by ammonium acetate is 75 to 90 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry and moist.  It is extremely gravelly sandy loam or extremely cobbly loam.  It has 2 to 6 percent organic matter.  Moist bulk density is 0.90 to 1.00 g/cc.  Acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron is 1 to 2 percent."

Juandefuca and Maidenpeak soils are on mountain slopes and are very deep.  Slidecamp soils are on low relief dissected uplands and have an argillic horizon with less than 35 percent rock fragments.  Station soils are on mountain slopes and have a udic moisture regime."
