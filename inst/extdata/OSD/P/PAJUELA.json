Reaction is moderately alkaline to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon is pale brown, light yellowish brown, brown, or yellowish brown (10YR 6/3, 6/4, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6).  It is gravelly sandy loam, gravelly coarse sandy loam, gravelly loamy sand, and gravelly loamy coarse sand.\nThe C horizon is pale brown, light yellowish brown, brownish yellow, or yellow (10YR 6/3, 6/4, 6/6, 7/6).

They occupy intergrade areas between the aridic and xeric moisture regimes.  Elevations are 3,200 to 4,500 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool mild winters and hot dry summers.  Average annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches.  Average January temperature is 44 degrees F., the average July temperature is 83 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 200 to 250 days."

Cinco and Jawbone soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments.  Also, Jawbone soils are less than 20 inches dry to weathered rock.  Whitewolf soils occupy the lower drainageways that have been cut into the terraces of Pajuela soils."
