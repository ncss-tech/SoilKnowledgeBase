  "OVERVIEW": "The Plains series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils. The soils formed in sandy, wind-altered eolian sediments in the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These soils occur on nearly level to gently sloping plains and interdunes. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 432 mm (17 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",

This is a fragile site and is subject to severe wind erosion if not protected by cover. This soil has been correlated to the Sand Hills (R077CY034TX) range site in MLRA-77C."
