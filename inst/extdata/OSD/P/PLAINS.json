Sand paspalum, sideoats grama, hairy grama and perennial threeawn are the main mid and short grasses.  Sand sagebrush, shinoak, and skunkbush are the main shrubs.  This is a fragile site and is subject to severe wind erosion if not protected by cover.  This soil has been correlated to the Sand Hills (077CY034TX) range site in MLRA-77."
