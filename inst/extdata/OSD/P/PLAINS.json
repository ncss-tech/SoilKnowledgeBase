  "OVERVIEW": "The Plains series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils.  The soils formed in sandy, wind-altered eolian sediments in the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age.  These soils occur on nearly level to gently undulating plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F.",
