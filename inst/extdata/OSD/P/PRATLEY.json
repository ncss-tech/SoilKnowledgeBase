  "OVERVIEW": "The Pratley series consists of soils that are moderately deep over a petrocalcic horizon. They are well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in pedisediment over residuum from limestone bedrock. These soils occur on nearly level to gently sloping footslopes of ridges on dissected plateaus.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 19.4 degrees C (67 degrees F).",
