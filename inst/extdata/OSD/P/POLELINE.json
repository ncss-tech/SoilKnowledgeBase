  "OVERVIEW": "The Poleline series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in colluvium from sandstone.  Poleline soils occur on mountainsides.  Slopes are 15 to 70 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 35 inches thick.  The combined thickness of the A and B horizons ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches over bedrock.  Rock fragments are cobble and gravel size, angular or rounded sandstone, and quartzite rock fragments, and range from 35 to 75 percent in the solum.  The particle-size control section averages 12 to 18 percent clay.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 36 to 42 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F.  The soil is usually moist, but is dry in parts of the A horizon for 40 to 60 days during the late summer and early fall months.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3.  It ranges from very gravelly sandy loam to very cobbly very fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to medium acid."

Gateview, Harcany, Lolon, Snag, Povey, and Spearhead soils lack cambic horizons.  Behanin, Caballo, Campone, and Hapgood soils have more than 18 percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch particle size control section.  Belsac (T) soils have paralithic contact between 20 and 40 inches.  Marcetta soils have albic horizons.  Snopac (T) lacks a cambic horizon.  Lorta (T) has more than 60 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section.  Croesus, Dateman, Nagitsy, Namela, Nevtah and Prong soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Darland and Raynoldson (T) soils have C horizons within 60 inches.  Hobacker soils lack a cambic horizon and have visible carbonates in the series control section.  Nazaton soils have 0 horizons and are more than 60 inches to bedrock.

The climate is humid; the average annual precipitation is about 25 to 35 inches, mostly in the form of snow from October to April.  The mean annual temperature is 36 to 42 degrees F., mean summer temperature is about 58 degrees F.  The freeze-free period is about 50 to 80 days."
