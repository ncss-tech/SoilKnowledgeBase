  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinehollow series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum from red sandstone or red siltstone. Pinehollow soils are on mountain backslopes, shoulders and summits. Slopes are 2 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
