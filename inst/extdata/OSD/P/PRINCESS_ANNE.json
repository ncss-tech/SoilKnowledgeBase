Uses also include commercial fishing and crabbing.\nTypical vegetation--Vegetation is virtually absent as Princess Anne soils may contain high concentrations of porewater sulfide due to finer textures and increased organic matter. Where vegetation is present, wild celery (Vallisneria americana) and stonewort (Nitella sp.) have been observed."
