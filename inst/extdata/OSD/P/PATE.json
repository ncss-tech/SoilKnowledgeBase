  "OVERVIEW": "The Pate series consists of deep, well drained and moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed dominantly in residuum weathered from interbedded limestone (10 percent) and gray calcareous shale (90 percent) with the upper part having considerable mixing of colluvium.  Slopes range from 6 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

The well drained Eden soils are on adjacent but higher and steeper slopes formed in residuum weathered from calcareous Ordovician shale (70 percent) and limestone (30 percent) of the Dillsboro formation.  They have thinner sola and more coarse fragments in the upper part of the B horizon.  The well drained Switzerland soils are on ridgetops at higher elevations.  They have fine-silty over clayey control sections and are more acid.  The moderately well drained Nicholson soils are on ridgetops that have more gentle slopes.  They have more acid sola and a fragipan."
