Coarse fragments range from 0 to 10 percent in the upper part of the solum and from 15 to 50 percent in the lower part of the solum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 (more than 5.5 dry), and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silt loam or silty clay loam and ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The upper 20 inches is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay and averages 35 to 55 percent clay and less than 5 percent fine sand or coarser.  The rest of the Bt is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay or their channery analogues that has 35 to 60 percent clay and less than 10 percent fine sand or coarser.  It is medium acid to neutral in the upper part and slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Near the paralithic contact, there is some chroma of 1 or 2.  It is channery, flaggy, very channery, or very flaggy silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon is gray calcareous shale with interbedded limestone."

All of these soils have a solum thickness of less than 50 inches except the Jessup soil.  Jessup soils do not have gray coatings in their argillic horizon, have a solum thickness less than 60 inches, and have a mantle of loess 10 to 24 inches thick over glacial till."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pate soils are on the lower part of upland hillsides.  Slopes range from 6 to 35 percent.  The soils formed dominantly in residuum weathered from calcareous Ordovician shale and limestone of the Kope formation with the upper part having considerable mixing of colluvium.  The interbedding is about 10 percent limestone and 90 percent shale.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 46 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Eden, Switzerland, and Nicholson soils.  The well drained Eden soils are on adjacent but higher and steeper slopes formed in residuum weathered from calcareous Ordovician shale (70 percent) and limestone (30 percent) of the Dillsboro formation.  They have thinner sola and more coarse fragments in the upper part of the B horizon.  The well drained Switzerland soils are on ridgetops at higher elevations.  They have fine-silty over clayey control sections and are more acid.  The moderately well drained Nicholson soils are on ridgetops that have more gentle slopes.  They have more acid sola and a fragipan."
