  "OVERVIEW": "The Paraje series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, schist, and loess.  Paraje soils are on shoulders and beveled summits of eroded fan remnants and backslopes of low hills.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
