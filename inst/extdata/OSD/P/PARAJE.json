    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Paraje soils are on shoulders and beveled summits of eroded fan remnants and on backslopes of low hills.  They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist; and from Quaternary loess.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,600 to 7,100 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."
