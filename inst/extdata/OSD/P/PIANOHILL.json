  "OVERVIEW": "The Pianohill series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from volcanic mudflow breccia. These soils are on structural benches, lahars and hills. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.",
