  "OVERVIEW": "The Podmor series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from quartzite.  These soils are on mountainsides with slopes of 30 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
