  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Podmor soils are on concave to linear mountainsides at elevations of 7,000 to 10,000 feet.  Soils occurring at higher elevations are generally on south aspects.   The higher slopes are on southerly aspects.  Slopes range from 30 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from quartzite.  The mean annual air temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches.  The freeze-free period is 70 to 90 days."
