  "OVERVIEW": "The Penagua series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in colluvium derived from limestone.  These soils are on mountain slopes.  Slope ranges from 15 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
