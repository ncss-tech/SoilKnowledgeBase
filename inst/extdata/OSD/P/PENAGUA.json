    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Penagua series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in colluvium derived from limestone.  These soils are on mountain slopes.  Slope ranges from 15 to 35 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 54 degrees.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 18 inches.  The precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September.  The driest months are March and April.  Precipitation during the months of January, February, and March is less than 13 percent of the total.  The frost-free period is 120 to 180 days.  The elevation ranges from 4,490 to 8,660 feet."
