    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were mapped as Panoche and Lost Hills (T) in the Los Banos Area, California series 1939 report. Paver soils are being differentiated by a xeric intergrade to the aridic moisture regime and in the case of Lost Hills (T) not having a Bt horizon. Calcium carbonate equivalent determined by field HC1 double syringe kit. Organic matter determined by Walkley-Black digestion method.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric Epipedon -- the zone from the soil surface to 16 inches (A and Ap horizons), in which the organic matter content is less than 1 percent.\n2. Cambic Horizon -- the zone from 16 to 22 inches (Bw horizon). Zone of loss of carbonates.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
