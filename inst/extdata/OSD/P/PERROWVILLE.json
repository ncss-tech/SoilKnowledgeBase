  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were previously mapped as Sweetapple series. The area where Perrowville is mapped was originally mapped as thermic, and later converted to mesic.  These soils feel as if they are higher in silt content than mechanical analysis shows them to be. They have a greasy feel caused by the high mica content. The mica is dominantly soft and mineral structure is destroyed by prolonged rubbing.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 5 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)\nCambic horizon - the zone from 5 to 17 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)\nHigh content of flakes of mica in the Bt2, BC, and C horizons\nParalithic contact - contact with weathered bedrock at 39 inches (upper boundary of the Cr horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory Data: No laboratory data available.\nDatabase Information:\nTypical Pedon Data Mapunit ID82665\nUser Pedon ID--89VA019025\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
