Fang, Fruitland, and Geer soils are moist for short periods in the summer and fall and have mean annual soil temperatures of 12 to 15 degrees C.  Ganaflan, Moepitz, Vanderhoff, Wentridge, and Worland soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Jeddito, Jenrid, and Shotnick soils are intermittently moist for short periods in the summer and early fall.  Kumiva soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 11 to 13 degrees C.  Marcou soils are intermittently moist for short periods in the summer and have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR.  Mazuma soils have a Bk horizon and have exchangeable sodium percentage of 15 to 35 throughout the series control section.  Sodaspring soils contain 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Tooele soils have exchangeable sodium percentage of 15 to 35.  Trachute soils have hues redder than 10YR and have a Cy horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources with some influence from loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,985 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 145 days."
