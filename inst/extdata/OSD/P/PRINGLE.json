  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 12 to 19 inches thick.  Depth to the very gravelly sand 2C horizon ranges from 19 to 28 inches.  When the mollic epipedon is greater than 16 inches thick the depth to the contrasting 2C horizon is less than 20 inches.  The upper part of the particle size control control section averages 8 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent but less than 50 percent fine or coarse sand.  Organic matter decreases irregularly as depth increases and remains above 0.5 percent to a depth of 50 inches.  Depth to water table fluctuates with the season and ranges from 10 to more than 60 inches and is 12 to 24 inches below the surface during the period between February and June.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 67 to 69 degrees F.  The soil is dry in the 8 to 24 inch depth for 90 cumulative days but is not dry for 60 or more consecutive days during the summer.  Rock fragments are rounded gravel and cobbles, and range from 50 to 70 percent in the 2C horizons.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry,\nand chroma of 2 to 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.  It ranges from loam to silt loam.  Reaction is mildly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nThe A/C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and moist.  It has stratified layers of silt loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, and loamy fine sand.  Mottles range from common medium, prominent to common fine and distinct.  The A/C horizon is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and moist.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Steed soils lack both mottles and coarse loamy material in the upper part of the particle size control section.  Utaba soils have mollic epipedons 20 to 29 inches thick and lack mottles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pringle soils are at elevations of 4,800 to 7,000 feet.  They occur on flood plains and stream terraces and valley floors.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, quartzite, and limestone.  The climate is moist subhumid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 22 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 63 to 66 degrees F., and the freeze-free period ranges from 70 to 105 days."

Canburn, Eastcan, Redola and Sowcan soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick, and Canburn and Eastcan soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Eastcan and Redola soils are dry for more than 60 consecutive days during the summer.  All of these soils lack very gravelly sand 2C horizons in the lower part.  Irim soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section."
