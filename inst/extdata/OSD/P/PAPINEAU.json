  "OVERVIEW": "The Papineau series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy outwash or eolian deposits and in the underlying clayey lacustrine deposits or clayey glacial drift. These soils are on glacial lake plains or till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches).",

It commonly has redoximorphic features with higher chroma. Texture commonly is sandy clay loam but ranges from sandy loam to clay loam. The sand-sized grains are dominantly medium or fine. The variability of the sand indicates stratification at the time of deposition. Reaction is moderately acid in some subhorizon and ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2BCg horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is clay or silty clay, and it commonly contains a component of sand that ranges to as much as 25 percent by volume. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Cdg horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is silty clay or clay and in some pedons contains strata of coarser textures. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

In addition, the somewhat excessively drained Ade soils are on higher landform positions, and the poorly drained Bryce, Gilford, and Selma soils are on lower landform positions. The somewhat poorly drained Ridgeville soils are on similar landform positions as the Papineau soils."
