    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the base of soil development and densic contact ranges from 91 to 122 cm (36 to 48 inches). The depth to the clayey material ranges from 64 to 102 cm (25 to 40 inches). The depth to carbonates ranges from 76 to 117 cm (30 to 46 inches). The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 25 to 46 cm (10 to 18 inches).\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. It commonly has redoximorphic features with higher chroma. Texture commonly is sandy clay loam but ranges from sandy loam to clay loam. The sand-sized grains are dominantly medium or fine. The variability of the sand indicates stratification at the time of deposition. Reaction is moderately acid in some subhorizon and ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2BCg horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is clay or silty clay, and it commonly contains a component of sand that ranges to as much as 25 percent by volume. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Cdg horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is silty clay or clay and in some pedons contains strata of coarser textures. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Papineau soils are on glacial lake plains or on till plains. These upland soils have a slope gradient of 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in loamy outwash or eolian deposits and the underlying clayey lacustrine deposits or clayey glacial drift. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 1016 mm (28 to 40 inches), frost-free period ranges from 140 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 156 to 285 meters (512 to 935 feet) above sea level."

Ade, Gilford, Ridgeville, and Selma soils do not have clayey material in the lower one-half of the series control section. Bryce and Swygert soils contain more clay in upper one-half of the series control section. In addition, the somewhat excessively drained Ade soils are on higher landform positions, and the poorly drained Bryce, Gilford, and Selma soils are on lower landform positions. The somewhat poorly drained Ridgeville soils are on similar landform positions as the Papineau soils."

The depth to an intermittent perched seasonal high water table ranges from 25 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) at some time between January and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) in the loamy material and moderately low or moderately high (0.14 to 1.41 micrometers/s) in the clayey material. Permeability is moderate in the loamy material and slow or very slow in the clayey material."
