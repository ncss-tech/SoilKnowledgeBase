  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 28 to 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock or unconforming substrata is more than 5 feet.  Reaction, where unlimed, ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid.  Redoximorphic features are brown, yellow, or gray in all horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has a hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or neutral, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 0, 1, or 2.  Undisturbed areas have a thin A horizon with value less than 3.5.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam.\nThe BAg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or neutral, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 0, 1, or 2.  Texture is silt loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  It has weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky structure.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or neutral, value of 4 or 6 and chroma of 0, 1, or 2.  Texture is generally silty clay or clay, but includes silty clay loam and clay loam.  It has weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky structure, or weak or moderate, medium or coarse prismatic structure parting to subangular blocky.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, neutral, 5GY or greener, value of 4, 5, or 6 and chroma of 0, 1, 2, or 3.  Texture is generally silty clay but the range includes clay loam, silty clay loam and clay.  Some pedons contain pebbles or cobbles."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Armagh and Delila series in the same family.  The Armagh soils have more than 5 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section and are formed in residuum weathered from acid gray shale.  The Delila soils are formed in alluvium weathered fromfelsic igneous and metamorphic rocks.\nThe Albano, Baile, Brinkerton, Cavode, Colemantown, Fallsington, McGary, Othello, Prout, Roanoke, Robertsville, Shrewsbury, Tygart, Tyler and Worsham series are members of related families.  The Albano and McGary soils have base saturation more than 35 percent.  The Baile, Fallsington, Othello, Prout and Shrewsbury soils have weighted average clay content of less than 35 percent in the control section.  The Brinkerton, Robertsville and Tyler soils have fragipans.  The Cavode and Tygart soils have chroma 2 or lower in less than 60 percent of the soil volume between the Ap or A and a 30 inches depth.  Colemantown soils contain glauconite.  The Roanoke and Worsham soils have average annual soil temperature of more than 59 degrees F."
