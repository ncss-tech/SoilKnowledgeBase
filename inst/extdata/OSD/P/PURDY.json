  "OVERVIEW": "The Purdy series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in slackwater-deposited alluvial materials on terraces.  Permeability is slow or very slow.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.   Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 millimeters and Mean annual air temperature is about 10.5 degrees C.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 71 to 152 centimeters.  Depth to bedrock or unconforming substrata is more than 150 centimeters.  Reaction, where unlimed, ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid.  Redoximorphic features are brown, yellow, or gray in all horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has a hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or neutral, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 0, 1, or 2.  Undisturbed areas have a thin A horizon with value less than 3.5.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam.\nThe BAg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or neutral, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 0, 1, or 2.  Texture is silt loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  It has weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky structure.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or neutral, value of 4 or 6 and chroma of 0, 1, or 2.  Texture is generally silty clay or clay, but includes silty clay loam and clay loam.  It has weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky structure, or weak or moderate, medium or coarse prismatic structure parting to subangular blocky.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, neutral, 5GY or greener, value of 4, 5, or 6 and chroma of 0, 1, 2, or 3.  Texture is generally silty clay but the range includes clay loam, silty clay loam and clay.  Some pedons contain pebbles or cobbles."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Armagh, Delila, and Lenni series in the same family.  The Armagh soils have more than 5 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section and are formed in residuum weathered from acid gray shale.  The Delila soils are formed in alluvium weathered from felsic igneous and metamorphic rocks. Lenni soils formed in fluviomarine sediments and have a substratum with a high saturated hydraulic conductivity."
