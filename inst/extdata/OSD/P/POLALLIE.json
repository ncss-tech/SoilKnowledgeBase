The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts in the moisture control section for 15 to 45 consecutive days during summer and fall. The exchange complex is dominated by amorphous material in the particle-size control section. It has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.85 to 1.10 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of greater than 2.0 percent and 15-bar moisture retention of 10 to 12 percent.  Rock fragments in the particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent. Thickness of the spodic horizon ranges from 1 to 3 inches. Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moistand chroma of 2 to 4 dry, 1 to 3 moist.  Texture is gravelly ashy sandy loam or very stony ashy sandy loam.  It has 15 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones.\nThe Bhs horizon has  value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist, 3 to 6 dry.\nThe Bw1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 dry, 3 to 6 moist.

They formed in colluvium and residuum from Swauk Sandstone with an admixture of volcanic ash. Elevations are 3,500 to 5,500 feet. The soils are in a continental climate with cool, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 90 inches. The average January temperature is about 24 degrees F, and the average July temperature is about 58 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 39 to 44 degrees F.
