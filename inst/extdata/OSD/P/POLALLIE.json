  "OVERVIEW": "The Polallie series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium from hard sandstone, with an admixture of volcanic ash. Polallie soils are on mountain side slopes and mountaintops. Slopes are 10 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 70 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
