The soil has cracks 1 to 5 cm wide at a depth of 20 to 26 inches.  The cracks open and close once each year.  They remain open during the period of July through October and remain closed the rest of the year.  Common to many intersecting slickensides are in all or part of the Bss horizon.\nThe A and Bss horizon colors is 10YR 3/1, 4/1, 4/2, 5/1, 5/2; N3/0, N4/0, and N5/0.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 3/1; N2/0, and N3/0.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon color is 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 5/1, 6/2; and 2.5Y 4/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 4/2; and 2.5Y 3/2 moist.  They are silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay with 35 to 60 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Segregated lime occurs as soft masses or in seams.\nThe C horizon color is 10YR 4/3, 4/2, 5/3, 5/2, 6/3, 6/2; 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2, 6/2; 5Y 6/3, and 7/2.

Elevations are 2,500 to 5,300 feet. The climate is characterized as having warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 18 inches.  Seasonal snowfall is 12 to 36 inches.  Mean January temperature is 27 to 30 degrees F; mean July temperature is 67 to 70 degrees F; and mean annual temperature is 44 to 52 degrees F.
