  "OVERVIEW": "The Pit series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in fine-textured alluvium weathered from extrusive and basic igneous rocks.  Pit soils are on flood plains and in basins.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The soil has cracks 1 to 5 cm wide at a depth of 20 to 26 inches.  The cracks open and close once each year.  They remain open during the period of July through October and remain closed the rest of the year.  Common to many intersecting slickensides are in all or part of the Bss horizon.\nThe A and Bss horizon colors is 10YR 3/1, 4/1, 4/2, 5/1, 5/2; N3/0, N4/0, and N5/0.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 3/1; N2/0, and N3/0.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon color is 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 5/1, 6/2; and 2.5Y 4/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 4/2; and 2.5Y 3/2 moist.
