  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F.  Depth to  lithic contact is 12 to 20 inches.  Clay content of the particle size control section ranges from 10 to 18 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Content of rock fragments is typically less than 5 percent but may range from 0 to 15 percent channers.  In some areas this horizon has a 25 percent cover of a fine channer and lag gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Content of rock fragments is typically less than 5 percent but may range from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry and 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam or channery sandy loam.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 35 percent when averaged.  This horizon is absent in some pedons and when present is either too thin or does not contain enough pedogenetic calcium carbonate to be a calcic horizon."

Slopes are typically 0 to 4 percent but range up to 8 percent.  Elevation is 6,500 to 7,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 35 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 60 to 90 days depending upon aspect and air drainage."
