Reaction is medium acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is sand, loamy sand, or coarse sand.  Thin lenses of muck, sand, and loamy sand with chroma of 0 to 2 are usually present.  Reaction is medium acid to neutral to a depth of 40 inches and slightly acid or neutral below a depth of 40 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Erber series is the only other member of this family.  Series in closely related families are the Algansee, Cohoctah, Gilford, Glendora, Granby, Maumee, Morocco, Newton, and Watseka soils.  Erber soils have more silt and clay in the upper part of the control section, have salt and gypsum crystals, and range from neutral to strongly alkaline.  Algansee and Morocco soils are better drained and lack dominant low chroma colors in the upper part of the solum.  Cohoctah and Gilford soils are coarse- loamy.  Glendora soils lack a mollic epipedon and are less acid.  Gilford, Granby, Maumee, Morocco, Newton, and Watseka soils have a content of organic carbon that decreases regularly with increasing depth.  In addition, Newton soils are more acid, and Watseka soils are better drained."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Prochaska soils are on broad low- lying areas, in depressional areas, along drainageways, and in old stream channels on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Prochaska soils formed in sandy alluvial deposits.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 39 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 49 to 53 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Adrian, Algansee, Granby, Maumee, Morocco, and Suman soils.  Adrian soils are in more depressional areas and formed in muck over sand.  Algansee and Morocco soils are on ridges and knolls and lack mollic epipedons.  Granby and Maumee soils are on slightly higher areas and lack stratification.  Suman soils are in the same setting as Prochaska soils and have more clay in the upper part of the solum."

A few areas are used for hay and pasture.  Native vegetation was red elm, silver maple, pin oak, and river birch."
