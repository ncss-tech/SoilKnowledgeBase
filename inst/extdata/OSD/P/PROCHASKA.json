  "STATES": "IN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Prochaska series consists of deep, very poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils on flood plains.  These soils formed in sandy alluvial deposits.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Erber series is the only other member of this family.  Series in closely related families are the Algansee, Cohoctah, Gilford, Glendora, Granby, Maumee, Morocco, Newton, and Watseka soils.  Erber soils have more silt and clay in the upper part of the control section, have salt and gypsum crystals, and range from neutral to strongly alkaline.  Algansee and Morocco soils are better drained and lack dominant low chroma colors in the upper part of the solum.  Cohoctah and Gilford soils are coarse- loamy.  Glendora soils lack a mollic epipedon and are less acid.  Gilford, Granby, Maumee, Morocco, Newton, and Watseka soils have a content of organic carbon that decreases regularly with increasing depth.  In addition, Newton soils are more acid, and Watseka soils are better drained."

Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Prochaska soils formed in sandy alluvial deposits.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 39 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 49 to 53 degrees F."

Algansee and Morocco soils are on ridges and knolls and lack mollic epipedons.  Granby and Maumee soils are on slightly higher areas and lack stratification.  Suman soils are in the same setting as Prochaska soils and have more clay in the upper part of the solum."
