    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Carsitas (CA), Dalelake (CA), Joetree (CA), Lagunita (AZ), Myoma (CA) and Rositas (CA) series. Carsitas and Rositas soils do not receive appreciable summer precipitation and are generally dry throughout the moisture control section for most of the year. Joetree soils have an argillic horizon with an upper boundary between 100 and 150 centimeters. Lagunita soils have less than 15 percent gravel in the control section and are slightly or moderately alkaline throughout. Myoma soils have 2.5Y hues or yellower, are slightly to strongly effervescent throughout and contain conch and clam shells throughout the particle size control section. Dalelake soils are formed from eolian deposits and are always dominated by fine sand textures in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pintobasin soils are on fan remnants, alluvial fans, fan aprons, inset fans and in drainageways. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in mixed alluvium from dominantly granitoid rock. Elevations are 290 to 855 meters (950 to 2,805 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches); mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (63 to 73 degrees F.) and the frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."

Carrizo soils are found on similar landscape positions and have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections. Oldale soils are found on fan remnants and have an argillic horizon and a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section. Dalelake soils are on thick sand sheets and are dominated by fine sands. Joetree and Patscamp soils are on fan aprons over fan remnants and have argillic horizons within 150 centimeters of the soil surface. In addition, Patscamp soils have a calcic horizon within the lower part of the argillic."
