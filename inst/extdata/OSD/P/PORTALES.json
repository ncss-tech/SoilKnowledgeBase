  "OVERVIEW": "The Portales series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils. These soils formed in medium to moderately fine textured, calcareous, lacustrine sediments of Pleistocene age. These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping concave plains associated with playa lake basins. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 483 mm (19 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",
