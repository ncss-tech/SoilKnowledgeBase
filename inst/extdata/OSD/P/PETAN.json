They formed in residuum derived from rhyolite and basalt with some influence from loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Elevations of 1,620 to 1,740 meters.  Climate is cool and subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
