  "OVERVIEW": "The Petan series consists of shallow over duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from rhyolite and basalt.  Petan soils are on side slopes of hills, plateaus and fan piedmonts and have slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
