  "OVERVIEW": "The Pittplace series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone, mudstone, metasedimentary rocks and schist. Pittplace soils are on mountains and have slopes of 9 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2290 millimeters (90 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone, mudstone, metasedimentary rocks and schist. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 2030 to 2550 millimeters (80 to 100 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F).

Ahpah soils are 50 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) deep to a lithic contact and lack an argillic horizon. Rockysaddle soils are loamy-skeletal. Trailhead soils have parasesquic mineralogy and hues redder than 7.5YR throughout the argillic horizon. The Ahpah soils are on convex slopes and on narrow ridge crests above the Pittplace soils. The Wiregrass soils are on concave areas and on steeper slopes below the Pittplace soils. The Rockysaddle soils are on linear to convex areas on steeper slopes below the Pittplace soils. The Trailhead soils are on broad, gentler slopes above the Pittplace soils."
