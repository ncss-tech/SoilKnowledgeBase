These soils are on all hillslope positions of gently sloping to moderately steep ash fields on lava flows that are 750,000 to 250,000 years old and very steep cinder cones. Slope gradients range from 0 to 50 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over basaltic lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 1,000 to 2,300 millimeters (40 to 90 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1,020 to 1,780 meters (40 to 70 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 16 to 19 degrees C. (60 to 67 degrees F.) The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)"
