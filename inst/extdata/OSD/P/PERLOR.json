Celeton soils have 60 to 80 percent pararock fragments of diatomite in the particle-size control section.  Goldyke soils are moist in some part for 10 to 20 cumulative days in the summer and have paralithic contacts at depths of 5 to 25 cm.  Oceanet soils are moist in some part for intermittent periods throughout the summer and have rock fragments comprised mainly of soft sandstone.  Roic soils are moist in some part for 10 to 20 cumulative days in the summer and contain secondary gypsum within the profile.  Shalet soils have hue of 5YR or redder and contain secondary gypsum.  Slatery soils have less than 50 percent sand."

Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,375 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
