    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Priestlake soils are on sloping to very steep mountainous uplands at elevations of about 2,400 to 5,000 feet and have primarily a northerly aspect at lower elevations.  These soils formed in glacial till with a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  The climate is subhumid with moderately warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from about 35 to 45 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from about 40 degrees to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 50 to 90 days."

Jeru soils are loamy-skeletal and have extremely stony surfaces.  Klootch soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Treble soils have a frigid temperature regime and southerly aspects."
