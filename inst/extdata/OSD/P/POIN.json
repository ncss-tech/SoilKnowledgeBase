  "OVERVIEW": "The Poin series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from gneiss-schist, sandstone, rhyolite, granite, quartzite or welded tuff bedrock. These soils are on bedrock floored plains, hills, ridges and mountains. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
