  "OVERVIEW": "The Poorman series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in material derived from metamorphic rocks with a thin mantle of volcanic ash. They are on mountain slopes and ridges. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 1,015 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",
