  "OVERVIEW": "The Panor series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments.  The Panor soils are on relict alluvial flats.  Slopes are 2 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
