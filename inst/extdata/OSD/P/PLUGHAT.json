  "OVERVIEW": "The Plughat series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and alluvium derived from sedimentary materials.  Plughat soils are on plains and interfluves.  Slopes range from 1 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
