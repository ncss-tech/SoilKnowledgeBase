Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 7.8 to 10.6 degrees C (46 to 51 degrees F)."

All of these soils are on similar landscape positions and are distinguished from the Pardeeville soils, principally on the development of the B horizon or thickness and color of the A horizon.  Coloma soils have thinner, lighter-colored A horizons and coarser-textured sola.  Lapeer soils have somewhat thinner and lighter-colored A horizons.  Locke soils are on contiguous lower-lying sites or depressions where drainage is impeded.  Wyocena soils have lighter-colored surface horizons and coarser textures within depths of 102 cm (40 inches)."

The location in the OSD appears to be incorrect since it places the site in a wooded area and the TP has a plow layer. The location for the TUD has been used in the OSD.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
