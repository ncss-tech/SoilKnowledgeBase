  "OVERVIEW": "The Pardeeville series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in calcareous loamy sand or sandy loam glacial till on uplands. Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",

All of these soils are on similar landscape positions and are distinguished from the Pardeeville soils, principally on the development of the B horizon or thickness and color of the A horizon.  Coloma soils have thinner, lighter-colored A horizons and coarser-textured sola.  Lapeer soils have somewhat thinner and lighter-colored A horizons.  Locke soils are on contiguous lower-lying sites or depressions where drainage is impeded.  Wyocena soils have lighter-colored surface horizons and coarser textures within depths of 102 cm (40 inches)."

The location in the OSD appears to be incorrect since it places the site in a wooded area and the TP has a plow layer.
