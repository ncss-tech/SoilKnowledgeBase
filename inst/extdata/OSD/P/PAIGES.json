  "OVERVIEW": "The Paiges series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvial sediments derived from acid shale.  Paiges soils are on gentle to moderately sloping pediments underlain by bedrock and on shale dipslopes.  Slopes are 3 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the umbric epipedon is 10 to 16 inches.  The base saturation of the umbric epipedon is less than 50 percent and typically decreases throughout the control section.  Depth to acid shale bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Coarse fragments in the form of soft fine and very fine shale platelets that break down on pretreatment range from 20 to 50 percent in the A horizon and 60 to 80 percent in the C horizon.  The control section averages 0 to 15 percent hard shale channers.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F., which occurs about April 21-27, but is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days from July 1 to October 25 and for at least 90 cumulative days during this period.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is very strongly acid or extremely acid.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Textures are clay loam, clay, or silty clay with 35 to 55 percent clay.  It is extremely acid.  Some pedons contain a Bw horizon in place of the AC.  When present, it is too thin to qualify as a cambic horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Textures are clay loam, clay, or silty clay with 35 to 55 percent clay.  Hard shale channers average 0 to 15 percent, but subhorizons above shale bedrock may contain up to 30 percent channers.  It is extremely acid."

The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches, half of which falls as rain and snow in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F.
