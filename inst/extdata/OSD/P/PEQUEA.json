  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 16 to 35 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Rock fragments of limestone, phyllite, and schist range from 0 to 30 percent in the solum and from 10 to 40 percent in the C horizon. Mica content varies but increases with depth.  The solum is slightly acid or neutral.  The substratum is neutral to moderately alkaline and in some pedons contains carbonates.\nThe A horizon has hue 2.5Y or 10YR, value 3 or 4, and chroma 2 through 4.  It is silt loam, loam or sandy loam in the fine earth. The A horizon has weak fine or medium granular structure and is friable or very friable.\nThe B horizon has hue 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value 2 through 4, and chroma 1 through 4.  It is loam, silt loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth.  The B horizon has weak, fine or medium subangular blocky or platy structure.  It is friable or very friable.\nThe C horizon has hue 10YR through 5Y, value 3 or 4, and chroma 1 through 3.   It is loam or sandy loam in the fine earth.  The C horizon has weak thin or medium platy structure or it is massive.  It is friable or very friable."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dover, Galway, Nellis, and Salter series in the same family.\nDover and Nellis soils have calcareous glacial till within 40 inches and do not have the mica content of Pequea. Galway soils are formed in glacial till and are less than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Salter soils formed in stratified glacial materials and are on old glacial lake terraces and stream benches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pequea soils are on gently sloping to very steep hillsides and ridges.  Slope gradients are between 3 and 50 percent.  The soils are formed in residuum weathered from interbedded micaceous limestone, graphitic phyllite, and schist. The climate is humid and temperate with mean annual precipitation of 40 to 44 inches; average annual temperature is 50 degrees to 55 degrees F and the growing season is 170 to 200 days."
