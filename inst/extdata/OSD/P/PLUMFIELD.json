Boston soils have limestone fragments and a reaction of neutral or higher in the lower part of the series control section. Chalfont soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments of shale in the lower part of the series control section. Gudgel soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Haubstadt, Nabb, Robbs and Shakamak soils are more than 51 centimeters (20 inches) to the top of the fragipan. Pierpont soils are less than 152 cm (60 inches) to the base of the soil development and have a reaction of neutral or higher in the lower part of the series control section. Sciotoville soils formed in old alluvium on stream terraces, typically contain mica flakes and a have an argillic horizon that is not part of the fragipan or fragic layers in the upper part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Plumfield soils are on actively degrading positions on side slopes. They formed in less than 51 centimeters (20 inches) of Peorian loess (sand content less than about 8 percent); in 51 to 127 centimeters of Roxana silts (sand content 10 to 30 percent); and a mix of Roxana silts and glacial drift (20 to 50 inches) and in weathered Illinoian glacial till to depths greater than 152 centimeters (60 inches). In most cases a strongly developed Sangamon geosol occurs in the glacial till or drift. Slopes range from 5 to 18 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C (54 to 57 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 1067 to 1219 millimeters (42 to 48 inches), frost free days range from 180 to 210, and elevation ranges from 152 to 229 meters (500 feet to 750 feet) above sea level."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Plumfield soils were previously mapped as severely eroded soils that were taxadjunct to the Ava series because they lacked an argillic horizon above the fragipan. Horizon designations become difficult to discuss in the range in characteristics section because of different possibilities of parent materials. Although not required as part of the series concept, most pedons described so far have a thin mantle of Peoria loess as the upper stratigraphic unit. The next stratigraphic unit (horizon designation prefix 2 in this pedon) is Roxana silt or a mix of Roxana silt and glacial drift. This material has its lower boundary at the contact with glacial till (presumably of Illinoian age). In most places the glacial till has evidence of prior soil development, the Sangamon soil. Many of the properties of this horizon (horizon designation prefix 3 in this pedon) are inherited from the paleosol. It is believed, however, that present pedogenic processes have resulted in some properties of the Plumfield soils being super-imposed on these horizons.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 13 cm (5 inches), (Ap horizons); argillic horizon  the zone from 13 to 178 cm (5 to 70 inches), (Btx1, 2Btx2, 2Btx3, 3Btgb1, 3Btgb2 and 3Btgb3); fragipan - the zone from 30 to 91 cm (12 to 36 inches), (2Btx3 horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
