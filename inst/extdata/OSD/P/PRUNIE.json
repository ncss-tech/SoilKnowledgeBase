  "OVERVIEW": "The Prunie series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks.  Prunie soils are on mountains and plateaus.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
