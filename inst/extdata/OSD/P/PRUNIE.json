    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Prunie soils are on mountain and plateaus.  They typically occur on slightly concave footslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,830 to 2,450 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 75 days."
