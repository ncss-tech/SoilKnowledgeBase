    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid.  Some pedons have few to many fine manganese concretions throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam, loam or clay loam.\nThe Eg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or clay loam.\nThe Btg horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 through 6; and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 through 6.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of red, brown, and yellow and depletions, are common to many.  In some pedons, the lower Btg horizons are mottled in the same colors as above.  The Btg1 horizon is sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or clay loam. The Btg2, Btg3, and Btg4 horizons are clay or sandy clay.  The Btg5 horizon is sandy clay loam or sandy clay.  The control section has 35 to 50 percent clay and less than 30 percent silt.\nSome pedons have a BCg horizon with colors similar to the Btg horizon or it may be mottled in shades of red, brown, yellow and gray.  Texture is sandy clay loam or sandy loam.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has colors that are the same as in the Btg horizon or it is mottled in shades of red, brown, yellow, and gray.  It is sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam, and is often stratified."

Bladen, Leaf, and Meggett soils have an abrupt textural change between the A and B horizons.  In addition, the Meggett soils have base saturation of more than 35 percent in the B horizon.  Chickahominy soils have more than 30 percent silt in the control section.  Coxville and Grady soils have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Lenoir and Wahee soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Lumbee soils have less clay and sola less than 40 inches thick.  Ogeechee soils are less clayey.  Rembert, Roanoke, and Worsham soils have a sola less than 60 inches thick and Rembert soils have kaolinitic mineralogy."
