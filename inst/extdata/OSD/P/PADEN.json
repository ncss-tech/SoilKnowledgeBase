  "OVERVIEW": "The Paden series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils with a fragipan in the subsoil. The soil formed in 1.5 to 4 feet of silty material and the underlying older alluvium or residuum. The soils are on stream terraces, primarily those associated with the Tennessee River and its tributaries. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.",

Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid, except the surface layer is less acid where limed. Gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the Ap, Bt, and Btx horizons and 0 to 35 percent in the 2Bt horizon. Some pedons have a 2C horizon with fragments ranging from 15 to 80 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Horizons with value of 3 are less than 6 inches thick. Texture is silt loam, or silty clay loam in severely eroded pedons.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma 2 to 4. Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8 , Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe E part of the E/B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 and chroma of 1 to 3. Redoximorphic features are in shades of gray or brown. Texture is silt loam or rarely silt. The B part of the E/B horizon has the same colors and textures as the Btx horizon.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Common to many redoximorphic features are in shades of brown, red or gray. Texture is silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. It has common to many redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown and yellow, or in many pedons it may be an evenly mottled pattern with no distinct matrix color. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is clay loam, sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.\nMany pedons have a 2C horizon with colors the same as the 2Bt. Texture of the layer is variable with a significant increase in water rounded fragments. Commonly, the texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or fine sandy loam, but may range to loamy fine sand."

Series in similar families are the Bude, Calloway, Dickson, Dulac, Grenada, Lax, Loring, Olivier, Ora, Pheba, Prentiss, Providence, Sango, Locust, and Savannah series. Bude, Calloway, Olivier, and Pheba soils have gray mottles in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon or within 16 inches of the soil surface. Dulac, Grenada, Loring, and Providence soils have more than 35 percent base saturation. Dickson soils have siliceous mineralogy. Lax and soils do not have an E/B horizon and contain more than 35 percent coarse fragments within a depth of 2 to 4 feet. Nixa and Paraloma soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments throughout the B horizon and are mesic. Ora, Prentiss, Locust, and Savannah soils are fine-loamy. Sango soils are coarse-silty."
