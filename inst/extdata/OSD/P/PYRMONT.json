The poorly drained Brookston soils and moderately well drained Lewisburg soils are in a drainage sequence with Pyrmont soils. Brookston soils have mollic epipedons and are on nearly level areas or in depressions. Lewisburg soils typically are more sloping and are on higher or better drained topographic positions than Pyrmont soils. Celina and Crosby soils have thicker sola than Pyrmont soils. In addition, Celina soils are on higher or better drained topographic positions. Crosby soils are on similar topographic positions as Pyrmont soils."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Field investigations in areas previously correlated as Pyrmont series in Preble County documented the presence of soils with sola thicker than 20 inches and/or soils that are moderately well drained. Pyrmont soils in Preble County were re-correlated as Crosby-Lewisburg complex during the modernization project. A new type location for Pyrmont Series will need to be established during MLRA updating activities.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (Ap, BE horizons).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 25 to 36 cm (Bt horizon)."
