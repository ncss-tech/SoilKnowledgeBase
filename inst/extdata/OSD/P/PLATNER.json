  "REVDATE": "01/2006",
  "STATES": "CO,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Platner series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in pedisediments of Ogallala or similar age.  Platner soils are on broad table lands with slopes of 0 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 46 centimeters (18 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C. (49 degrees F.)",
