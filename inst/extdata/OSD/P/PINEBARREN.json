  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinebarren series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils on upland flats, gentle side slops and toe slopes of the Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area (MLRA 133A). They formed in fluvial material and slope alluvium over clayey Miocene-age sediments. Near the type location, the average annual air temperature is about 66 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 62 inches. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.",
