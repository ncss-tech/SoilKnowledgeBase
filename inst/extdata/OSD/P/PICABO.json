  "OVERVIEW": "The Picabo series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Picabo soils are on stream terraces and flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
