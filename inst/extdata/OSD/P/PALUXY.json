Amber, Enterprise, and Reinach soils have fine-silty control sections.  In addition, Reinach soils have mollic epipedons.  Dill, Spade, and Woodward soils are underlain by weakly to strongly cemented sandstone within a depth of 40 inches and occur in drier areas.  Hardeman soils have secondary lime within a depth of 36 inches.  Noble soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Spade and Woodward soils are also calcareous throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Paluxy soils are on nearly level to sloping uplands with mainly convex to plane surfaces.  Slopes gradients are generally less than 3 percent, but range from 0 to 8 percent.  The soil formed in medium textured eolian or alluvial material in close proximity to the channel of the Brazos River and its tributaries.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The average annual rainfall ranges from 28 to 38 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 59 degrees to 69 degrees F., and Thornthwaite P-E indices from 44 to 64."
