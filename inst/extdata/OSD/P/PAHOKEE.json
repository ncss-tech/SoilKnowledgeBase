  "OVERVIEW": "The Pahokee series consists of  moderately deep and deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in well decomposed, hydrophytic herbaceous plant remains overlying limestone bedrock on nearly level rises and/or dips in fresh water marshes and swamps.  Slopes ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1550 millimeters (61 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 24 degrees C (75 degrees F).",
