  "OVERVIEW": "The Pibler series consists of shallow and very shallow over petrocalcic horizon, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from sedimentary rocks. Pibler soils are on alluvial fans and fan remnants and have slopes of 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
