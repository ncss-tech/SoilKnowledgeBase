    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pibler soils are at elevations of 1,494 to 2,040 meters. They occur on alluvial fans, fan remnants and fan piedmont remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived from quartzite, sandstone, limestone and some basic igneous rocks. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The climate is semiarid. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C. Average annual precipitation ranges from 200 to 300 mm. Freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days."
