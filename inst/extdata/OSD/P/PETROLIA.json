    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Aetna, Canalschool (T), Nookachamps, Puget, Rafton, Skagit and Wick series. Aetna soils have a buried, dark soil at depths of less than 91 centimeters (36 inches). Canalschool (T), Nookachamps, Puget, Rafton, and Skagit soils formed in different climates and MLRAs, with typically more precipitation and at lower elevations above mean sea level. Skagit soils also have volcanic ash with glass content in the series control section. Wick soils have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 12 degrees C (54 degrees F)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Petrolia soils are on nearly level or slightly depressional parts of flood plains or on flooded parts of glacial lake plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Petrolia soils formed in light colored, moderately fine textured or medium textured alluvium. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F.), mean annual precipitation ranges from 965 to 1219 millimeters (38 to 48 inches), frost free days range from 180 to 200, and elevation ranges from 104 to 152 meters (340 to 500 feet) above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Birds, Bonnie, Karnak, Piopolis, and Zipp soils. Birds and Bonnie soils commonly are on flood plains of smaller streams or are closer to the upland source of sediments on larger flood plains and glacial lake plains. Karnak soils are farther from the stream channel or on lower-lying parts of flood plains; they contain more clay in the particle-size control section. Piopolis soils are on similar parts of flood plains nearby; they are more acidic in the control section for reaction. Zipp soils are nearby on the main body of glacial lake plains and contain more clay in the particle-size control section."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained and very poorly drained. The potential for surface water runoff is low or negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderately slow. Flooding from stream overflow is rare to frequent during late winter and early spring. In the undrained condition, these soils have an apparent seasonal high water table as much as 61 centimeters (2 feet) above the surface at some time during the year in most years. Where drained, the water table is 15 centimeters (0.5 foot) above the surface to 31 centimeters (1 foot) below at some time between November and May in normal years."
