  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Probert series consists of very deep, well drained soils.  These soils are on fan remnants and formed in mixed alluvium derived primarily from sedimentary rocks.  Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C.",
