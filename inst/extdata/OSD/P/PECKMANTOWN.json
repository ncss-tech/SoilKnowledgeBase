  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 60 inches. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Coarse fragments are commonly lacking but can range up to 15 percent in the solum and up to 35 percent in the 2C or C horizon. Unless limed, the reaction is extremely acid or strongly acid in the A horizon and strongly acid or moderately acid in the B and 2C or C horizons.\nSome pedons have O horizons up to 2 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silt, silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam, and structure is commonly very fine to medium granular but includes subangular blocky.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam, and structure is fine or  medium subangular blocky.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, and loam. Structure is weak to strong, thin to thick platy and moderate or strong, fine to medium subangular blocky. The Btx horizon is firm or very firm, and brittle.\nThe 2C or C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture is fine sand, sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction, and structure is massive to single grain. Stratification is present in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Peckmantown soils are on nearly level to moderately steep slopes on deltas and lacustrine fans. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The soil formed in glaciolacustrine materials overlying glacial outwash derived mostly from basalt, red sandstone, and granitic gneiss. The climate is humid. The mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 55 degree F. and precipitation ranges from 44 to 55 inches. Frost-free season is 156 to 184 days."

The coarse-loamy, well and moderately well drained Boonton soils formed in till on uplands. The sandy, somewhat excessively drained Knickerbocker and moderately well drained Horseneck soils lack a fragipan and argillic horizon and are on deltaic plains. The sandy-skeletal, excessively drained Hinckley soils lack a fragipan and argillic horizon and are on eskers and deltas."

    "content": "REMARKS: The Peckmantown series is proposed as a well drained soil formed in stratified medium-textured over coarse-textured sediments. It is named for a settlement along the Peckman River. Cation exchange activity class placement is based upon available data.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric Epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (A and Ap horizons).\n2. Argillic Horizon - the zone from 8 to 40 inches (BAt, Bt and Btx horizons).\n3. Fragipan - the zone from 27 to 59 inches (Btx and BCtx horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Reference samples from pedon S00NJ013-004 (1P330), samples 1P2030-2039 from Essex County, New Jersey, samples by NSSL, Lincoln, NE, 12/2000.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
