  "OVERVIEW": "The Peckmantown series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in stratified glaciolacustrine and glaciofluvial sediments. They are moderately deep to a fragipan. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Permeability is moderately rapid in the A and Bt horizons, slow or very slow throughout the fragipan and moderately rapid to very rapid in the substratum. Mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches.",

It is named for a settlement along the Peckman River. Cation exchange activity class placement is based upon available data.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric Epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (A and Ap horizons).\n2. Argillic Horizon - the zone from 8 to 40 inches (BAt, Bt and Btx horizons).\n3. Fragipan - the zone from 27 to 59 inches (Btx and BCtx horizons)."
