  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonate typically is about 18 to 20 inches, but range from 13 to 26 inches.  When the soil is dry, cracks 1/2 to 1 inch wide and several feet long extend downward through the solum.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness and extends into the Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.5 or less.  It typically is clay loam, but is loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Tongues or coatings are along vertical ped faces.  The Bt horizon is clay, silty clay, or clay loam.  It typically averages between 35 and 45 percent clay but has up to 55 percent clay in some pedons.  It has 15 percent or more fine or coarser sand.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a Btk horizon.\nThe Bk and C horizons have value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are clay or clay loam and are mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Accumulations of carbonate are few to many.  Few or common nests of gypsum are in the lower part of the C horizons in some pedons.  Mottling inherent to the parent till is common below depths of about 30 inches."

Slope gradients typically are less than 6 percent but range from 0 to 9 percent.  Peever soils formed in firm clay or clay loam glacial till.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 16 to 24 inches.  Growing season is about 120 to 140 days; average growing season precipitation from 14 to 18 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 3000."

Aastad soils have a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches thick and are in swales and lower toe slopes.  Buse soils do not have an argillic horizon and are on higher landscape positions than the Peever soils.    Cavour soils have a natric horizon and are in slightly lower positions.  Forman soils have a fine-loamy series control section and are in similar landscape positions as the Peever soils.  Hamerly soils have a calcic horizon within 16 a depth of 16 inches and are in swales or surrounding depressions.  Hattie soils do not have an argillic horizon and are on higher landscape positions than the Peever soils.  The poorly drained Parnell and Tonka soils have a fine textured series control section and are in depressions."
