  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pimer soils are on alluvial fans and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  These soils formed in recent alluvium from granite, schist, rhyolite, quartzite, shale, limestone, andesite, and basalt.  Elevations range from 70 to 2,200 feet.  Pimer soils are in a hot arid, continental climate.  The average annual precipitation is 3 to 10 inches; mean annual temperature is 67 to 75 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 240 to 350 days."

Glenbar soils are adjacent and have less than 1 percent organic matter.  Saminiego and Sasco soils are on higher stream terraces and have cambic horizons."
