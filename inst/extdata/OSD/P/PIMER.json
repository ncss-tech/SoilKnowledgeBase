  "OVERVIEW": "The Pimer series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in recent alluvium from a mixture of acid and basic igneous rocks.  Pimer soils are on alluvial fans and flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 71 degrees F.",

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pimer soils are on alluvial fans and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  These soils formed in recent alluvium from granite, schist, rhyolite, quartzite, shale, limestone, andesite, and basalt.  Elevations range from 70 to 2,200 feet.  Pimer soils are in a hot arid, continental climate.  The average annual precipitation is 3 to 10 inches; mean annual temperature is 67 to 75 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 240 to 350 days."

Glenbar soils are adjacent and have less than 1 percent organic matter.  Saminiego and Sasco soils are on higher stream terraces and have cambic horizons."

Organic matter content - It is more than 1 percent in the zone from the surface to depths of 20 to 40 inches or more.\n2.  Stratification - Soil is composed of a series of thin to thick layers of recent alluvium, with some thin strata of contrasting textures.\nType location moved to Pinal County, Arizona in 1983 to better represent the fine-silty family."
