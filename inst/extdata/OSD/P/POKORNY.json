  "OVERVIEW": "The Pokorny series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from rock gypsum derived from the Castile and Salado Formations, with alluvial and eolian inputs of silicate minerals.  Pokorny soils are on terraces, alluvial flats, and low hills of Pleistocene age. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F. (18 degrees C) and the mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches (330 mm).",

Dellahunt and Walkerwells soils are deep and occur on lower positions. Elcor and Hollebeke soils have a lithic contact within 20 inches (50 cm) of the surface and occur higher in the landscape. Hollomex soils do not have a petrogypsic horizon and occur on similar landscapes. Joberanch soils have more than 6 inches (15 cm) of silicate material above a petrogypsic horizon and occur on similar landscapes.  Niemahr soils have more than 6 inches (15 cm) of silicate material above a lithic contact and occur on lower positions."
