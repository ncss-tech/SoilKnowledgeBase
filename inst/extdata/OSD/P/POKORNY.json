  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pokorny soils are on terraces, alluvial flats, and low hills of Pleistocene age in karst. They formed in alluvium derived from rock gypsum derived from the Castile and Salado Formations, with alluvial and eolian inputs of silicate minerals.  Slope range is 0 to 8 percent.  Elevation is 4,000 to 5,500 feet (1,219 to 1,676 m).  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches (305 to 406 mm).  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 62 to 67 degrees F. (17 to 19 degrees C). The frost-free period is about 210 to 250 days."

Dellahunt and Walkerwells soils are deep and occur on lower positions. Elcor and Hollebeke soils have a lithic contact within 20 inches (50 cm) of the surface and occur higher in the landscape. Hollomex soils do not have a petrogypsic horizon and occur on similar landscapes. Joberanch soils have more than 6 inches (15 cm) of silicate material above a petrogypsic horizon and occur on similar landscapes.  Niemahr soils have more than 6 inches (15 cm) of silicate material above a lithic contact and occur on lower positions."
