  "OVERVIEW": "The Panaewa series consists of shallow, moderately well drained soils that formed in material weathered from volcanic ash which overlies pahoehoe lava.  Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent. Mean annual rainfall is about 3,900 millimeters (154 inches) and mean annual temperature is 23 degrees C (73 degrees F).",

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Panaewa soils are at elevations ranging from 0 to 366 meters (0 to 1,200 feet) on the low undulating eastern windward mountain slopes of Mauna Loa and Kilauea volcanoes. These soils are in constructional landscapes consisting of nearly level pahoehoe flows that are 500 to 11,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 10 percent. The soils formed in volcanic ash over pahoehoe lava and have had extensive mechanical manipulation. Mean annual rainfall is 3,000 to 5,000 millimeters (118 to 197 inches) with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 762 to 1,016 millimeters (30 to 40 inches).  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 21 to 25 degrees C (70 to 77 degrees F). The mean annual soil temperature is 22 degrees C or higher (72 degrees F)."
