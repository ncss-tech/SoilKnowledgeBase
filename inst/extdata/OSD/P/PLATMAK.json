  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F.  The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 145 to 192 days.  The soils are moist in some or all parts of the moisture control section from April 15 to June 15 but are dry in all parts for 60 consecutive days following July 15 and 90 cumulative days from July 15 to October 25.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent throughout. EC is less than 2 mmhos throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Those pedons that do not have an A horizon, have an E horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay or clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay with more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  A Btk is present in some pedons.\nThe Bk and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam or clay loam.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 15 percent when averaged.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

Platner soils have soil temperatures at 20 inches that are 41 degrees F. or warmer for over 192 days.  Platsher soils have gravelly substrata between 20 and 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Platmak soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, flats, plateaus, terraces, mesas and lower hills.  They formed in residuum and alluvium derived from shales.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Elevations range from 3,500 to 5,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 17 inches of which about half falls as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.   The frost-free period is about 105 to 120 days."

Absted and Arvada soils have natric horizons.  Bidman, Cambria, Cushman, Forkwood, Renohill and Ulm soils lack a mollic epipedon.  Recluse soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections.  Absted, Arvada, Bidman, Cambria, Forkwood, Platscher, Recluse and Ulm soils occur on similar positions.  Cushman, Jonpol and Renohill soils occur on shoulders and summits on hills and ridges."
