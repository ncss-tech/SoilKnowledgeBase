  "REVDATE": "06/2002",
  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Platmak series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and local alluvium derived from shales.  These soils occur on alluvial fans, fan remnants, flats, plateaus, terraces, mesa tops and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 145 to 192 days.  The soils are moist in some or all parts of the moisture control section from April 15 to June 15 but are dry in all parts for 60 consecutive days following July 15 and 90 cumulative days from July 15 to October 25.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent throughout. EC is less than 2 mmhos throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Those pedons that do not have an A horizon, have an E horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay or clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay with more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  A Btk is present in some pedons.\nThe Bk and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam or clay loam.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 15 percent when averaged.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline."
