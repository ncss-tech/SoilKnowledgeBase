Exchangeable sodium ranges from 15 percent to more than 35 percent in the natric horizon.  Depth to carbonates and their abundance is variable and they are not everywhere present.

Texture is silt loam.  Clay content is 18 to 27 percent and sand content is less than 15 percent and includes iron-manganese nodules and concretions.  Reaction typically is slightly acid or neutral, but ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Eg horizon has value of 4 or 5 (6 or 7 dry) and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically has platy structure, but in some pedons it is granular or subangular blocky.  Texture is silt loam.  Clay content is 18 to 27 percent and sand content is less than 15 percent and includes iron-manganese nodules and concretions.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe second part of the control section (Btg) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic masses of iron accumulation in the matrix have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 8.  It commonly has columnar or prismatic structure that parts to angular or subangular blocky.  The Btg horizon is silty clay loam or silty clay.  Clay content averages 35 to 43 percent and sand content is less than 10 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid to strongly alkaline in the upper part and slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline in the lower part.\nThe third part of the control section (BCg) has the same range of colors as stated for the Btg horizon.  Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam.  Clay content averages 20 to 35 percent and sand content is less than 15 percent.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe lower part of the control section (Cg or 2Cg, where present, and 2Ab and/or 2Bb, where present) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Clay content averages 20 to 35 percent and sand content averages 10 to 40 percent.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Cg horizon that is underlain by buried horizons of older soils, and other pedons do not have a Cg horizon; where the modern soil is welded to a strongly developed paleosol contained in the Illinoian till."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Piasa soils are on broad, nearly level interfluves on the Illinoian till plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils contain a concentration of exchangeable sodium.  These soils formed in 40 to 72 inches of loess.  The material beneath the loess is Illinois till or the silty pedisediment that lies above the till and contains a component of sand.  The loess is late Wisconsinan Peoria Loess and the underlying silty material is early Wisconsinan Roxana Silt.  The soils are underlain at depths of about 4 to 7 feet by Illinoian till that commonly contains a strongly developed paleosol.  Mean annual temperature 54 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation 36 to 40 inches, frost-free period is 180 to 200 days, and elevation is 400 to 700 feet above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cisne, Cowden, Darmstadt, Ebbert, Herrick, Huey, Oconee, Tamalco, and Virden soils.  The associated soils, except for Darmstadt, Huey, and Tamalco soils, do not have a natric horizon.  The poorly drained Cisne and Huey soils formed in generally thinner loess and have a 2B horizon.  The somewhat poorly drained Darmstadt soils are on convex summits and are in small drainageways.  The poorly drained Ebbert soils have a mollic epipedon and are in depressions.  The somewhat poorly drained Herrick and Oconee soils are on slightly higher landform positions.  The moderately well drained Tamalco soils are typically deeper to the natric horizon and are on convex summits and drainageways nearby.  The poorly drained Virden soils have a mollic epipedon and are on broad interfluves nearby.  Piasa soils are adjacent to and in a complex intermingled pattern with Cowden and Herrick soils."

    "content": "REMARKS:  The Piasa series was previously classified as fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Typic Natralbolls and later as fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Mollic Natraqualfs.\nThe typical pedon was resampled and described to 80 inches for this revision.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - from the surface of the soil to a depth of 12 inches (Ap and Eg horizons).  Albic horizon - from a depth of 8 to 12 inches (Eg horizon).  Natric horizon - from a depth of approximately 12 to 37 inches (Btng, Btkng1, Btkng2, Btkng3, and Btkng4 horizons).  Aquic conditions - periodic saturation and reduction indicated by redoximorphic features throughout the soil.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Data for the typical pedon is published in the Soil Survey of Montgomery County, Illinois, 1969.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
