    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:   Pharo soils are on alluvial fans, ballenas, and fan piedmont remnants.  Slopes are 1 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in deep alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary and some igneous rocks.  Elevation ranges from 1,310 to 2,135 meters in Utah and to 2,350 meters in Nevada.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C., and the mean summer temperature is 18 to 20 degrees C.  Average annual precipitation is 300 to 380 mm.  Freeze-free period is about 100 to 150 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 18 cm (A1 and part of the A2 horizons).\nCalcic horizon - the zone from 20 to 152 cm (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm. (part of the Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).\nRidge top and mountain slope landforms were removed from the series concept in the June 1993 update.  Ridge top and mountain slope landforms are inconsistent with the alluvial fan, fan piedmont remnant, and ballena landforms.  One out of nine correlated map units uses the ridge top and mountain slope landforms.  That one map unit was correlated in the Beaver-Cove Fort Area, Utah in 1971.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
