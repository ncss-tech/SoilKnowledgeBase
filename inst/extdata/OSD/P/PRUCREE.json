Dipcreek soils are shallow to bedrock and have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section.  Vipont soils have an argillic horizon.  Dipcreek soils are on similar landscapes as Prucree, but are on slightly higher convex slopes.  Suryon soils are on foot slopes, terraces and in concave areas generally below Prucree soils.  Vipont soils are on similar landscapes to Prucree and are generally south-facing."
