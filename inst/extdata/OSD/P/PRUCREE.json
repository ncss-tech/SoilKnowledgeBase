  "OVERVIEW": "The Prucree series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum, slope alluvium and alluvium from sandstone.  They are on ridges, mountainsides, and hillsides.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Prucree soils have slopes of 4 to 30 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

Dipcreek soils are shallow to bedrock and have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section.  Vipont soils have an argillic horizon.  Dipcreek soils are on similar landscapes as Prucree, but are on slightly higher convex slopes.  Suryon soils are on foot slopes, terraces and in concave areas generally below Prucree soils.  Vipont soils are on similar landscapes to Prucree and are generally south-facing."
