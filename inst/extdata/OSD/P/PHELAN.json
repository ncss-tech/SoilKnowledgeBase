Depth to redox features is 8 to 15 inches. The solum has andic soil properties with moist bulk density of 0.50 to 0.90 g/cc, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron is 2 to 4 percent, phosphate retention is 85 to 100 and 15-bar water is 25 to 35 percent on air-dried samples. Acid oxalate iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent. The solum has 2 to 3 cmol/kg of aluminum. Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid. The depth to the cemented material is 10 to 20 inches. The content of coarse fragments in the control section is 35 to 70 percent.\nThe A horizon is in 10YR to 5YR hue, range in values of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma from 2 to 4 dry. It is medial silt loam or medial loam and is gravelly to extremely gravelly, cobbly to extremely cobbly; has weak to moderate granular structure.\nThe BA horizon is 7.5YR to 2.5Y hue, range in values of 4 or 5 moist, and chroma from 2 to 4 moist. It is silt loam or loam and is gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly, or very cobbly; and is massive.\nThe Bsm horizon is weakly to strongly cemented, hue is 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist, and chroma from 1 to 3 moist."

The regolith consists of glacial outwash and colluvium over compacted till. These soils occur in a cool, wet coastal climate having an annual precipitation of 120 to 170 inches, most of which falls as rain during the fall, winter and spring months. The average January temperature is 39 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 39 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F. The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 200 to 230 days."
