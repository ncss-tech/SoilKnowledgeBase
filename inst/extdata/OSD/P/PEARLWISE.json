  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pearlwise soils are on rock pediments, mountains, and lava plateaus. They typically occur on north-facing slope positions. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt with surficial deposits of loess. Slopes are 2 to 65 percent. Elevations range from 1,425 to 2,015 meters. The climate is characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 460 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 80 days."
