  "OVERVIEW": "The Pearlwise series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed mainly in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt. Pearlwise soils are on rock pediments, mountains, and lava plateaus. Slopes are 2 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

The climate is characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 460 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 80 days."
