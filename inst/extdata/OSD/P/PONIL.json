    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 to 46 degrees F.  and the summer soil temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F.  The solum is 18 to 34 inches thick.  Rock fragments in the profile range from 5 to 25 percent by volume.  The A1 horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is stony loam, stony sandy clay loam, or stony clay loam.  This horizon is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  The B21t horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is clay or silty clay and has 5 to 25 percent rock fragments.  This horizon has moderate to strong subangular and angular blocky structure.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  The B22t horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has common distinct mottles in some pedons, with chroma of 4 through 6.  This horizon is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  The C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y.  It is usually mottled with chroma of 4 through 6.  This horizon is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  Interbedded sandstone and shale is at depths of more than 40 inches."

Crow soils have strong prismatic structure in the B horizon and an A&B horizon.  Dargol, Lakoa, Lubrecht and Ordnance soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Depew soils have an A&B horizon.  Fuera soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  Ponil soils are on sides of mountains at elevations of 7,000 to 8,500 feet.  Slopes range from 10 to 35 percent.  The soil formed mostly in colluvial deposits derived from sandstone and shale.  The climate is continental.  The mean annual temperature is 39 to 44 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 58 to 63 degrees F. The annual precipitation is 16 to 19 inches with about 60 percent falling during the frost free season."
