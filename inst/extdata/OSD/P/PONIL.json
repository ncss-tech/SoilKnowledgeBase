  "OVERVIEW": "The Ponil series consists of deep or very deep well drained soils that formed in colluvial deposits derived from sandstone and shale. These soils are on sides of mountains and slopes are 10 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
