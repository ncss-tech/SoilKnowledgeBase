Greystoke and Jumbo soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to paralithic contact. Moreglade soils do not have O horizons and have an argillic horizon with a lower boundary below 40 inches. Sherval soils have a lithologic discontinuity between 24 and 60 inches and are dry for more than 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Smarts soils have an argillic horizon with a lower boundary below 40 inches and 35 to 85 percent rock fragments in the PSCS of sandstone or quartzite origin. Toncana soils have hues of 2.5YR through 7.5YR in the Bt horizons, an argillic horizon with a lower boundary below 40 inches and 35 to 60 percent rounded rock fragments of quartzite origin."

These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium from basalt and fine pyroclastic materials. Slopes range from 8 to 25 percent. The average annual precipitation is 24 to 34 inches. The average annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."
