  "STATES": "OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pawhuska series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed predominantly in clayey material weathered from interbedded sandstones and shales of Permian age. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on treads of paleoterraces in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Mean annual precipitation is 860 mm (34 in), and mean annual air temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",
