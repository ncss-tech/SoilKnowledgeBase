  "OVERVIEW": "The Pultney series consists of moderately deep well drained soils that formed in material high in carbonates and gypsum, which weathered from highly gypsiferous shale.  These gently sloping to moderatly steep soils are on upland.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 36 centimeters (14 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C. (54 degrees F.) at the type location",
