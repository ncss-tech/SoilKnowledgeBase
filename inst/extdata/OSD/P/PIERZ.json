  "OVERVIEW": "The Pierz series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a loamy mantle over sandy and gravelly sediments.  They are on outwash plains and valley trains, glacial moraines, and stream terraces.  This soil has moderate or moderately rapid permeability in the upper loamy mantle and rapid or very rapid permeability in the underlying sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 43 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 26 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the gravelly underlying sediments ranges from 22 to 40 inches.  The upper part in the series control section contains 0 to 15 percent gravel by volume and the underlying sediments contain 15 to 60 percent gravel.  The series control section average is greater than 8 percent rock fragments.  The mollic epipedon is 8 to 16 inches thick.\nThe A or AB horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is sandy loam or loam, but includes fine sandy loam.  It is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR with value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sandy loam, loam, fine sandy loam, and coarse sandy loam.  Few to many clay films are on faces of peds.  It is slightly acid to strongly acid.  Some pedons have 2Bt or 2BC horizons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 10YR with value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It typically is very gravelly coarse sand, but includes gravelly coarse sand and gravelly sand.  Some pedons have subhorizons of coarse sand, and sand.  It is slightly acid to strongly acid."
