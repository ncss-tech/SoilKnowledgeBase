  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 36 to 38 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperatures range from 40 to 42 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The thickness of the solum ranges from 16 to 40 inches.  Clay content of the particle-size control section averages 6 to 18 percent.  The soil is noncalcareous throughout, and soil reaction ranges from moderately acid through neutral.  Rock fragments average 35 to 60 percent in the particle-size control section and are pebble sized, but in some pedons up to 50 percent may be stones.  The soil moisture control section is dry in some part less than one-half the time when the soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture is commonly sandy loam or loam.\nThe C horizon, if present, has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, chroma of 2 through 6.  It is commonly loamy sand, sandy loam or loam."

Frindle soil has a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  Hughes soils lack bedrock above 40 inches, but have a 2C horizon of very stony silt loam at 10 to 20 inches.\nLonghike soils are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 45 or more consecutive days from late July to October.  (Zeric moisture regime.)\nMurial soils are 20 to 40 inches deep over calcareous siltstone.\nTarghee soils are usually moist when the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.  Yankeefork soils lack bedrock above 40 inches and also have sandy-skeletal materials in the C horizon at 28 to 60 inches."
