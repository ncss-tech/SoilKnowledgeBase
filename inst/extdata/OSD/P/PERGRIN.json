  "OVERVIEW": "The Pergrin series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived mainly from granite, igneous volcanic materials, and sandstone.  This soil is on mountain backslopes and ridges.  Slope ranges from 10 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 640 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 3 degrees C.",

Frindle soil has a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  Hughes soils lack bedrock above 100 cm, but have a 2C horizon of very stony silt loam at 25 to 50 cm.\nLonghike soils are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 45 or more consecutive days from late July to October.  (Zeric moisture regime.)\nMurial soils are 50 to 100 cm deep over calcareous siltstone.\nTarghee soils are usually moist when the soil temperature at 50 cm is greater than 5 degrees C.  Yankeefork soils lack bedrock above 100 cm and also have sandy-skeletal materials in the C horizon at 71 to 150 cm."
