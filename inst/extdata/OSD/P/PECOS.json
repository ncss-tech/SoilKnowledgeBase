  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 16 inches (Ap horizon)\nFluventic feature - Organic carbon decreases irregularly with depth.\nVertic feature - Linear extensibility exceeds 6 cm within 40 inches of the surface.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.\nClassification was changed from Haplustolls to Torrifluvents in 1991.   The change was based on analysis of climatic data, geographic distribution and soil physical properties.  The soil is moist in the epipedon for less than 90 cumulative days in 7 out of 10 years during the growing season.  Classification change from Typic to Vertic subgroup based on NSSL characterization data from Loving county, Texas (S91TX-301-035).  The soil cracks from the surface to below 20 inches.\nWhen the competing series section was updated in September 2001, questions were raised about the description and/or the classification of this series. It was suggested that this soil should classify in the subgroup of Sodic Haplocambids. A field study of the type location is recommended to resolve the questions.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
