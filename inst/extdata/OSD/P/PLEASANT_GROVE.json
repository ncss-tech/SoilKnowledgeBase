  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is more than 20 inches thick. The mean annual silty temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F. Clay minerals are mixed, but strongly montmor-illonitic. The soils are not usually dry, but are dry in the 7 to 20 inch section for more than 45 consecutive days. They are neutral to moderately alkaline and moderately to strongly calcareous. Lacustrine sediments are at depths of 40 to 60 inches in some pedons. The Al horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is stony or cobbly loam with 20 to 50 percent rock fragments. The Cca horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, dry value of 4 through 7, moist value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is light loam or sandy loam with more than 50 percent rock fragments by volume. Lime content ranges from 15 to 88 percent and cementation may occur with the higher lime contents. A calcic horizon immediately underlies the mollic epipedon. Below 40 inches the C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is light loam or sandy loam with 50 to 80 percent rock fragments."

They formed in materials derived from limestone, shale, and minor amounts of quartzite parent rocks. The climate is dry subhumid. Mean annual temperature is 49 to 52 degrees F., average summer temperature is 70 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches. The frost free period is 150 to 170 days."
