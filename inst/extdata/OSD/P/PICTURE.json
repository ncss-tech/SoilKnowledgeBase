  "OVERVIEW": "The Picture series consists of deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable, clayey soils that formed in residuum weathered from mafic rocks, commonly diabase in dikes and sills.  These soils are on nearly level upland flats and depressions in Triassic areas of the Piedmont uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F. near the type location.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Picture series was originally classified as fine, montmorillonitic, thermic Abruptic Agriaquolls but was changed in 1991 to Typic Argiaquolls based on transects and laboratory data from four pedons.  The mineralogy of Picture soils by X-ray diffraction is marginal between mixed and montmorillonitic.  However, CEC values per 100 grams of clay exceeds 50 throughout the control section and the CEC/clay ratio ranges from 0.5 to 0.9 for the type location.  Available COLE values of the subsoil ranges from 0.10 to 0.15.  This data indicates mineralogy would best be placed in a montmorillonitic family.  The classification was changed in 1993 to Vertic Argiaquolls based on changes in taxonomic criteria for \"Vertic\" subgroups issued in the 1992 Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 17 inches (A, AB, and Btg1 horizon)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 7 to 31 inches (Btg1, Btg2, and BCg horizons)\nSIR = NC0216        MLRA = 136\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization data is available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory for the type location (S86NC-077-001) and three additional pedons (S86NC-077-002; S86NC-077-003; and S88NC-077-005).\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nNC0216 PICTURE     0-  3   59- 71  184-226  38- 50   300- 450\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nNC0216 NONE          0.5-1.5  PERCHED  NOV-APR  40-60   SOFT\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nNC0216  0- 7  L FSL SL                0-  1  75-100  7-27  15- 25\nNC0216  0- 7  CL SCL                  0-  1  75-100 27-40  15- 30\nNC0216  0- 7  GR-L GR-FSL GR-SL       0-  5  60- 75  7-27  15- 25\nNC0216  7-31  C CL SC                 0-  1  75-100 30-60  25- 45\nNC0216 31-49  CL SCL SL               0-  1  75-100 15-30  25- 45\nNC0216 49-62  WB                       -       -      -      -\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
