Mottles, if they occur, are in shades of brown, yellow, olive, or gray.  Texture of the BC horizon is clay, sandy clay, silty clay, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Cg horizon is saprolite, and has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2; or hue of N, value of 4 to 8.  Mottled pedons dominantly have chroma of 2 or less.  Mottles, if they occur, are in shades of brown, yellow, olive, or gray.  Texture is sandy clay, silty clay, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, is saprolite and has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8, or may be mottled in shades of these colors.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown, yellow, olive, or gray.  Texture of the C horizon is sandy clay, silty clay, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered, multicolored mafic rock.  It is commonly diabase.

These soils formed in materials weathered from mafic rocks, commonly diabase in dikes and sills.  The average annual rainfall ranges from 38 to 50 inches, the frost-free season ranges from 184 to 226 days, and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 59 to 71 degrees F."

Creedmoor soils are moderately well drained to somewhat poorly drained and have mixed mineralogy.  They formed in Triassic material adjacent to the mafic dikes and sills that Picture soils formed in.  Enon soils are well drained and have mixed mineralogy.   Iredell soils are moderately well drained and have montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Orange soils are moderately well drained to somewhat poorly drained.  All these soils are on higher landscape positions than Picture soils."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Picture series was originally classified as fine, montmorillonitic, thermic Abruptic Agriaquolls but was changed in 1991 to Typic Argiaquolls based on transects and laboratory data from four pedons.  The mineralogy of Picture soils by X-ray diffraction is marginal between mixed and montmorillonitic.  However, CEC values per 100 grams of clay exceeds 50 throughout the control section and the CEC/clay ratio ranges from 0.5 to 0.9 for the type location.  Available COLE values of the subsoil ranges from 0.10 to 0.15.  This data indicates mineralogy would best be placed in a montmorillonitic family.  The classification was changed in 1993 to Vertic Argiaquolls based on changes in taxonomic criteria for \"Vertic\" subgroups issued in the 1992 Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 17 inches (A, AB, and Btg1 horizon)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 7 to 31 inches (Btg1, Btg2, and BCg horizons)\nSIR = NC0216        MLRA = 136\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization data is available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory for the type location (S86NC-077-001) and three additional pedons (S86NC-077-002; S86NC-077-003; and S88NC-077-005).\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nNC0216 PICTURE     0-  3   59- 71  184-226  38- 50   300- 450\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nNC0216 NONE          0.5-1.5  PERCHED  NOV-APR  40-60   SOFT\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nNC0216  0- 7  L FSL SL                0-  1  75-100  7-27  15- 25\nNC0216  0- 7  CL SCL                  0-  1  75-100 27-40  15- 30\nNC0216  0- 7  GR-L GR-FSL GR-SL       0-  5  60- 75  7-27  15- 25\nNC0216  7-31  C CL SC                 0-  1  75-100 30-60  25- 45\nNC0216 31-49  CL SCL SL               0-  1  75-100 15-30  25- 45\nNC0216 49-62  WB                       -       -      -      -\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
