  "OVERVIEW": "The Prida series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks and volcanic ash.  The Prida soils are on alluvial flats, channels, lake plains, flood plains and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
