Mean annual rainfall is 2,032 to 3,048 millimeters (80 to 120 inches), with about 75 percent of the rainfall occurring between October and April.  Mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1,016 to 1,397 millimeters (40 to 55 inches).  The mean annual air temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C. (54 to 57 degrees F)."
