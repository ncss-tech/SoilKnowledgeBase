  "OVERVIEW": "The Piihonua series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from volcanic ash. Piihonua soils are on uplands and have slopes of 0 to 35 percent. The mean annual rainfall is about 2,032 millimeters (80 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C. (55 degrees F.).",
