  "OVERVIEW": "The Perchas series consists of deep, poorly drained soils formed in materials over Tertiary clays.  They are gently sloping to moderately steep soils on foot slopes and rolling hills of the tropical uplands.  These soils are dark grayish brown clay in the A horizon, light gray, gley in the cambic and C horizons.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 14 to 26 inches.  Texture is clay in the whole profile.  Consistence is slightly sticky or sticky and plastic.  Structure is weak, fine to coarse subangular blocky in the cambic horizon.  Reaction is strongly to extremely acid throughout.  Organic matter content decreases regularly with depth.  The mean annual soil temperature is 75 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hues of 7.5YR or 10YR, values of 4 or 5, and chromas of 1 to 2.  Mottles are gray, greenish gray or dark greenish gray.  Structure is weak or medium subangular blocky.\nThe B horizons are gleyed with 60 percent or more by volume of the matrix as low chroma.  Hues are 5Y, 10YR, or 2.5Y, values of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Structure is weak, fine to coarse subangular blocky.\nThe C horizon is also gley with hues of 2.5Y, 5Y, or 10YR, chroma of 2 or less in more than 60 percent by volume of the matrix."

The Bajura, Coloso, Corcega, Fortuna, Guayabota, Igualdad, Jareales, Pinones, Reparada, Santoni, Talante, Vayas and Vigia series are similar soils in related families.  Maunabo soils have coarser textured lower horizons.  The Bajura and Santoni soils have horizons with COLE values of more than 0.09 in their profiles.  The Coloso, Corcega and Talante soils are better drained and have less than 60 percent by volume of the upper 30 inches with low chroma mottles.  The Corcega and Talante soils have coarser textured  profiles.  The Fortuna and Vayas soils have organic matter content that does not decrease regularly with depth.  The Guayabota soils are shallow to the rock and have colder mean annual soil temperatures.  The Igualdad are coarser textured in the lower horizons and are less acid.  The Jareales, Pinones, Reparada and Vigia soils all have organic layer with their profiles."
