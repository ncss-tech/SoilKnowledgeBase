  "STATES": "IN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Potawatomi series consists of moderately well drained soils that formed in loess and in the underlying paleosol in residuum weathered from interbedded sandstone, siltstone, and shale on narrow summits of hills. These soils are very deep to bedrock and deep to a fragipan. Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12.8 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
