    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Potawatomi soils are on narrow summits of hills. Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. They formed in loess and in the underlying paleosol in residuum from interbedded sandstone, siltstone and shale. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11.1 to 13.9 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free days range from 170 to 200. Elevation ranges from 105.2 to 305 meters (345 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

The moderately deep, well drained Berks and Gilpin soils are on backslopes. The somewhat poorly drained Patricksburg soils are on summits. The Solsberry soils are on shoulders of dissected till plains and are moderately deep to a fragipan. The well drained Tulip soils are on the lower part of backslopes. The well drained, more permeable Wellston soils are on shoulders and backslopes. The moderately well drained Zanesville soils are on shoulders and backslopes."

The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) between December and April in normal years. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) in the upper part of the solum and low to moderately high (0.07 to 1.41 micrometers/s) in and below the horizons with fragic soil properties or a fragipan. Permeability is moderate (0.6 to 2 inches per hour) in the upper part of the solum and very slow or slow (0.01 to 0.2 inches per hour) in the lower part. The potential for surface water runoff is high."
