Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments in the control section average 35 to 75 percent.  The umbric epipedon ranges from 16 to 30 inches thick.  The A1 horizon ranges from very dark brown (10YR 2/2) to very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2).  The A2 horizon is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) or dark brown (10YR 3/3) when moist and grayish brown (10YR 5/2) or brown (10YR 5/3) when dry.  It has weak granular or very fine subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is very gravelly loam or sandy loam with less than 18 percent clay.  The Bw horizon is similar to the A2 horizon but is structureless and commonly has chroma of 3 moist and value of 3 or 4 moist below a depth of 16 inches.  It is sandy loam or loam with 50 to 75 percent rock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Prong soils have mountainous topography at elevations of 4,000 to 6,000 feet; slope is 20 to 100 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium mixed with rock fragments overlying intermediate igneous bedrock.  Kinds of rocks are dacite tuff, andesites, diorites, and others.  Rock outcrops are common in some of the steepest areas.  The climate is subhumid with cool wet winters and warm dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 70 inches.  This occurs as rain in the spring and fall and snow and rain in the winter months.  The mean annual temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F.; the mean January temperature is 25 degrees F.; and the mean July temperature is 52 to 64 degrees F.  The frost free season ranges from 40 to 80 days."
