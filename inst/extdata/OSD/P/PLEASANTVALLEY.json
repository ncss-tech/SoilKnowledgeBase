  "OVERVIEW": "The Pleasantvalley series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till with a thin mantle of mixed volcanic ash. These soils are on moraines, foothills, and mountain slopes in glaciated valleys. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
