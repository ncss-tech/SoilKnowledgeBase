  "OVERVIEW": "The Pikeville series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in gravelly and loamy marine sediments on Coastal Plain uplands.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 52 inches.  Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent.",
