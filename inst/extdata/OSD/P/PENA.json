  "OVERVIEW": "The Pena series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in alluvial deposits derived from igneous and sedimentary rocks.  These soils are on bajadas, terraces and knolls with slopes ranging from 0 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
