Recent washes and arroyos have dissected the old sediments.   Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent.  Elevations are 4,300 to 7,800 feet.   Pena soils occur in a semiarid climate.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 17 inches with a maximum during July, August, September and October.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 180 days."
