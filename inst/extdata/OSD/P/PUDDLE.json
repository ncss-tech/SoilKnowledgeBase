  "OVERVIEW": "The Puddle series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks over lacustrine sediments. Puddle soils are on lake plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
