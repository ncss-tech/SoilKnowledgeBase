The soils formed in loamy alluvium superimposed over lacustrine sediments derived from mixed rock sources. These sediments have been influenced by evaporation of carbonate-rich ground waters. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm. The mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C and the frost-free season is 120 to 150 days."
