  "OVERVIEW": "The Puzzlebark series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and slope alluvium derived from tuff and tuff-breccia. Puzzlebark soils are on structural benches. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
