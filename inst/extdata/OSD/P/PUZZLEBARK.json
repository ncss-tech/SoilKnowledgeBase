  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Puzzlebark soils are on structural benches. They formed in volcanic ash and slope alluvium derived from basaltic tuff and tuff-breccia. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Elevations range from 1,345 to 1,485 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 280 mm, with an annual snowfall of about 530 mm. The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7degrees C. The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

Prior to designation as a Research Natural Area by the Bureau of Land Management, ponderosa pine was commercially harvested in the Lost Forest. The present vegetation is a forest canopy of ponderosa pine and western juniper with an understory of antelope bitterbrush, mountain big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, Thurber's needlegrass, and Sandberg's bluegrass."
