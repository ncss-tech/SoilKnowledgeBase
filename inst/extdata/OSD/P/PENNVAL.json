  "REVDATE": "03/2005",
  "STATES": "PA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The PENNVAL series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium from interbedded shale and siltstone, or sandstone on footslopes of prominent valley ridges. Permeability is moderate in the upper solum and moderately slow to moderately rapid in the lower solum. Slope ranges from 15 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
