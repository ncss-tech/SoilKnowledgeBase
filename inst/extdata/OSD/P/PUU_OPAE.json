Halawa soils have 5YR or 7.5YR hue in the A horizon and strong structure and thin clay films throughout the argillic horizon.  Ioleau soils have isohyperthermic temperature and a B horizon that is very compact in place.  Kalae soils have an ochric epipedon, and strong structure and thin clay films in the argillic horizon.  Kanepuu soils are neutral or slightly acid throughout the solum and have 5YR hue in the A horizon and 5YR or 7.5YR hue in the B horizon.  Kemoo soils are slightly acid or neutral throughout the solum, have a base saturation of more than 50 percent in the B horizon, and strong structure throughout the argillic horizon."
