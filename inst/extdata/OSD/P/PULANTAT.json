  "OVERVIEW": "The Pulantat series consists of well drained, slowly permeable soils that are\nshallow over limestone. They are on upland plateaus and hills, and formed in\nresiduum derived from argillaceous coralline limestone. Slopes range from 3 to\n60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 90 inches, and the mean\nannual temperature is about 79 degrees F.",
