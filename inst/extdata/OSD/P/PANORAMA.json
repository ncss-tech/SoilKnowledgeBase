Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid through strongly acid unless limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Thin A horizons, where present, have value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 through 2.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silt loam.\nThe upper Bt horizon has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 4 through 6.

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Panorama soils are on broad, gently sloping to strongly sloping convex drainage divides in the Culpeper Basin of the Northern part of the Piedmont Plateau.  These soils formed mainly in residuum of red Triassic and Jurassic interbedded silt stones and fine grained sandstones.  A capping of transported materials may be present in some pedons and is generally less than 20 inches thick. Slope gradients range from 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F and mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 44 inches."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Laboratory data for the typifying pedon is available from the Virginia Tech Soil Survey Lab.  Panorama soils were formerly mapped as either Bucks, Penn, or Birdsboro soils.  Birdsboro soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans, may be subject to flooding, and have less than 35 percent base saturation in the chemical control section.  Bucks soils have less than 35 percent base saturation in the chemical control section and bedrock from 40 to 60 inches.  Penn soils have bedrock between 20 and 40 inches and have more rock fragments.\nREVISED = 2/18/2004, MAV added active ce activity class. Also, removed periglacial statements and the required discontinuity.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
