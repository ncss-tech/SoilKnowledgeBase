  "OVERVIEW": "The Povertyflat series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from rhyolite and andesite.  Povertyflat soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
