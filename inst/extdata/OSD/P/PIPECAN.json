Arizo, Bigbernie and Dragonwash soils are moist from 10 to 20 days cumulative in the soil moisture control section following summer convection storms in July through September. In addition, Bigbernie soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Dragonwash soils also include mainly gravel, with over half less than 5 millimeters in size. Jean soils are moderately or strongly alkaline and typically contain visible secondary carbonates as coatings on rocks or as masses in the control section. Kokan soils are moist periodically in the upper part of the control section for more than 20 days cumulative during July through September."
