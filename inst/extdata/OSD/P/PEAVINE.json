  "OVERVIEW": "The Peavine series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in clayey colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone, siltstone, basalt, tuffaceous rock, and shale. These soils occur on mountains. Slopes are 2 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 75 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The soil is usually moist and is dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for less than 45 consecutive days in the four-month period following the summer solstice in most years. The particle-size control section is 40 to 60 percent clay with 0 to 5 percent total rock fragments and 0 to 50 percent pararock fragments. The solum is 20 to 40 inches thick over firm, fractured, partially consolidated sandstone, siltstone, basalt, tuffaceous rock, or shale that commonly is consolidated below 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silty clay loam with 27 to 40 percent clay. It has 0 to 5 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent paragravel. Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid. . The surface layer may have weakly smeary or moderately smeary consistence when the soil is derived from igneous parent materials.\nAn ABt or Bat horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 4 to 8 moist and dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silty clay, or clay with 40 to 60 percent clay. It has 0 to 5 percent gravel, 0 to 50 percent paragravel and 0 to 10 percent paracobbles.

Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silty clay, or clay with 40 to 60 percent clay. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 50 percent paragravel and 0 to 10 percent paracobbles. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Crt horizon consists of partially weathered, fractured sandstone, siltstone, basalt, tuffaceous rock, or shale with the fractures filled with the fine-earth materials from the horizon above.

Absaquil and Skookumhouse soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic bedrock contact. In addition, Absaquil soils have hue yellower than 5YR in the particle-size control section. Hazelcamp soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact and lack rock fragments throughout the solum. In addition, Hazelcamp and Skookumhouse soils have 35 to 45 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Apt, McDuff, and Wintley soils have an isotic mineralogy family class. In addition, Apt and Wintley soils are deeper than 60 inches to bedrock. Wintley soils have a very gravelly 2C horizon at a depth of 40 inches or more and dominated by rounded rock fragments.of alluvial origin. McDuff soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact and have hue yellower than 5YR in the argillic horizon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Peavine soils occur on summits, shoulder slopes and backslopes of mountains. Elevations are 200 to 2,800 feet. Where these soils are mapped in the Oregon Coast Range elevations are typically 200 to 1,800 feet and reach heights of 2,600 feet in the more southern portions of the range in SW Oregon. Where these soils are mapped in the Oregon Cascade Range the typical elevations are 700 to 2,400 feet, and range up to 2,800 feet in the most southern geographic extent of the Cascades. Slopes are 2 to 75 percent. The soils formed in clayey colluvium and residuum derived primarily  from sandstone, siltstone, or shale but also includes weathered basalt or tuffaceous rock. The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 55 to 90 inches. The mean January temperature is 37 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 65 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 55 degrees F. The frost-free season is 145 to 240 days."

Ead and Melby soils lack an argillic horizon. Apt and McDuff soils have hues of 10YR or 7.5YR in the particle-size control section. Honeygrove soils are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock. Olyic soils have less than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Shivigny soils are clayey-skeletal."
