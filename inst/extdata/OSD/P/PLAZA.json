  "OVERVIEW": "The Plaza series consists of moderately well to imperfectly drained (medial) Noncalcic Brown soils (see remarks) developed from moderately fine textured alluvium from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks.  They occur on the nearly level lower edges or very gently undulating fingers of older alluvial fans extending into basin areas under annual grasses and forbs.  Characteristically the Plaza soils have about light brownish gray, medium textured, slightly acid A horizons; light olive brown, moderately fine textured, neutral Bt horizons; and mottled light gray and light yellowish brown, somewhat coarser textured, calcareous C horizons.  The Plaza soils occur along the west side of the Sacramento Valley where they are used for a variety of irrigated crops including rice.\nThe Plaza soils occur at elevations below 175 feet in a dry subhumid, mesothermal climate having a mean annual rainfall of 15 to 25 inches, with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters; an average January temperature of about 45 degrees F.; and average July temperature of about 80 degrees F.; a mean annual temperature of about 62 degrees F.; and a frost free season of about 260 days.\nThe Plaza soils occur in the same general area as the Capay, Sunnyvale, Tehama, and Willows soils, occupying intermediate positions between the well drained Tehama soils and the poorly drained Willows soils in basin positions.  They resemble the well drained Codora, Esparto, Jacinto, Tehama, and Wyo series and the poorly drained Willows.  In addition the Codora soils have grayish brown (10YR hue) sola; the Esparto soils developed in medium textured alluvium and have 10YR hues; the Jacinto soils developed in moderately coarse textured alluvium; the Tehama soils are noncalcareous and developed in medium textured alluvium; and the Wyo soils developed in medium textured alluvium.  The Willows soils are fine textured, grayish brown or gray soils containing varying amounts of alkali salts.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The A horizons range in color from light brownish gray to grayish brown (2.5Y and 10YR hues); in texture, from silt loam to clay loam or silty clay loam; and in reaction from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizons are light olive brown to light yellowish brown (2.5Y hue) and pale brown to yellowish brown (10YR hue); clay loam or silty clay loam but distinctly finer textured than the A horizon; and neutral to mildly alkaline.\nC horizon colors range from light gray to light olive brown (2.5Y or 5Y hues), are moderately fine textured, and moderately or strongly alkaline.  The lower B and C horizons are calcareous, lime being segregated in soft and hard masses and disseminated.  Nearly all of the Plaza soils have been used for rice or irrigated pasture which has caused these areas to have more acid and more mottled surface horizons than in unirrigated areas.  Slightly and moderately alkali-affected areas interfinger into alkali basin areas. The lower B and upper C is weakly cemented with silica and lime in places.  Fluctuating high water tables are common within the upper C horizon depending upon the season and nearness to flooded rice fields."
