  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The A horizons range in color from light brownish gray to grayish brown (2.5Y and 10YR hues); in texture, from silt loam to clay loam or silty clay loam; and in reaction from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizons are light olive brown to light yellowish brown (2.5Y hue) and pale brown to yellowish brown (10YR hue); clay loam or silty clay loam but distinctly finer textured than the A horizon; and neutral to mildly alkaline.\nC horizon colors range from light gray to light olive brown (2.5Y or 5Y hues), are moderately fine textured, and moderately or strongly alkaline.  The lower B and C horizons are calcareous, lime being segregated in soft and hard masses and disseminated.  Nearly all of the Plaza soils have been used for rice or irrigated pasture which has caused these areas to have more acid and more mottled surface horizons than in unirrigated areas.  Slightly and moderately alkali-affected areas interfinger into alkali basin areas. The lower B and upper C is weakly cemented with silica and lime in places.  Fluctuating high water tables are common within the upper C horizon depending upon the season and nearness to flooded rice fields."

All of the Plaza soils currently mapped occur in rice producing areas and consequently water tables persist for longer periods than would be expected under natural conditions."
