  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact over the dense till ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Free calcium carbonate typically is absent to depths of 60 inches or more inches, but in a few pedons very small amounts are in the lower part of the C horizon.  Rock fragments of mixed lithology, but mostly of igneous type, comprise 2 to 15 percent volume in the upper part and 5 to 20 percent of the lower part of the control section(Cd horizon).  Some pedons have O horizons as much as 8 inches in thickness. The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches in thickness.  Reaction in the upper part of the control section ranges from moderately acid to neutral and moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part (Cd horizon). The 10- to 40-inch particle size control section averages between 12 and 18 percent clay and 40 and 65 percent fine sand and coarser.  Stony phases are recognized in some pedons.\nThe A horizon typically has hue of 10YR to 5Y; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or is N 2/0 or N 3/0.  However, in some pedons the O horizon and those A horizons that are very high in content of organic matter have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR.  They are loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe upper part of the Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1, or hue of 2.5Y or 5Y and chroma of 1 or 2.  The lower part of the B horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is coarse sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam, or loam, but it has subhorizons of silt loam in some pedons.  It has a bulk density ranging from 1.5 to 1.7 gm/cc.\nThe Cd horizon and BC horizons, where present, have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  They are coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam or their gravelly analogues.  Some pedons have 2B and 2C horizons. It has bulk density ranging from 1.8 to 2.0 gm/cc."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Adolph, Nokasippi and Parent series.  However, when formerly classified as Typic Haplaquolls, the competing series were Forada, Runeberg, and Tiffany series.  Adolph soils have greater than 80 percent passing the 200 sieve in the upper part of the control section.  Forada soils have sand and gravel at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Nokasippi soils have sandy textures in the upper part of the particle-size control section.  Parent soils have bulk densities greater than 1.7 gm/cc in the lower part of the control section.  Runeberg soils have hue yellower than 7.5YR in the C horizon.  Tiffany soils have free carbonates at depths of 20 to 40 inches and hue yellower than 7.5YR in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Prebish soils have plane or concave slopes on upland flats in shallow depressions and swales.  They are on glacial moraines and in depressions between drumlins.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 1 percent.  The Prebish soils formed in modified till or local wash over reddish brown or brown dense loamy glacial till of late Wisconsin age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 30 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 150.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 670 to 1450 feet."

They are on higher or more sloping positions on the landscape and are better drained.  The Milaca soils are well drained; the Mora soils are moderately well drained; the Ronneby soils are somewhat poorly drained; and the Parent soils are poorly drained.  The Flak, Brainerd, and Nokay soils are also associated with Prebish soils in some places."

Permeability is moderately slow to moderately rapid in the upper part and very slow in the dense till.
