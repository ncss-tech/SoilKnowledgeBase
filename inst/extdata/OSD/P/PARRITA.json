    "content": "REMARKS:  Parrita soils were formerly included in a shallow phase of the Goliad series. The series type location was moved from Jim Wells County ( from the intersection of U. S. Highway 281 and Texas Highway 44 in Alice; 9.5 miles north on U. S. Highway 281; 0.5 mile west on County Road 235; 59 feet north in native pasture) to Goliad County in December 2008 during the correlation of Goliad County.  A study of the taxonomic unit and random pedons for survey areas where the series is correlated revealed that the majority of the areas correlated as the Parrita series have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.\nAdditional Comments:\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from other soils on the same geologic formation\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 25 cm  (0 to 10 in).  (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon: 15 to 46 cm  (6 to 18 in).  (Bt and Btk horizons)\nPetrocalcic horizon: 46 to 84 cm (18 to 33 in). (Bkm horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Particle-size analysis was performed at the project office on 13 pedons.\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
