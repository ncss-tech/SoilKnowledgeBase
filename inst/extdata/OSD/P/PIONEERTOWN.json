  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Schiefflin (AZ), Stranger (CA), and Toquerville (UT) series. Schiefflin soils receive greater than 300 millimeters of precipatation and have an ustic-aridic soil moisture regime, typical of the Sonoran Desert. Stranger soils have a typic-aridic soil moisture regime and a mean annual soil temperature of 19 to 22 degrees C. Toquerville soils are formed in eolian material derived from sandstone, are 36 to 50 centimeters to hard sandstone bedrock, have hues of 2.5YR to 5YR and have 0 to 15 percent rock fragments."

Elevation is 1097 to 1768 meters (3,600 to 5,800 feet). The climate is arid bordering on xeric with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 250 millimeters (5 to 10 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 13 to 17 degrees C (55 to 62.5 degrees F). The frost free season is 210 to 270 days."
