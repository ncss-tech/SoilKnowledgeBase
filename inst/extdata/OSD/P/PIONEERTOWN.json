  "OVERVIEW": "The Pioneertown series consists of very shallow and shallow soils, excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum from granite. The Pioneertown soils are on backslopes of hills. Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 175 millimeters (7 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Schiefflin (AZ), Stranger (CA), and Toquerville (UT) series. Schiefflin soils receive greater than 300 millimeters of precipatation and have an ustic-aridic soil moisture regime, typical of the Sonoran Desert. Stranger soils have a typic-aridic soil moisture regime and a mean annual soil temperature of 19 to 22 degrees C. Toquerville soils are formed in eolian material derived from sandstone, are 36 to 50 centimeters to hard sandstone bedrock, have hues of 2.5YR to 5YR and have 0 to 15 percent rock fragments."
