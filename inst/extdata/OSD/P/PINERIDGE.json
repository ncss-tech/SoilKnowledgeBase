  "OVERVIEW": "The Pineridge series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly or poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from granitic rocks. The Pineridge soils are on flood-plain steps of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1000 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
