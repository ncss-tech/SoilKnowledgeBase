    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth of soil is 60 inches or more.  Some pedons have dark colored buried horizon below a depth of 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry or 2 to 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.  This horizon is typically calcareous and moderately alkaline.  In some pedons, it is noncalcareous and ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline in the upper 10 inches.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry or 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The control section has strata of fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam with thin layers of coarser or finer material (7 to 18 percent clay).  Below a depth of 40 inches the texture is typically fine sandy loamy or loamy fine sand but thin layers of finer or coarser material occur."

Soils in similar families are the Asa, Comoro, Cyril, Gerlane, Grabe, Keokuk, Spur, Toyah, Waldeck, and Yahola series.  Asa soils have a fine-silty control section.  Comoro, Cyril, and Grabe soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick.  Gerland soils have regular decrease in organic carbon.  Keokuk soils have a coarse-silty control section.  Spur and Toyah soils have a fine-loamy control section.  Waldeck soils have wetness mottles within a depth of 40 inches from the surface.  Yahola soils have a ochric epipedon."

They are occasionally or frequently flooded for very brief periods during spring or summer months.  The soil formed in predominantly loamy alluvium.  The climate is subhumid.  Mean annual temperature is 57 to 64\ndegrees F.; average annual precipitation is 28 to 40 inches; Thornthwaite annual P-E indices of 44 to 64.  Frost free days range from 190 to 230.  Elevation ranges from 700 1200 feet."
