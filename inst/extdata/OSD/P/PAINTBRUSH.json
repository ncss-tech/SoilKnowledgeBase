  "BYREV": "Rev. KOD-RLT",
  "REVDATE": "03/2006",
  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Paintbrush series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on uplands.  These soils formed in a thin mantle of loess or colluvium and the underlying loamy and clayey residuum from limestone.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 9 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the 2Btx horizon ranges from 18 to 40 inches.  Chert gravel by volume is 0 to 10 percent in the A and Bt horizons, 15 to 55 percent in the 2Btx horizon, and 5 to 20 percent in the 3Bt horizon.  Chert cobble by volume is less than 5 percent in the Ap and Bt horizons, ranges to 40 percent in the 2Btx horizon and is less than 10 percent in the 3Bt horizon.  Gravel plus sand coarser than very fine averages more than 15 percent in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam or loam.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.  An E horizon is present in pedons that have not been cultivated.  Some pedons have a BE horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Mottles with higher value and chroma are usually present.  Mottles with chroma of 2 or less occur within 30 inches of the soil surface.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction is slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe 2Btx horizon has mottled colors with hue of 10YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 8.  It is gravelly, very gravelly, extremely gravelly, cobbly, very cobbly, and extremely cobbly analogues of silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Chert gravel is often horizontally oriented and there is variable moderately expressed brittleness in the fine material.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8, with mottles of lower chroma in some pedons.  It is clay or silty clay or their gravelly or cobbly analogues.  Reaction is medium acid to neutral."

These soils formed in a thin mantle of loess or colluvium and the underlying loamy and clayey residuum from limestone.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 42 inches."

Bahner soils have less sand and more clay in the series control section and are lower in the landscape.  Friendly and Maplewood soils have more clay in the series control section and are on concave sideslopes at higher elevations.  Eldon soils average more than 35 percent gravel and cobble in the series control section and are on lower sideslopes."

Reaction and density of the 2Btx were inconsistent with the concept of fragipans.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 9 inches (Ap horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from 9 to 65 inches (Bt1, Bt2, 2Btxl, 2Btx2, 2Btx3, 3Bt1 and 3Bt2 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
