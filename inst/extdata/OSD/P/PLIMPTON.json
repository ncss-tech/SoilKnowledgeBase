  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Plimpton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium on fan remnants, outwash plains and alluvial fans.  These soils are subject to prolonged saturation from flood irrigation. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
