It is dry in all parts for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F.\nDepth to the duripan ranges from 6 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section is 18 to 27 percent clay and 5 to 30 percent pebbles.  The depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Textures are loam, gravelly loam, or gravelly sandy loam.  It is moderately calcareous or strongly calcareous and mildly or moderately alkaline.\nA Bw horizon is present in some pedons.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR, value is 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma is 2 or 3.  It is gravely sandy loam or gravelly loam.\nThe Bqk horizon has value of 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam, gravelly loam, or gravelly sandy loam.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bqkm horizon is weakly cemented to indurated.  If not continuously indurated, it has indurated subhorizons."

(Expected to be reclassified to this family).  Arritola soils have 0 to 5 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section.   Besslen soils are 24 to 40 inches deep to basalt bedrock.  Chiara soils have 5 to 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Coltroop soils are 30 to 35 inches deep to bedrock.  Crooked soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section and are somewhat poorly drained.  Frohman soils have less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser in the particle size control section.  Minveno soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.  Nevoyer soils are 7 to 20 inches to bedrock. Otoole soils have less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser in the particle size control section, lack rock fragments, and are somewhat poorly drained.  Peeko and Yahoo soils have less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser in the fine earth part of the particle size control section.  Scoon soils have 6 to 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Tenvorrd soils do not have rock fragments in the particle size control section."

The soils formed in alluvium from tuffaceous limestone, sandstone, igneous rock, or quartzite.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F.  The freeze-free period is 100 to 160 days."

The precipitation comes when the soils are cool or cold.\nClassification was changed from Xerollic Durorthids to Xeric Haplodurids in 9/94\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.
