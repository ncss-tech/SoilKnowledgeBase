  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinehurst series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed colluvium weathered from andesite, volcanic breccia or tuffs.  Pinehurst soils are on uplands and have slopes of 1 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist but is dry during the summer months for 45 to 70 consecutive days or more in all parts between 4 and 12 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  Base saturation is less than 75 percent in some parts of the upper 30 inches of the solum. Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  There is a stone line at the upper boundary of the Bt horizon in some pedons.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 through 4 dry.  It is loam or stony loam.  It has 15 to 25 percent clay. It has 0 to 20 percent stones and cobbles and 0 to 15 percent gravel.  It has 2 to 4 percent organic matter.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay and partially weathered rock fragments ranging from 5 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles or stones.  The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon has less than 35 percent rock fragments.  The lower part is very stony in some pedons.  It is strongly or moderately acid."

Bauscher soils lack an O horizon, are slightly acid, have formed in weathered granite and are high in medium and coarse sands and are coarse sandy loam in the lower part of the argillic horizon and the C horizon.  Brinegar soils have a water table at depths of 36 inches in early spring, depth to mottles ranges from 30 to 45 inches, and lack an O horizon. De Masters soils lack an O horizon, have a mollic epipedon 30 to 55 inches thick.  Bringmee soils lack an O horizon, are moderately acid to neutral and have significant amounts of ash in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Watchabob soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact."
