  "OVERVIEW": "The Poganeab series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived from sedimentary and igneous rocks. These soils are on flood plains, drainageways, valley floors, and lower alluvial fans and have slopes that range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 250 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C",
