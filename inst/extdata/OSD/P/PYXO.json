  "OVERVIEW": "The Pyxo series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed from sandstone, siltstone or shale on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 9 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 178 mm (7 inches) and mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C. (62 degrees F.).",
