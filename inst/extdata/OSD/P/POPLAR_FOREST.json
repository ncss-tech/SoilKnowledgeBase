  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 50 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 6 feet. Content of coarse fragments, mainly gravel, ranges from 0 to 25 percent in the A and E horizons and is 0 to 15 percent in the lower horizons. Content of mica ranges from few to many in the A, E, BE, and BA horizons; common or many in the Bt horizon; and many in the BC and C horizons. The soil is moderately acid to very strongly acid throughout, except where the surface has been limed. Limed soils are moderately acid or slightly acid in the upper part.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam, in the fine-earth fraction.  Eroded pedons are sandy clay loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BA or BE horizons, where present, have hue of 10R to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. They are sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3\nto 8. Some pedons may have thin subhorizons of the Bt horizon that range to 5YR and do not have mottles. Texture is clay, sandy clay or clay loam.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma\nof 3 to 8. In some pedons it is mottled in shades of red, yellow, or brown. It is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10R to 10YR, values of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8 or is mottled with these colors. In some pedons it is mottled in shades of red, yellow, or brown. It is saprolite of mica schist, mica gneiss, or other high-grade metamorphic or igneous rocks that are high in mica content. Textures are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam. Locally, streaks or veins of soft quartz mica schist may be near the surface giving an irregular lower boundary to the Bt horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Soils in the same family are Clifford, Fairview, Nathalie, Toast, Westfield, and Woolwine.  Clifford, Fairview, Nathalie, and Toast soils lack more than 20 percent mica flakes that produce a characteristic slick or greasy feel.  Westfield soils are deep to bedrock.  Woolwine soils are moderately deep to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Poplar Forest soils are on gently sloping to steep uplands of the mesic Piedmont. Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent, but are mostly between 4 and 15 percent. The soils formed in residuum weathered from felsic or intermediate, high-grade metamorphic or igneous rocks high in content of mica. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from about 40 to 65 inches."

Clifford, Fairview, Nathalie, Toast, Westfield, and Woolwine soils are on similar landscape positions underlain by felsic, metamorphic or igneous rocks that are lower in mica content than the rocks from which Poplar Forest forms. The moderately well drained Halifax soils have mixed mineralogy and are on toe slopes, at the heads of drains, and along small drainageways. Huddleston soils are fine-loamy.  Chester and Glenelg soils are fine-loamy and are typically on side slopes. Elioak soils are not kandic, and are on similar landscape positions as Poplar Forest.  Perrowville soils are coarse-loamy and are moderately deep to soft bedrock."

Shortleaf and loblolly pine were present in places and are now common, along with Virginia pine, in abandoned fields."
