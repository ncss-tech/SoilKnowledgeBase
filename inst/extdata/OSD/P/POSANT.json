Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent. Elevation ranges from 8,000 to 10,400 feet; at higher elevations it is on south aspects.  Average annual precipitation is 15 to 24 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 63 to 65 degrees F.  The frost free period is 65 to 80 days."
