  "OVERVIEW": "The Posant series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from quartz latite.  These soils are on hills, ridges, and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
