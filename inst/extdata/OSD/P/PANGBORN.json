  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  The difference between mean winter and mean summer temperature is 12 to 16 degrees F.  These soils are usually saturated with water unless drained.  Fibers are mostly from grasses and sedges, but pedons contain up to 15 percent woody fragments.  The control section is dominated by sapric material.  Fiber content ranges from 30 to 80 percent, 2 to 12 percent rubbed.  Thin discontinuous layers of volcanic ash and diatomaceous earth (1/2 to 2 inches thick) occur between 24 and 48 inches in some pedons.  Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid throughout.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5 YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 4 moist, 2 through 5 dry, and chroma of 0 through 3 moist and dry."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in herbaceous and woody organic deposits.  Pangborn soils are in a marine climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Snow cover is intermittent.  Average annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches.  Mean January temperature is 35 degrees F; mean July temperature is 62 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 150 to 190 days."
