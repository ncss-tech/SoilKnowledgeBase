  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches inches.  The texture of the solum is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or cobbly analogs of these textures. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the solum and from 0 to 20 percent in the substratum. Cobble content ranges from 0 to 35 percent throughout. Stone and boulder content ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout.  Reaction of the solum ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid, and the substratum is medium or slightly acid.\nSome pedons have Oa and/or Oe horizons composed of well decomposed or partially decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and chroma of 2 or 3.  The Bs horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.\nSome pedons have 2C horizons with hue of 7.5YR; value of 5, and chroma of 3 to 5. They are gravelly sandy loam or gravelly fine sandy loam.\nThe underlying bedrock is igneous or metamorphic."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Freda, Hogback and Lyman series in the same family and the Michigamme soils. Freda soils contain shale channers throughout the profile and are underlain by shale or siltstone bedrock. Hogback and Lyman soils are in areas having more precipitation available to the soil moisture control section.  Michigamme soils have granitic bedrock at 20 to 40 inches."
