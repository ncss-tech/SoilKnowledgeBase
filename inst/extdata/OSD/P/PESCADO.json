  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The eolian materials and the underlying basalt are deposits from the Quaternary period. Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 6400 to 7000 feet. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 53 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches. The frost free period is 115 to 135 days."
