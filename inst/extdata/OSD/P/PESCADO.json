  "OVERVIEW": "The Pescado series consists of very shallow and shallow to basalt, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in eolian materials. Pescado soils are on lava flows on valley floors. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
