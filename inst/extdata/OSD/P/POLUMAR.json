Ireland soils are moderately deep to bedrock and have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick.  Manila soils are on terraces and hills below Polumar soils.  Manila soils have a fine particle-size control section and slow permeability.  Povey soils are on north facing slopes above Polumar soils.  Povey soils are leached free of accumulations of calcium carbonate."
