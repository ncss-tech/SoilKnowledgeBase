The soils formed in alluvium from mixed igneous sources with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 46 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
