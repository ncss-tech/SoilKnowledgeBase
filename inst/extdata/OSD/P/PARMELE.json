  "OVERVIEW": "The Parmele series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed igneous sources. Parmele soils are on stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
