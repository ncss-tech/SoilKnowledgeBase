    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is greater than 72 inches. Fragments of chert 1/4 inch to 4 inches across range from 25 to 50 percent in the A and BE horizons. Fragments of chert 1/2 inch to 6 inches across range from 35 to 90 percent in the Bt horizon.Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe BE or E horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 or 6. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Below a depth of 30 inches, most commonly below 40 inches the fine earth fraction includes clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown, yellow, or red. Texture is clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in residuum from cherty limestone, the uppermost layers are often affected by soil creep.  The mean annual temperature is about 58.3 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 52.3 inches near the type location."

The Fullerton soils, on adjacent sideslopes and ridgetops, are clayey and have less than 35 percent chert fragments. Bodine soils are on similar landscapes and do not have clay in the lower subsoil. Minvale soils, on footslopes and benches, formed in loamy colluvium and have less than 35 percent chert fragments."
