  "OVERVIEW": "The Pearl series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy and loamy outwash on outwash plains and stream terraces.  Permeability is rapid in the sandy layers and  moderately rapid in the loamy layer. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 8 percent throughout.  Reaction ranges from neutral to very strongly acid throughout. The control section averages between 6 and 12 percent clay and between 76 and 85 percent fine sand or coarser.  Carbonates are absent to a depth of 60 inches or more. Redox accumulations and saturation occur within 40 inches. Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less occur below a depth of 30 inches in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is loamy sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 , and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is loamy sand or sand.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.   Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt2 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.
