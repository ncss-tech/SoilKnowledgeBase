  "OVERVIEW": "The Pearl series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy and loamy outwash on outwash plains and stream terraces.  Permeability is rapid in the sandy layers and  moderately rapid in the loamy layer. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
