Depth to the base of soil development ranges from 30 to 52 inches. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy mantle and from 0 to 30 percent in the Bt and C horizons.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 8 percent throughout.  Reaction ranges from neutral to very strongly acid throughout. The control section averages between 6 and 12 percent clay and between 76 and 85 percent fine sand or coarser.  Carbonates are absent to a depth of 60 inches or more. Redox accumulations and saturation occur within 40 inches. Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less occur below a depth of 30 inches in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is loamy sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 , and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is loamy sand or sand.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.   Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt2 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.
