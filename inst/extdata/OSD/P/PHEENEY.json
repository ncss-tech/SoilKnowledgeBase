These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from andesite and breccia with an admixture of volcanic ash and pumice.  Average annual precipitation is 55 to 85 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 32 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 61 degrees F, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.  The growing season (28 F) is 140 to 190 days."
