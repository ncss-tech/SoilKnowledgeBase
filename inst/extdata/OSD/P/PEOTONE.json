Chehalem, Derrynane, and Southbrook soils average greater than 20 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Clamo soils have carbonates within a depth of 76 cm (30 inches). Okoboji soils average more than 10 percent fine and coarser sand in the particle-size control section. Rantoul and Wabash soils average more than 45 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Shiloh soils average more than 12.8 degrees C (55 degrees F) in the soil temperature control section and have less available phosphorous in the upper 91 cm (3 feet) (see remarks). Zoe soils contain more soluble salts and have a sodium absorption ratio of more than 10 in the series control section. Zook soils have mollic epipedons more than 91 cm (36 inches) thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slope gradients are less than 2 percent. These soils formed in colluvial sediments from adjacent or surrounding nearly level or gently undulating soils. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 12.5 degrees C (46.5 to 54.5 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 838 to 1092 mm (33 to 43 inches), frost-free period ranges from 140 to 195 days, and elevation ranges from 152 to 311 meters (500 to 1020 feet) above sea level."

Where drained, an apparent seasonal high water table is at a depth of 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1.0 foot) below the surface at some time between January and June in normal years. In undrained conditions, an apparent seasonal high water table is at a depth of 30 cm (1.0 foot) above the surface to15 cm (0.5 foot) below the surface at some time between October and September in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers/s). Permeability is moderately slow."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The differentiae needed to clearly separate the Peotone series from the Shiloh series is not well defined in terms of soil properties. Both Peotone and Shiloh soils are in depressional parts of broad interfluves. Peotone soils are on the Wisconsinan till plain and Shiloh soils are on the Illinoisan till plain. A marl substratum phase is currently recognized. These soils will be evaluated during MLRA updating to determine if new series are needed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nmollic epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 69 cm (0 to 27 inches) (Ap, A, and Bg1 horizons);\ncambic horizon - the zone from about 69 to 127 cm (27 to 50 inches) (Bg2 and Bg3 horizons);\naquic soil moisture regime - chroma of 1 in the matrix and redoximorphic features present in horizons below the mollic epipedon (Bg2, Bg3, and Cg horizons).\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nmollic epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 69 cm (0 to 27 inches) (Ap, A, and Bg1 horizons);\ncambic horizon - the zone from about 69 to 127 cm (27 to 50 inches) (Bg2 and Bg3 horizons);\naquic soil moisture regime - chroma of 1 in the matrix and redoximorphic features present in horizons below the mollic epipedon (Bg2, Bg3, and Cg horizons).\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
