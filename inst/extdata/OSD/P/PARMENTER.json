  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 41 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Rock fragments are of mixed mineralogy and include rounded and subrounded metamorphic, granitic, and volcanic rocks.  These soils have a volcanic ash mantle 14 to 30 inches thick. The upper part of the 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  The lower part of the particle-size control section is 50 to 80 percent rounded and subrounded metamorphic, granitic and volcanic rock fragments.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  It is ashy fine sandy loam or silt loam.  Some pedons have a bouldery surface.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent, of which there are 0 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones and boulders.\nThe Bw horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is ashy silt loam, ashy fine sandy loam, stony ashy loam or ashy loam and is gravelly in some pedons.  It is 5 to 25 percent rounded and subrounded rock fragments of which there are 0 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones and boulders.\nThe 2C horizon is coarsely stratified and has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  Sand and coarse sand are multicolored.  Texture of the fine earth fraction ranges from loamy fine sand to coarse sand.  It is extremely bouldery, very bouldery, extremely stony, very stony, extremely cobbly, very cobbly, very gravelly or extremely gravelly.  It is 50 to 80 percent rounded and subrounded rock fragments of which there are 25 to 60 percent gravel, 10 to 25 percent cobbles, and 0 to 25 percent stones."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Domkey, Limking, and Stepstone series.  Domkey soils are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days and are gravelly sandy loam or gravelly coarse sandy loam in the upper part of the particle-size control section.  Limking soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Stepstone soils are not stratified and have dominantly granitic rock fragments. Stepstone soils also have dense glacial till in the lower part of the control section."

These soils formed in glacial outwash with a mantle of volcanic ash.  They are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 15 to 24 inches.  The average January temperature is about 22 degrees F, average July temperature is about 65 degrees F, and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
