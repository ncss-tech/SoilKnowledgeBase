  "OVERVIEW": "The Perreau series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in lacustrine sediments and alluvium.  They are on dissected stream terraces and foothills.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 1 to 45 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
