Credo soils are 14 to 20 inches deep to the top of the argillic horizon and have silica cementation immediately below the argillic.  Favret soils are moderately deep to argillite bedrock.  Pedoli soils have concentrations of silica and lack concentrations of salt immediately below the argillic horizon."
