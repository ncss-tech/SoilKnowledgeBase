Clay content of the particle-size control section averages from 18 to 27 percent.  Free calcium carbonates are below a depth of 60 inches in some pedons.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 53 degrees F.  Rock fragments are absent throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam or loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is stratified.  Individual strata are mostly fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or silt loam with thin strata of coarser texture.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is stratified layers of sand to silty clay loam.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Plumcreek soils are on risers of stream terraces.  They formed in silty and loamy slope alluvium and in the underlying stratified mostly silty and loamy slackwater deposits which have strata of sandy alluvium.  Slope gradients range from 12 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from 135 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 600 to 900 feet."
