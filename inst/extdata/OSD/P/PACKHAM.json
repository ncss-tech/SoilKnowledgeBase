  "OVERVIEW": "The Packham series consists of very deep, well drained soils on stream and fan terraces.  They formed in mixed alluvium.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The soils formed in mixed alluvium, dominantly from quartzite and sedimentary rock sources but with some rhyolitic, basaltic, and granitic influence.  The climate is semiarid with dry summers.  Mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches including 1 to 3 feet of snowfall.  Average frost-free season is 80 to 125 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  In updating this series it was assumed that the 2Bk did not have more than 5 percent by weight more secondary carbonates than the underlying horizons and therefore did not qualify as a calcic horizon.  The AB horizon makes all the requirements of a mollic epipedon except for crushed dry color value.  It is likely that some areas mapped as Packham are actually Mollisols.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon\nCambic horizon - the zone from 6 to 24 inches (Bw horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
