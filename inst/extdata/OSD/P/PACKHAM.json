  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Packham soils are on stream and fan terraces at elevations of 4,200 to 5,400 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium, dominantly from quartzite and sedimentary rock sources but with some rhyolitic, basaltic, and granitic influence.  The climate is semiarid with dry summers.  Mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches including 1 to 3 feet of snowfall.  Average frost-free season is 80 to 125 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bannock and Hayeston soils.  Bannock soils have mollic epipedons and are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Hayeston soils are coarse-loamy and do not have a cambic horizon.  Both of these soils occur on similar landforms."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  In updating this series it was assumed that the 2Bk did not have more than 5 percent by weight more secondary carbonates than the underlying horizons and therefore did not qualify as a calcic horizon.  The AB horizon makes all the requirements of a mollic epipedon except for crushed dry color value.  It is likely that some areas mapped as Packham are actually Mollisols.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon\nCambic horizon - the zone from 6 to 24 inches (Bw horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
