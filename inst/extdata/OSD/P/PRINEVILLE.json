    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are dry for one-half to three-fourths of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  The soils are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 120 cumulative days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to secondary carbonates is 20 to 30 inches and depth to the hard firm brittle layer is 20 to 40 inches.  The sand-size (0.25 to 1.0mm) pumice content of the upper solum ranges from 5 to 30 percent.  It has a phosphate retention fo 15 to 25 percent and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.4 to 0.8 percent.  It has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and is neutral or slightly alkaline in the upper part and slightly to strongly alkaline in the lower part.  The particle-size control section averages 5 to 18 percent clay.\nThe A or Ap horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  The sand-size (0.25 to 1.0mm) pumice content ranges from 15 to 40 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  The sand-size (0.25 to 1.0mm) pumice content ranges from 5 to 15 percent.\nThe 2Bk and 2Bkq horizons have value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4, moist and dry.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand and contain 0 to 20 percent gravel.  It is slightly to violently effervescent.  Calcium carbonate is 2 to 5 percent.\nThe 3Crkq horizon is water laid sediments or paralithic tuffaceous sandstone of the Deschutes Formation and is strongly to violently effervescent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Prineville soils are on nearly level to gently sloping terraces at elevations of 2,900 to 3,100 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  They are underlain by water laid sediments or paralithic tuffaceous sandstone of the Deschutes Formation.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches, the mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
