  "OVERVIEW": "The Prineville series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  Prineville soils are on terraces and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The soils are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 120 cumulative days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to secondary carbonates is 20 to 30 inches and depth to the hard firm brittle layer is 20 to 40 inches.  The sand-size (0.25 to 1.0mm) pumice content of the upper solum ranges from 5 to 30 percent.  It has a phosphate retention fo 15 to 25 percent and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.4 to 0.8 percent.  It has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and is neutral or slightly alkaline in the upper part and slightly to strongly alkaline in the lower part.  The particle-size control section averages 5 to 18 percent clay.\nThe A or Ap horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  The sand-size (0.25 to 1.0mm) pumice content ranges from 15 to 40 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  The sand-size (0.25 to 1.0mm) pumice content ranges from 5 to 15 percent.\nThe 2Bk and 2Bkq horizons have value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4, moist and dry.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand and contain 0 to 20 percent gravel.  It is slightly to violently effervescent.  Calcium carbonate is 2 to 5 percent.\nThe 3Crkq horizon is water laid sediments or paralithic tuffaceous sandstone of the Deschutes Formation and is strongly to violently effervescent."
