  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon commonly is 10 to 20 inches thick, but ranges to 24 inches.  Commonly there is distinct stratification within 48 inches.  The particle size control section averages 50 to 60 percent clay and ranges to 65 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2 or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  The horizon commonly is mottled.  It commonly is clay, but includes silty clay and silty clay loam.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline in the Ap and mildly or moderately alkaline in the A horizon.\nThe Bg and Cg horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2 or are neutral with value of 4 or 5.  They are clay or silty clay.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dospalos, Gepford, Tinn, and Tulare soils in the same family and the Alligator, Iberia, and Sharkey soils. These soils have a different climate.  In addition, Dospalos and Tinn soils have mollic epipedons greater than 24 inches.  Gepford soils have higher conductivity.  Tulare soils have higher lime content.  Alligator and Sharkey soils lack mollic epipedons.  Iberia soils are not calcareous."

Caruthersville and Commerce soils have less clay and commonly are on higher flood plains or natural levees.  Cooter soils are sandy at depths of 12 to 24 inches and in similar positions.  Crevasse soils are sandy and are where there have been levee breaks and close to stream channels.  Hayti soils have less clay and are in similar positions.  Sharkey soils have more clay and are in similar positions."
