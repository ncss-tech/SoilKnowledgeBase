Dunbridge and Oneco soils have a lithic contact at depths of 51 to 152 cm (20 to 60 inches).  Fallleaf soils formed in loamy eolian and glacial fluvial material over till and have more than 40 percent sand in the surface layers.  Lauramie, Longlois and Mohawk soils have carbonates at depths of less than 178 cm (70 inches).  Lydick soils have rock fragments that dominantly consist of shale fragments.  Razort soils formed in silty alluvium over nonconforming residuum and typically have less than 40 percent sand and more than 30 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Pana soils formed in less than 38 cm (15 inches) of loess over loamy glacial drift from the Hagarstown member of the Pearl Formation.  These soils are dominantly on the ridged drift in the Kaskaskia basin.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic subgroup - the zone from the surface to a depth of 20 cm (8 inches) (Ap and A horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from a depth of 20 to 157 cm (8 to 62 inches) (Bt horizons).\nPana soils are considered eroded Mollisols but do not meet the previous classification of Typic Argiudolls and have been reclassified as part of the Montgomery Co. Soil Survey update, based on current criteria in the Key to Soil Taxonomy 10th edition.\nAdditional data: Data from the National Soil Survey Lab and the pedology laboratory at the University of Illinois, are on file for several pedons."
