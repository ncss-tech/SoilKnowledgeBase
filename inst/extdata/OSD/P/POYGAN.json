    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\n12/04  1650 acres of Poygan were correlated in Door County as a temperature taxadjunct because they are in the frigid temperature zone. A new series is needed.\n12/04 - This series previously included 2 different parent materials (clayey till and clayey lacustrine deposits). This revision redefines this series as being formed in clayey till only. A new series is needed for 1100 acres in Columbia County, 3850 acres in Green Lake County, 5240 acres in Juneau County, and 3480 acres in Marquette County which were correlated as being formed in clayey lacustrine deposits. In addition, a portion of the acreage correlated in surveys in Adams, Brown, Calumet-Manitowoc, Fond du Lac, Kewaunee, Outagamie, Ozaukee, Sheboygan, and Waushara Counties may be formed in clayey lacustrine deposits. A new series will be needed for these acres when these surveys are updated.\nDiagnostic horizons and feature recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - 0 to 33 cm (0 to 13 inches) (A, AB); cambic horizon - 33 to 69 cm (13 to 27 inches) (Bg, BC);  aquic suborder  saturation between 41 to 51 cm (16 and 20 inches) with chroma of 1 in the lower part of the mollic epipedon and chroma of 1 in the matrix immediately below the mollic epipedon with hue yellower than 2.5Y.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
