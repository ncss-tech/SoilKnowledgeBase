It is medium acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry. It commonly is clay loam and less commonly silty clay loam. Rock fragment content is 5 to 35 percent.\nThe B horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry. The fine earth fraction commonly is sandy loam or sandy clay loam, but the range includes silty clay loam, clay loam, and very fine sandy loam. Rock fragments range from 40 to 60 percent."

These soils formed in volcanic ash and are underlain with dense lava at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Elevation is near sea level to 900 feet. The mean annual rainfall is 150 to 200 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F."

Oloava soils have soft weathered cinders in the control section. Puapua soils are underlain with hard volcanic tuff within depths of 20 inches. Sogi soils are ashy in the lower part of the control section."
