  "OVERVIEW": "The Pavaiai series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on uplands. These soils formed in volcanic ash and are underlain with lava. Slope is 6 to 40 percent. Elevation is near sea level to 900 feet. The mean annual rainfall is about 175 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F.",

It is medium acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry. It commonly is clay loam and less commonly silty clay loam. Rock fragment content is 5 to 35 percent.\nThe B horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry. The fine earth fraction commonly is sandy loam or sandy clay loam, but the range includes silty clay loam, clay loam, and very fine sandy loam. Rock fragments range from 40 to 60 percent."
