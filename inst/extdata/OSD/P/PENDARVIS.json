  "REVDATE": "08/2004",
  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pendarvis series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly or moderately slowly permeable soils on low ridges and knolls in the flatwoods.  They formed in thick deposits of sandy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slope is dominantly less than 2 percent but ranges to 5 percent along drainage ways and depressions.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Total thickness of the A and E horizons range from 30 to 50 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A and E horizons and from extremely acid to moderately acid in the Bh and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1; or it neutral with value of 2 to 4.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Streaks and masses of organic matter accumulations range from none to common.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nA Bw horizon is between the E and Bh horizon in some pedons.  Where present, it has hue of 10YR, value 3 or 4, and chroma 1 or 2.  Streaks and splotches of organic matter depletions range from few to many.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value 2 or 3, and chroma of 4 or less; or it is neutral with value of 2.  It is weakly or moderately cemented in 60 to  90 percent of the horizon.  Some pedons have a lower Bh horizon that is noncemented and has the same range of colors and textures.  Thickness of the Bh horizon is highly variable within short distances.  Texture is fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nAn and E&Bh or E'&Bh horizon is in some pedons.  Where present, the E or E part of the horizon has the same range of color and textures as the E horizon, and the Bh part has the same range as the Bh horizon.  Fragments of Bh material range from few to common.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, chroma of 5 to 7, and value of 3 or less.  Texture is fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand."

All of these soils are very poorly or poorly drained, are on lower positions and, except for Ankona soils, lack ortstein.  In addition, Ankona, EauGallie, Oldsmar, Wabasso, and Wauchula soils have argillic horizons beneath the spodic horizon.  Basinger soils have weakly expressed spodic horizons."

The water is perched above the spodic horizon early in the summer rainy season and after heavy rainfall in other seasons.\nPendarvis soils were formerly included in the Pomello series.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity of the spodic horizon from nine pedons ranges from 0.68 to 0.00 in. /hr.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
