  "OVERVIEW": "The Polonio series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous sedimentary alluvium. Polonio soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

The soils are moist from about December 15 until about May 15; but in 6 out of 10 years, they are never moist in some parts between depths of 6 and 18 inches for 90 consecutive days. The soils have less than 30 percent coarse sand. The sands are rounded rather than angular.  Gravel content is 0 to 35 percent throughout\nThe A horizon has a dry color of 10YR 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 6/1, 6/2 or 6/3. Moist color is 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 5/1, 5/2 or 5/3. It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silt loam or loam. This horizon is slightly hard or hard.\nThe Bk horizon has a dry color of 7.5YR 5/4; 10YR 5/4, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3, 7/4, 8/3, 8/4.
