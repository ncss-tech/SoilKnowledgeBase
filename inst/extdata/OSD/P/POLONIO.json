The soils are moist from about December 15 until about May 15; but in 6 out of 10 years, they are never moist in some parts between depths of 6 and 18 inches for 90 consecutive days. The soils have less than 30 percent coarse sand. The sands are rounded rather than angular.  Gravel content is 0 to 35 percent throughout\nThe A horizon has a dry color of 10YR 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 6/1, 6/2 or 6/3. Moist color is 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 5/1, 5/2 or 5/3. It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silt loam or loam. This horizon is slightly hard or hard.\nThe Bk horizon has a dry color of 7.5YR 5/4; 10YR 5/4, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3, 7/4, 8/3, 8/4.
