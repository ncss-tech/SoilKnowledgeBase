  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinal series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources but mainly tuffs, rhyolite and volcanic ash.  Pinal soils are on alluvial fans and terraces and have slopes of 0 to 9 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 71 degrees F.",

Slope gradients range from 0 to 9 percent. The soils developed in medium-textured nongravelly or gravelly alluvium derived from mixed rock sources but mainly tuffs, rhyolite and volcanic ash. The climate is warm, arid, and continental. Mean annual temperature ranges from 67 degrees to 76 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 3 to 10 inches. The frost-free season ranges from 250 to 350 days."
