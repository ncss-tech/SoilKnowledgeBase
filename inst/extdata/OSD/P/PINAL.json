    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pinal soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping old alluvial fans and terraces at elevations of 400 to 2,500 feet. Slope gradients range from 0 to 9 percent. The soils developed in medium-textured nongravelly or gravelly alluvium derived from mixed rock sources but mainly tuffs, rhyolite and volcanic ash. The climate is warm, arid, and continental. Mean annual temperature ranges from 67 degrees to 76 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 3 to 10 inches. The frost-free season ranges from 250 to 350 days."
