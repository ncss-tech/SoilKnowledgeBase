  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinitos series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that developed in eolian and alluvial material derived from sandstone and shale on hills, fan terraces, cuestas and mesas.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
