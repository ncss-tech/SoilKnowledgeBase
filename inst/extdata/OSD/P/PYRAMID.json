    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Pyramid soils are on steep ridges and mountainslopes.  The soils are formed in a mixture of volcanic ash and residuum/colluvium from metamorphic and igneous rocks.  The climate is cool maritime.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 70 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.  Temperatures below freezing are recorded on fewer than 40 days annually, and temperatures above 70 degrees F. are rare."

The native vegetation is tall grass, dominantly bluejoint reedgrass, and associated plants including fireweed, salmonberry, and alder.  A few patches of white spruce, Sitka spruce, and paper birch occur in places."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The concept of the Pyramid series is poorly defined, especially in regards to the properties of the underlying material.  The typical profile should classify as thixotropic-skeletal.  More data is needed to define the central concept or the series should be inactivated (jpm, 4/87). More data on this soil will be collected when the survey is updated.\nSource of the volcanic ash is the 1912 eruption of Mt. Novarupta and Mt.  Katmai on the Alaska Peninsula.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
