  "OVERVIEW": "The Poorcal series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived primarily from sedimentary rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Poorcal soils are on alluvial fans, fan skirts, inset fans and inset fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
