    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Petspring soils are on mountain backslopes, hills and rock pediment remnants.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from granodiorite.  Elevations are 1,320 to 2,130 meters.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The climate is cool semiarid, with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperatures range from 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."
