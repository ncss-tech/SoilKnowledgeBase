  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Petspring series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from highly weathered granitic rocks on mountains, hills and pediments.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 225 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",

Elevations are 1,320 to 2,130 meters.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The climate is cool semiarid, with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperatures range from 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."
