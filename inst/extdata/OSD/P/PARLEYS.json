  "OVERVIEW": "The Parleys series consists of very deep, well and moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments.  The Parleys soils are on lake terraces, stream terraces, and foothills.  Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The combined thickness of the A and Bt horizons ranges from 18 to 40 inches.  Depth to the horizon of carbonate accumulation is 18 to 40 inches; Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 40 percent.  Most commonly the depth to water table is more than 72 inches, but some soils with water table at depths of 40 to 72 inches are within the range of the series (see remarks).\nThe moisture regime is xeric bordering on aridic.  These soils are are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for over 60 consecutive days in the 4 months following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches is 47 to 58 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is 60 to 70 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the surface horizons is loam, silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is most commonly clay loam with less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand, but ranges to silty clay loam or to very fine sandy clay loam. Structure ranges from weak to strong, prismatic or blocky. Clay films range from thin to moderately thick, few to continuous. This horizon is slightly acid to slightly alkaline. Some pedons have Btk horizons.\nThe Bk and Ck horizons range from 20 to 45 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. Hue is 10YR or 2.5Y, value 6 or 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist, chroma 2 to 4. It is moderately to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon is stratified and ranges from loam, silt loam or fine sandy loam, to clay loam or silty clay loam. In places mottles occur in the lower C horizons at depth below 40 inches."

Kidman soils lack argillic horizons and have fine sandy loam textures in the 10- to 40-inch control section. Stoda soils lack argillic horizons."

The native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, junegrass, western wheatgrass, gumweed, balsamroot, big sagebrush, and oakbrush.  In Utah this series is correlated with Upland loam (Basin Big Sagebrush) and Upland Stony Loam (Wyoming Big Sagebrush) ecological sites.  In Idaho this series is correlated with Loamy 12-16 ARTRT/PSSP6 ecological site."

There is a need for additional field work to refine the drainage class."
