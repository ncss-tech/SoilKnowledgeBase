    "content": "REMARKS: Pluck soils were formerly included in the Nahatche or Mantachie series. The series was reclassified in 2013 as part of the update of MLRA 152B. The series type location was moved to Tyler County to a pedon that better represented the total series province.\nDiagnostic horizons and features of this soil are:\nOchric epipedon -0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in) (A horizons)\nCambic horizon- 15 to 203 cm (6 to 80 in) (Bg1, Bg2, Bg3, Bg4, Bg5 horizons)\nThere is an irregular distribution of organic carbon and the organic carbon is more than 0.2 percent.\nThe soil is saturated during the winter and spring seasons and has an aquic mosture regime.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Particle-size analysis and pH tests were performed at the project office on the series type location. Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory data available on pedon S12TX373023 from a representative area in Polk County, Texas near the type location.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
