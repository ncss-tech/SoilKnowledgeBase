  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinepoint series consists of moderately deep to very deep, somewhat excessively drained, very rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian sand.  Pinepoint soils are on sand sheets on structural benches, alluvial flats, drainageways, and climbing dunes. Slope ranges 2 to 50 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
