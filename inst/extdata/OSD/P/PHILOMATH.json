    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 80 consecutive following the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F. The depth to a paralithic contact of weakly to moderately cemented igneous rock is 12 to 20 inches. The mollic epipedon is 12 to 20 inches thick. The pscs averages 40 to 60 percent clay, 0 to 35 percent rock fragments and 0 to 5 percent pararock fragments.  The profile cracks throughout its depth during the summer.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or cobbly silty clay with 30 to 55 percent clay. It has 0 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobbles. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry. Texture is silty clay loam, clay, silty clay, cobbly silty clay or cobbly clay with 35 to 55 percent clay. It has 0 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent paragravel. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe A3 horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry. Texture is silty clay, clay, cobbly silty clay or cobbly clay with 40 to 60 percent clay. It has 0 to 20 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent paragravel. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Philomath soils are on convex hills at elevations of 300 to 2,000 feet. These soils formed in fine textured residuum or colluvium weathered from basic igneous rock. Slopes are 3 to 70 percent. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches. The mean annual temperature is 49 to 55 degrees F. The mean January temperature is 38 to 40 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 64 to 68 degrees F. The frost-free season is 160 to 235 days."

Dixonville, Gellatly, Hazelair, Ritner and Witham soils are greater than 20 inches to bedrock. Dixonville soils occur on linear or convex parts of the hillslope. Gellatly soils occur on linear or concave parts of the hillslope. Hazelair soils occur on the concave parts of the hillslope. Ritner soils occur on convex parts of the hillslope at higher elevations. Witham soils occur on fans, footslopes, or toeslopes. Withzel soils are skeletal and occur on convex parts of the hillslope."
