The Blackleed soils are slightly to strongly acid, are noncalcareous throughout, and receive 35 to 50 inches precipitation.  Devore soils have granitic bedrock at less than 40 inches, are noncalcareous throughout, and receive 60 to 70 inches of precipitation.  Elve soils are noncalcareous, range from slightly to strongly acid, and have E horizons.  Firada soils have limestone bedrock at less than 40 inches and an E at the surface.  Garlet soils have O&E and B&A horizons and depth to carbonates is greater than 40 inches.  Ketchum soils have base saturation of 60 to 75 in some subhorizons above 75 cm, an A, E, A&B, B&A, C horizon sequence and are noncalcareous throughout.  Losee soils have 7.5YR or redder hues in the control section.  Nambe soils are extremely to strongly acid, have an A, E, Bir, C horizon sequence, have 38 to 50 inches of precipitation, and have an average annual soil of temperature of about 33 degrees F.  Scout soils receive 25 to 40 inches precipitation and have an A1, E, B horizon sequence.  Taglake soils have control section textures of cobbly sandy loam only and have an E horizon and lack Ck horizons.  Targhee soils receive 30 to 35 inches of precipitation, are less than 40 inches deep to rhyolite tuff bedrock and lack carbonates."

Poso soils formed in residuum and slope alluvium derived dominantly from calcareous sandstone conglomerate.  The average annual precipitation is 15 to 20 inches, the average annual air temperature is 33 to 39 degrees F., the average summer temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F., and the frost-free season is from 45 to 65 days."

The Swampydraw sols have a mollic epipedon that is 9 to 16 inches thick, and an argillic horizon with 21 to 34 percent clay, and are found on alluvial fan terrace sideslopes.  Windicreek soils have a mollic epipedon that is 9 to 13 inches thick and contains less than 18 percent clay in the control section, and are dominantly on concave ridge slopes.  Zeebar soils are neutral throughout the profile and contains greater than 18 percent clay in the control section."
