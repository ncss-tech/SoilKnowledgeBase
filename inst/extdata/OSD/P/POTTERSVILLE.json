  "OVERVIEW": "The Pottersville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and in the underlying calcareous, clayey and silty lacustrine deposits. The Pottersville soils are on dissected lake plains. Slope ranges from 12 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
