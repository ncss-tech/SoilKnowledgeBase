    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Piojillo soils are on south-facing footslopes and toeslopes of valley sides. They formed in slope alluvium derived from pumice and volcanic ash of the Quaternary age Bandelier Tuff formation. Slopes are 3 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,700 to 7,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."
