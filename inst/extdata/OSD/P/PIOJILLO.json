  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Piojillo series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from pumice and volcanic ash.  Piojillo soils are on south-facing footslopes and toeslopes of valley sides.  Slopes are 3 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
