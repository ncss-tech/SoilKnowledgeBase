  "OVERVIEW": "The Paulville series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in mixed alluvium and lacustrine sediments.  They are on terraces, basalt plains and buttes, with slopes of 0 to 6 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
