Banbury and Trevino soils are shallow to basalt.  Portneuf soils lack an argillic horizon, and have less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Emberton soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Escalante soils have sandy textures throughout.  Owinza soils have greater than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Suepert soils are moderately deep to a hardpan and have a loamy-skeletal control section.  Banbury, Emberton, and Suepert soils are on higher terraces than Paulville.  Owinza soils are in depressions.  Portneuf soils are on basalt plains and higher terraces.  Trevino soils are on basalt ridges."
