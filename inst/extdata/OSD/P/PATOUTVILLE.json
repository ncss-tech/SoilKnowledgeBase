Acy and Essen soils do not have red iron accumulations and contain calcium carbonate concretions.  Frozard, and Galvez soils do not have red iron accumulations in the subsoil. Solier soils have a discontinuity to a buried albic horizon and an argillic horizon with albic intrusions at 12 to 24 inches deep. Kurk and McGehee soils have an active activity class, formed in alluvium or alluvium over loess, and have a lithologic discontinuity."
