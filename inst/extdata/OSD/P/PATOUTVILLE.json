Typically, these soils have less than 10 percent sand throughout the solum. The calcium-magnesium ratio is 1 or more. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the A and E horizons. In nonirrigated areas, the A and E horizons are typically very strongly acid to slightly acid. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the Btg and Bt horizons; and from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the underlying horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 to 3, or value of 5 and chroma of 2 or 3. Where value is 3, the A or Ap horizon is less than 6 inches thick. Texture is silt or silt loam.\nThe Eg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2; or hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2.

Red masses of iron accumulation are diagnostic for the series and are present in some part of the Btg or B'tg horizon. Iron accumulations in shades of brown, and iron depletions in shades of gray are present in most pedons. Peds are coated with clay films in shades of brown or gray. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt and B't horizons have ped interiors that have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Red masses of iron accumulation are diagnostic for the series and are present in some part of the Bt or B't horizon.

Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 6; or it is variegated with these colors. Iron accumulations in shades of brown, and iron depletions in shades of gray are present in most pedons. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.\nThe BC and C horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 6; or they are variegated with these colors.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Acy, Essen, Frozard, and Solier series in the same family. The Galvez, Kurk, and McGehee series are in a closely related families. Acy and Essen soils do not have red iron accumulations and contain calcium carbonate concretions.  Frozard, and Galvez soils do not have red iron accumulations in the subsoil. Solier soils have a discontinuity to a buried albic horizon and an argillic horizon with albic intrusions at 12 to 24 inches deep. Kurk and McGehee soils have an active activity class, formed in alluvium or alluvium over loess, and have a lithologic discontinuity."

Average annual precipitation ranges from 55 to 65 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 70 degrees F.. Frost free days range from 235 to 350. Elevation ranges from 5 to 80 feet."

Crowley soils have more than 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon, and have an abrupt textural change. In addition, Crowley soils are on slightly lower landscape positions. Frost and Jeanerette soils are in depressions and along drainageways. In addition, Frost soils are poorly drained, and Jeanerette soils have a mollic epipedon. Duson soils are on side slopes and convex ridges, and do not have aquic conditions in the upper 5 inches of the argillic horizon."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The CEC:Clay ratio for this pedon is 0.58, which is slightly below the range for the superactive activity class. It was felt that this is within the range of lab error, however, and data from similar soils indicate that soils on these landscapes and parent materials are tending more towards the superactive class.\nDiagnostic horizons and properties in this soil include:\nOchric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 11 inches (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - from a depth of 11 to 83 inches (Btg, Bt, B'tg, B't, and 2Bt horizons).\nRed masses of iron accumulation - from a depth of 15 to 28 inches (Btg2, Bt, and B'tg1 horizons).\nLithologic Discontinuity - at 68 inches (top of 2Bt horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data on the typifying pedon were obtained from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, sample number S93LA001-16.\nMLRA=134\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
