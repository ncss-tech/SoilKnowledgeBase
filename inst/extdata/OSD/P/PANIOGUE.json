Elevations are mostly between 2,100 to 5,000 feet.  The soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources but mostly from sedimentary rock, but the upper part probably contains much loessal material.  The climate is semiarid.  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, including 1.5 to 3 feet of snow.  The average annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free season is 100 to 155 days."

Chedehap, Clems, and Escalante soils are moderately coarse textured and lack contrasting textures above a depth at 40 inches.  Greenleaf soils have a moderately fine textured subsoil over laminated silts.  Power and Purdam soils have argillic horizons over duripans that are deep, very deep, or moderately deep."
