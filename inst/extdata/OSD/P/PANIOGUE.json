  "OVERVIEW": "The Paniogue series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources. Permeability is moderate.  Paniogue soils are on terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Elevations are mostly between 2,100 to 5,000 feet.  The soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources but mostly from sedimentary rock, but the upper part probably contains much loessal material.  The climate is semiarid.  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, including 1.5 to 3 feet of snow.  The average annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free season is 100 to 155 days."

Greenleaf soils have a moderately fine textured subsoil over laminated silts.  Power and Purdam soils have argillic horizons over duripans that are deep, very deep, or moderately deep."
