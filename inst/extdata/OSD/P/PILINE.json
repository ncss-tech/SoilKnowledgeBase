  "OVERVIEW": "The Piline series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Piline soils are on internally drained areas of small relict lake plains, alluvial flats and playas.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
