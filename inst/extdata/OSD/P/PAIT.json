These soils formed in alluvium, colluvium, and lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks such as basalt and tuff.  Slopes are 1 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,525 meters.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
