  "OVERVIEW": "The Pait series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, and lacustrine deposits derived from basalt and tuff.  Pait soils are on fan remnants, lake terraces, and strath terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about  230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
