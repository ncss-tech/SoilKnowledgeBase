    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 59 to 62 degrees.  The soil between the depths of 6 and 18 inches is dry in all parts from August 1 to October 1 and is moist in all parts from November 1 to June 15 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay.\nThe A horizon is 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2; 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2 or 6/3.  Moist color is 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2; 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2 or 4/3.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 27 percent.  Organic carbon content ranges from 0.6 to 3.0 percent.  Gravel content ranges from 2 to 10 percent.  Soil reaction is very strongly to medium acid.\nThe Bt horizon is 2.5Y 5/4, 6/4, 7/2, 7/4; 10YR 5/2, 6/2, 6/3 or 7/3.  Moist colors are 2.5Y 5/4, 6/2, 6/4; 10YR 4/2, 5/3, 5/4 or 6/3.  Mottle colors are 10YR 5/8, 6/1, 7/1, 7/4; 7.5YR 5/6, 5/8 or 6/6. Moist mottle colors are 10YR 5/1, 5/6, 5/8, 6/1, 6/8; 7.5YR 4/6, 5/6 or 5/8.  Matrix or mottle colors with moist chromas of 1 or 2 are redox depletions and occur between the surface and a depth of 10 inches and may continue to greater than 60 inches.  Mottle colors with chroma of 6 and 8 are redox concentrations.  The Bt horizon is sandy clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.  Gravelly or very gravelly sandy clay loams occur below 50 inches in most, but not all, pedons.  Clay content ranges from 25 to 50 percent.  Hard gravel content is typically 2 to 10 percent but ranges from 25 to 50 percent in the gravelly or very gravelly subhorizon.  Base saturation (sum) ranges from 40 to 75 percent in the upper part and 50 to 90 percent in the lower part. Reaction is very strongly through slightly acid"
