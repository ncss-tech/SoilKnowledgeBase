The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout, except for the surface layer in areas that have been limed.  The particle-size control section, upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon, has 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 20 percent silt.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe E horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Btl horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 to 8, or it has hue of 7.5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 6 to 8.  If mottles are present, they are few or common in shades of brown or red.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bt2 horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 to 8, and it commonly has mottles in shades of gray, brown, or red; in some pedons it is mottled in shades of red, gray, brown, or yellow.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bt3 horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6, with few to many medium or coarse mottles in shades of red, gray, yellow, or brown; or it is mottled in these colors.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon either is mottled in shades of red, brown, and gray, or it has a matrix in hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, chroma of 1 to 3, with few to many mottles in shades of red, gray, or brown.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Attoyac, Caledonia, Elrose, and Sallisaw series in the same family and the closely related Braxton, Freest, Kamie, Macon, and Woden series.  Attoyac soils are less clayey in the lower part of the Bt horizon and do not have slickensides or pressure faces in the lower part of the Bt horizon.  Caledonia soils, which are less clayey in the lower part of the Bt horizon and do not have slickensides, are well drained with the water table at a depth greater than 6 feet.  Elrose soils have glauconite fragments in the Bt horizon.  Sallisaw soils have 35 to 90 percent coarse fragments by volume in the lower part of the Bt horizon.  Braxton soils are fine in the particle-size control section.  Freest soils have hue yellower than 10YR in the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Kamie and Macon soils have mixed mineralogy.  Woden soils are coarse-loamy in the particle-size control section."

In addition, Benndale soils are well drained and are coarse-loamy in the particle-size control section; Cadeville soils are fine in the particle-size control section and have a solum less than 60 inches thick; Susquehanna soils are fine in the particle-size control section and are somewhat poorly drained. Falkner soils, which are fine-silty in the particle-size control section, are somewhat poorly drained in nearly level to sloping areas with low relief.  Prentiss and Savannah soils, which mainly are on ridgetops, have a fragipan."
