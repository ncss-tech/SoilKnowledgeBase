  "OVERVIEW": "The Pober series consists of moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from sedimentary rocks.  Pober soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
