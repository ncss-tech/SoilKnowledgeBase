  "STATES": "NM,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinon series consists of soils that are shallow to hard limestone bedrock.  They are well drained, moderately slowly permeable that formed in alluvium and residuum. These soils are on knolls, ridges, mesas and hillslopes. Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches; mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

These soils formed in alluvium and residuum derived from limestone. Mean annual temperature ranges from 49 to 56 degrees F., and a mean summer temperature of 64 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 15 inches. The frost-free period ranges from 130 to 170 days. In Colorado these soils have air temperatures ranging from 45 to 48 degrees F. and have a frost-free period of 90 to 130 days with elevations up to 7,400 feet. Elevation ranges from 5,500 to 6,700 feet."
