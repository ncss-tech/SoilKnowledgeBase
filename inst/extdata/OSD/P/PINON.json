  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pinon soils are on knolls, ridges, mesas and hillslopes. Slope gradients range from 1 to 30 percent. These soils formed in alluvium and residuum derived from limestone. Mean annual temperature ranges from 49 to 56 degrees F., and a mean summer temperature of 64 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 15 inches. The frost-free period ranges from 130 to 170 days. In Colorado these soils have air temperatures ranging from 45 to 48 degrees F. and have a frost-free period of 90 to 130 days with elevations up to 7,400 feet. Elevation ranges from 5,500 to 6,700 feet."
