Chillon soils are on nonflooded low terraces, and have cambic horizons. Corazones soils are on higher pediment remnants and have calcic horizons. Ojinaga soils are on higher pediment remnants and have petrocalcic horizons. Tornillo soils are on adjacent alluvial flats, contain less than 5 percent rock fragments in the control section, and have cambic horizons."
