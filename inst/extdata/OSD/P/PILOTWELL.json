Slopes are 5 to 60 percent.  The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and cool somewhat moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches, some as winter snow at the higher elevations.  The mean January temperature is about 41 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 77 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 56 to 61 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 175 to 225 days."
