  "OVERVIEW": "The Pilotwell series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in material weathered from  granitic rock.  Pilotwell soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 5 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
