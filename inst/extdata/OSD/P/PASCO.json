    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 47 to 55 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 24 to more than 40 inches thick.  These soils are typically calcareous throughout but may be noncalcareous in the upper 10 inches.  They are mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline, becoming less alkaline with depth.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry.  It has weak fine granular to weak thin platy structure.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.  It is weak medium prismatic or weak medium subangular blocky structure.  Some pedons are massive.  In some pedons the C horizon is stratified with lenses of fine sandy loam about 1 to 3 inches thick.  Mottles occur in some pedons below 20 inches."

Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent.  Pasco soils formed in recent alluvium accumulating under ponded drainage conditions.  The climate is arid to semiarid; the mean annual temperature is 54 degrees F.; and the average annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches.  The frost free season is 136 to 190 days."
