These soils are typically calcareous throughout but may be noncalcareous in the upper 10 inches.  They are mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline, becoming less alkaline with depth.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry.  It has weak fine granular to weak thin platy structure.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.  It is weak medium prismatic or weak medium subangular blocky structure.  Some pedons are massive.  In some pedons the C horizon is stratified with lenses of fine sandy loam about 1 to 3 inches thick.  Mottles occur in some pedons below 20 inches."

Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent.  Pasco soils formed in recent alluvium accumulating under ponded drainage conditions.  The climate is arid to semiarid; the mean annual temperature is 54 degrees F.; and the average annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches.  The frost free season is 136 to 190 days."
