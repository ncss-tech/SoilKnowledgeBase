  "OVERVIEW": "The Prather series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in weathered glacial drift derived from basic igneous rocks.  Prather soils are on terraces and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 55 inches and average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches and the soil thickness overlying slow or very slowly permeable horizons ranges from 20 to 30 inches.  Depth to mottles with chroma of 2 or less ranges from 20 to 30 inches.  The average annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 to 55 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but they are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and l2 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days within the 3 months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section contains 35 to 60 percent clay and is typically silty clay but is silty clay loam or clay in some pedons.  Base saturation, by sum of cations, is 35 to 55 percent at depth of 1.25 meters below the upper boundary of the argillic horizon.  These soils have 10YR or 7.5YR hue throughout the A, AB, and upper Bt horizons.\nThe A and AB horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry.  It has moderate or strong structure.  This horizon is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist, 6 through 8 dry.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  This horizon is moderately acid or strongly acid.  The BC horizon is mottled silty clay, or clay.  This B3 horizon contains widely varying amounts of very strongly weathered gravel and cobble size fragments that are rounded and soft.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.  The BCt, where present, ranges in hue from 2.5YR to 2.5Y."

Bow and Coveland soils have an albic horizon and are slightly acid or neutral throughout.  Coweeman soils have an ochric epipedon and have a chroma of 1 or 2 throughout the argillic horizon. Hardscrabble soils have an ochric epipedon and an abrupt increase in clay of 20 to 30 percent at the AB - Bt contact.  Sara soils have a perched water table during the winter and early spring and lack mottles in the lower Bt horizon. Scamman soils have an ochric epipedon, an albic horizon, and tonguing of albic material into the argillic horizon."

The soils formed in very strongly weathered ancient glacial drift deposits derived from basic and acid igneous rocks.  The climate is a marine-type having cool dry summers and mild wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches.  Average annual temperature is 50 degrees  F.  The average January temperature is 39 degrees F; average July temperature is 65 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges between l50 and 200 days."

Small grain, pasture, hay, and corn for silage  are common crops.  Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, western hemlock, red alder, western redcedar, and bigleaf maple, with an understory of salal, Oregon-grape, western brackenfern, western swordfern, vine maple, red huckleberry, trailing blackberry, trillium, Oregon oxalis, Pacific dogwood, bedstraw, longtube twinflower, creambush oceanspray and deer fern."
