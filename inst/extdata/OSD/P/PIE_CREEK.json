  "OVERVIEW": "The Pie Creek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from tuff.  Pie Creek soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
