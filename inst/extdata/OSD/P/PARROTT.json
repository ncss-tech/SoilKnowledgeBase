The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay.  Mineralogy is mixed.  Organic matter decreases regularly with depth and ranges from 1 to 5 percent to a depth of 49 inches, (124 cm) and is less than 1.0 percent to a depth of 89 inches, (226 cm).  Base saturation by ammonium acetate is 100 percent throughout.  A fluctuating water table can occur at depths of 60 inches, (152 cm) or more below the surface of the soil from December through March.  Redoximorphic features such as iron masses and manganese masses occur in both the Ap and A horizons.  Some pedons have gravelly substratum below 40 inches, (102 cm) and or have disseminated lime between 45 to 72 inches (114 o 183cm).\nThe A horizon dry color is 2.5Y 6/2, 10YR 5/2, 5/3 or 6/3.  Moist color is 2.5Y 3/2, 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2 or 4/3.  Texture is silt loam.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 27 percent.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon dry color is 10YR 5/3, 5/4 or 6/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 3/4 or 4/3.  Texture is silt loam.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 27 percent.  Reaction ranges from neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon dry color is 10YR 5/3, 5/4 or 6/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 3/4 or 4/3.

These soils formed in alluvium weathered from mixed rocks.  Elevation is 85 to 170 feet, (26 to 52 m).  Mean annual precipitation is 18 to 23 inches, (457 to 584 mm).  The mean annual temperature is 60 to 62 degrees F, (16 to 17 degrees C).  Frost free season is 240 to 245 days."

Columbia soils are coarse-loamy, have water tables within 20 inches, (51 cm) of the surface and are stratified.  Farwell soils are fine-loamy and are in margins between floodplains and alluvial fans.  Gianella soils are coarse-loamy and are on floodplains within the meander belt."

The soils are occasionally to frequently flooded for very brief to brief periods in December through March.  Water occasionally ponds up to 0.5 inches, (1.3 cm) above the surface for a very brief duration from December through March following intense precipitation events.  A fluctuating  water table can occur at depths of 60 inches, (152 cm) or more below the surface of the soil from December through March.  During exceptionally wet winters the water table may be as high as 8 to 30 inches, (20 to 76 cm) below the surface of the soil from December through March."
