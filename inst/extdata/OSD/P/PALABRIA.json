  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Palabria series consists of well drained soils that are deep to sandstone bedrock.  They formed in eolian material derived from sandstone and shale over residuum weathered from sandstone of the Chinle formation.  Palabria soils are on structural benches.  Slopes are 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
