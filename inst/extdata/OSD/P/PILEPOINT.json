  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pilepoint soils are on hills of drift plains.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent. These soils formed in eolian sand over glacial outwash and dense glaciomarine deposits. Elevations range from 0 to 300 feet. The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and mild moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 18 to 30 inches. The average annual air temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is about 200 to 240 days."

Haro soils are on adjacent hillsides and have a lithic contact within 20 inches. Mitchellbay soils are also on glacial drift plains but lack a mollic epipedon. San Juan soils are on hill slopes and glacial outwash plains and lack an albic horizon, an argillic horizon, and a densic contact."
