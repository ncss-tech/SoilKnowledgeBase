  "OVERVIEW": "The Parlo series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed lake sediments and alluvium.  The Parlo soils are on high lake terraces or stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 63 to 68 degrees F. The soils are moist for 55 to 65 percent of the time and are dry in all parts of the 4 to 12 inch section for 60 to 75 consecutive days in the summer and autumn.\nThe mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 19 inches thick. The depth to the horizon of carbonate accumulation ranges from 18 to 36 inches. The depth to the very gravelly sand or loamy sand ranges from 24 to 40 inches. Small amounts of gravel are scattered on the surface and in the subsoils of some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It has weak to moderate, fine or medium granuler or subangular blocky structure. This horizon is slightly alkaline or neutral. It is 8 to 19 inches thick.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or silt loam with less than 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. This horizon has weak to moderate, fine and medium prismatic and subangular blocky structure. It has many to continuous thin to moderately thick clay films. The Bt horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline. It is 8 to 24 inches thick.\nThe Ck horizon has hue of 10YR 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is loam or gravelly sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon is very gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly sand. The gravel content in the IIC horizon ranges from 35 to 80 percent."

They formed in mixed lake sediments and alluvium mainly from limestone, sandstone, and quartzite rocks.  The climate is dry or moist subhumid. The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F. The mean summer temperature ranges from 65 to 73 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 100 to 150 days.

All of these soils lack the abrupt texture change to sand or loamy sand at depths less than 40 inches. Eastcan soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick lack argillic horizons and calcic horizons.  Hillfield soils lack mollic epipedons and are silt loam or sandy loam throughout the control section. Nibley soils have argillic horizons with more than 35 percent clay. Redola and Steed soils both lack argillic horizons. Redola soils are coarse-loamy. Steed soils are fragmental in the control section."
