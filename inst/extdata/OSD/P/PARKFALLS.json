    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the densic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Content of clay averages from 7 to 17 percent in the particle-size control section and in the argillic horizon. The content of sand coarser than very fine averages 35 to 70 percent. Coarse fragments are dominantly of igneous origin and are of mixed lithology. Total volume of rock fragment ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the upper part of the loamy alluvium, 0 to 25 percent in the lower part, and 5 to 35 percent in the dense till. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 20 percent in the loamy alluvium and from 5 to 35 percent in the dense till. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent and volume of stones ranges from 0 to 3 percent throughout. Surface stones have coverage ranging from 0 to 3 percent. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the loamy alluvium, but ranges to neutral where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part of the loamy alluvium and from strongly acid to neutral in the dense till. Masses of iron accumulations are in the spodic horizon within 20 inches of the mineral soil surface. Aquic conditions occur within 20 inches at some time in normal years.\nO horizon\nHue: 7.5YR, 10YR, or neutral\nValue: 2 to 3\nChroma: 0 to 2\nTexture: a mat of partially to highly decomposed forest litter.\nSome pedons have an A or Ap horizon\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 2 or 3\nChroma: 1 or 2\nTexture: sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nE horizon\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 4 or 5\nChroma: 2 or 3\n(Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more)\nTexture: sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nBs horizon\nHue: 7.5YR\nValue: 3 to 5\nChroma: 4\nTexture: sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogs.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 4 to 6\nChroma: 2 or 3\n(Colors of 4/3, 5/3, or 6/3 have value dry of 7 or more)\nTexture: sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam.\nParkfalls soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).
