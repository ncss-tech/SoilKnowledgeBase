  "REVDATE": "04/2006",
  "STATES": "WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Parkfalls series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils which are deep to a densic contact. These soils formed in loamy alluvium underlain by dense sandy or loamy lodgement till on disintegration moraines. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the loamy alluvium, moderately slow in the lower part, and slow in the dense till. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Content of clay averages from 7 to 17 percent in the particle-size control section and in the argillic horizon. The content of sand coarser than very fine averages 35 to 70 percent. Coarse fragments are dominantly of igneous origin and are of mixed lithology. Total volume of rock fragment ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the upper part of the loamy alluvium, 0 to 25 percent in the lower part, and 5 to 35 percent in the dense till. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 20 percent in the loamy alluvium and from 5 to 35 percent in the dense till. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent and volume of stones ranges from 0 to 3 percent throughout. Surface stones have coverage ranging from 0 to 3 percent. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the loamy alluvium, but ranges to neutral where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part of the loamy alluvium and from strongly acid to neutral in the dense till. Masses of iron accumulations are in the spodic horizon within 20 inches of the mineral soil surface.
