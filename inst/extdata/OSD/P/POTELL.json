  "OVERVIEW": "The Potell series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loess.  Potell soils are on uplands, mountain footslopes and terraces, and have slopes of 0 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 60 to 66 degrees F.  The soils are usually dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 50 to 75 percent of time that the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F.  The 10- to 40-inch control section is silt or silt loam and contains 8 to 18 percent clay, and less than 15 percent particles coarser than fine sand.  The A and C1 horizons are mildly or moderately alkaline.  The C2 and Cca horizons are moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe Ap horizon, or the upper horizons when mixed to a depth of 7 inches, has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 dry and 2 moist.  In most pedons, the A horizon is slightly or moderately calcareous, but in some undisturbed pedons the upper few inches are noncalcareous.\nThe C1 and C2 horizons have value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  Structure is weak blocky or prismatic.  These layers are commonly moderately calcareous, with slightly more carbonates than the A horizon.\nThe Cca horizon is strongly calcareous below a depth of 8 to 20 inches, but lime content does not decrease as much as 5 percent above a depth of 6 feet.  These layers have few carbonate segregations and about 5 to 15 percent hard or very hard rounded nodules of soil material or (cicada) krotovinas."

The soils formed in deep calcareous loess.  Slopes are 0 to 75 percent, but are dominantly less than 30 percent.  Summers are hot and dry and winters are cool and moist.  The semiarid climate has an annual precipitation of 8 to 13 inches and an average annual temperature of about 41 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
