  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 60 to 66 degrees F.  The soils are usually dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 50 to 75 percent of time that the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F.  The 10- to 40-inch control section is silt or silt loam and contains 8 to 18 percent clay, and less than 15 percent particles coarser than fine sand.  The A and C1 horizons are mildly or moderately alkaline.  The C2 and Cca horizons are moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe Ap horizon, or the upper horizons when mixed to a depth of 7 inches, has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 dry and 2 moist.  In most pedons, the A horizon is slightly or moderately calcareous, but in some undisturbed pedons the upper few inches are noncalcareous.\nThe C1 and C2 horizons have value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  Structure is weak blocky or prismatic.  These layers are commonly moderately calcareous, with slightly more carbonates than the A horizon.\nThe Cca horizon is strongly calcareous below a depth of 8 to 20 inches, but lime content does not decrease as much as 5 percent above a depth of 6 feet.  These layers have few carbonate segregations and about 5 to 15 percent hard or very hard rounded nodules of soil material or (cicada) krotovinas."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Potell soils are on south and west slopes of rolling upland or mountain footslopes, terraces, and benchlands.  Elevations range from 4,500 to 5,700 feet. The soils formed in deep calcareous loess.  Slopes are 0 to 75 percent, but are dominantly less than 30 percent.  Summers are hot and dry and winters are cool and moist.  The semiarid climate has an annual precipitation of 8 to 13 inches and an average annual temperature of about 41 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
