  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is 60 inches or more deep and is weakly stratified.  The mean annual soil temperature is 61 degrees to 62 degrees F.  The soil is saturated in a reduced state at some time of the year.  Organic matter is 1 to 2 percent in the surface horizon and decreases to about 0.5 percent at 23 inches, but the decrease is irregular with increasing depth.  The soil ranges from slightly saline-alkali to strongly saline-alkali and is noneffervescent.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 5Y 4/1, 5/1 or 5/2 and moist color of 5Y 2.5/2, 3/1 or 3/2.  Faint to prominent mottles are in the lower part of the A horizon and have color of 7.5YR 5/6 or 5Y 5/6.  Gypsum crystals are present in pores and on faces of peds.  This horizon is neutral to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 5Y 4/1, 4/2, 5/1, 5/2 or 6/1 and moist color of 5Y 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 4/2 or 5/1.  There are faint, distinct, or prominent mottles that have color of 7.5YR 5/6; 5Y 2.5/1, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4 or 5/6.  This horizon is clay loam or clay and averages more than 35 percent clay.  It is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

Eagleville soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Egbert soils have a mollic epipedon more than 24 inches thick and have mixed mineralogy.  Merced soils have a regular decrease in organic carbon.  Omni and Tulare soils are effervescent throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pitco soils are on flood plains or basin rims.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium from igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Elevations are 190 to 210 feet.  The climate is arid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 6 to 7 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 45 degrees F.; mean July temperature is about 82 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 250 to 275 days."
