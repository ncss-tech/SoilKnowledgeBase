  "OVERVIEW": "The Pitco series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Pitco soils are on flood plains or basin rims and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",

The soil is saturated in a reduced state at some time of the year.  Organic matter is 1 to 2 percent in the surface horizon and decreases to about 0.5 percent at 23 inches, but the decrease is irregular with increasing depth.  The soil ranges from slightly saline-alkali to strongly saline-alkali and is noneffervescent.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 5Y 4/1, 5/1 or 5/2 and moist color of 5Y 2.5/2, 3/1 or 3/2.  Faint to prominent mottles are in the lower part of the A horizon and have color of 7.5YR 5/6 or 5Y 5/6.  Gypsum crystals are present in pores and on faces of peds.  This horizon is neutral to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 5Y 4/1, 4/2, 5/1, 5/2 or 6/1 and moist color of 5Y 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 4/2 or 5/1.  There are faint, distinct, or prominent mottles that have color of 7.5YR 5/6; 5Y 2.5/1, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4 or 5/6.  This horizon is clay loam or clay and averages more than 35 percent clay.  It is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline."
