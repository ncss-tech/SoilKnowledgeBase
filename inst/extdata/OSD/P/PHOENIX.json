  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist but is dry between 4 and 12 inches for 80 to 110 consecutive days in the 4 months following the summer solstice.  The soil profile opens and closes once a year.  Slickensides are close enough to intersect in all or in some parts between depths of 10 and 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F.  Depth to soft rock is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section is 60 to 70 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent gravel.  Color value moist is 4 or more in the upper 12 inches in more than half of each pedon.  Chroma is 1 or less within the upper 20 inches of the solum.\nThe Ap and Bss1 horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3.5 or 4 moist and dry and chroma of 1 moist, 1 or 2 dry.\nThe Bss2 and Bss3  horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist and dry and chroma of neutral to 2 moist and dry."
