  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

These soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Solum thickness ranges from 25 to 45 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick. The particle-size control section is 10 to 15 percent clay and averages 0 to 10 percent coarse fragments but any substratum horizon may contain up to 30 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma fo 2 or 3 dry of moist.  It is very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Coarse fragment range from 0 to 10 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral. The Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y moist, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 10 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  The upper part of the C horizon to a depth of about 40 inches, is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, gravelly fine sandy loam, or gravelly sandy loam and has 0 to 20 percent coarse fragments.  The lower part of the C horizon is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, gravelly fine sandy loam, or gravelly loamy fine sand.  It has 0 to 20 percent coarse fragments.  It is massive or single grained.  Reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline."

Ardening soils have 15 to 35 percent weathered schist fragments in the particle-size control section and are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days.  Billyridge soils are dry 60 to 75 consecutive days.  Canderly soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 56 degrees F.  Cotelli, Ginnis, Shangland, Spokane, and Usk soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Conconully and Rebecca soils have 15 to 35 percent pebbles in the control section. Crouch soils have a mean annual soil temperature of about 55 degrees F. Donavan and Hellgate soils are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days. Fanal soils have mottles in the lower B and C horizons.  Wind River soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 50 to 54 degrees F, and a solum of 15 to 25 inches thick."

These soils formed in glaciofluvial material.  They occur in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches.  The average January temperature is about 24 degrees F, average July temperature is about 70 degrees F, and the average annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.
