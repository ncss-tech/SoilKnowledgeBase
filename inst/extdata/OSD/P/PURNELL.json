  "OVERVIEW": "The Purnell series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils located on estuarine and coastal tidal marshes of the mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain. They formed in aeolian and marine sediments that are flooded twice daily by tidal waters.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 44 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the organic surface layer and depth to the sandy materials range from 8 to 16 inches.  Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline in undisturbed profiles but ranges from ultra acid to extremely acid upon drying.  Electrical conductivity is greater than 8 mmhos/cm (5.6 ppt).\nThe Oi horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 2 through 4, and a chroma of 1 or 3.  It is peat.  The fiber content after rubbing is greater than three-fourths of the soil volume. Mineral material content, by weight, ranges from 20 to 60 percent.\nThe Oe horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is mucky peat..  The fiber content after rubbing ranges from one-sixth to three-fourths of the volume.  Mineral content, by weight, ranges from 25 to 70 percent.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5GY, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 2. It is sand, coarse sand or loamy sand."

Pawcatuck soils have organic soil materials ranging from 16 to 51 inches in depth.  Carteret soils do not have a histic epipedon and are thermic.  Matunuck soils have a mean annual temperature of 49 degrees F., and are in a significantly different MLRA."

Typically, they occur on the bayside marshes of barrier islands and near ocean coastal inlets.   They formed in sandy marine and aeolian sediments that are flooded twice daily by tidal waters.   Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 48 inches."

Pawcatuck and Westbrook soils have 16 to 51 inches of organic soil materials and are commonly intermingled with Purnell soils.  Transquaking has greater than 51 inches of organic soil materials and occur at slightly lower elevations in the marsh."

    "section": "REMARKS",

They become extremely to ultra acid when drained.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Histic epipedon: the zone between 0 and 13 inches.\nb.  Fibric soil material: the zone between 0 and 3 inches has a fiber content after rubbing that is three-fourths of the soil volume.\nc.  Hemic soil material: the zone between 3 and 13 inches has a fiber content after rubbing that is one-half of the soil volume.\nd.  Moist incubation study indicates these soils have sulfidic materials."
