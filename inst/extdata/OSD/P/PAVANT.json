These soils are moist in the moisture control section more than 50 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F., and are continually dry for more than 60 consecutive days during the summer months in more than 7 out of 10 years.\nThe soil is 12 to 20 inches deep over an indurated calcium carbonate cemented hardpan.  The particle size control section contains 0 to 15 percent rock fragments which are dominantly gravel and cobble size.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  This horizon is slightly to strongly effervescent.  This horizon is moderately to strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 3 through 6 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  Clay content is 18 to 27 percent.  It is moderately to strongly alkaline."

These soils formed in alluvium dominantly from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  The climate is dry subhumid. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is about 64 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 140 days. Average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 7 inches. (A horizon and Bk1 horizon).\nCalcic horizon - the zone of carbonate accumulation from 4 to 17 inches (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).\nPetrocalcic horizon - the indurated lime cemented layer at 17 inches.  (Bkm horizon)\nIn Utah this series is correlated with Upland range sites.\nSeries was reclassified from Aridic Petrocalcic Palexerolls to Petrocalcic Palexerolls in 9/94.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
