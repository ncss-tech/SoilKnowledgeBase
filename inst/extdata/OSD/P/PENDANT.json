  "OVERVIEW": "The Pendant series consists of shallow, well drained or somewhat excessively drained soils on mountain slopes, ridges, cuestas, and pediments.  These soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from limestone.  Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

These soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from limestone, typically of Ordovician age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 59 to 65 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is 80 to 120 days."

The 02/2010 revision removes very shallow depths and changes the classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haplustolls to Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic Aridic Lithic Haplustolls. Vegetation of ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir forest has been deleted from the series concept."
