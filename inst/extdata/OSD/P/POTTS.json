  "OVERVIEW": "The Potts series consists of deep or very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or slope alluvium derived mainly from redbed shale and sandstone. Potts soils are on alluvial fans, benches, cuestas, pediments and strike valleys. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 305 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
