  "OVERVIEW": "The Potts series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from redbed shale and sandstone.  Potts soils are on alluvial fans and valley filling sideslopes and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

Gravel is usually less than 5 percent and ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  This horizon is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  This horizon is loam or clay loam; but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 20 to 55 percent, sand from 15 to 45 percent with less than 35 percent but more than 15 percent being fine sand or coarser.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline.  It has some oriented clay films on peds and in root channels.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 15 percent.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent."

Balon soils are noncalcareous.  Bowbac, Cushman, Fattig, Gaddes, Hagerman, Pokeman, Progresso, and Pugsley soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Cerrillos, Clovis, Scholle, Tapia, and Toluca soils have a calcic horizon.  Fort Collins, Olney, and Stoneham soils have hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR.  Harbord soils have a polygenetic solum in which a modern soil rests upon and merges with a planosol.  Los Alamos soils are underlain at depths of 20 to 40 inches by pumice deposits.  Maysdorf soils have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR in the lower part of the Bt horizon.  Millett soils have gravelly and very gravelly C horizons.  Penistaja soils have more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the B2t horizon.  Spenlo soils lack Bk horizons above 40 inches."

The soils formed in calcareous reddish brown sediments of low aggregate stability derived principally from redbed shale and sandstone.  At the type location average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the spring and summer.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 66 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 95 to 125 days."
