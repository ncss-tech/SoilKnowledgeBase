  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the cemented pan ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 to 52 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but they are dry in all parts between depths of 8 to 24 inches for 60 to 80 consecutive days following the summer solstice in most years.  The control section has 50 to 75 percent sand and 10 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist and 6 or 7 dry.  It is gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam, or gravelly loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR in the upper part and 10YR or 2.5Y in the lower part.  It has value 3 through 6 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  Texture is gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loam.  Some pedons have common fine faint and distinct redox concentrations.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y.  In some pedons, there are common medium distinct redox concentrations along fracture planes."
