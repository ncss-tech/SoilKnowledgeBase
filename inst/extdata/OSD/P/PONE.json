  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum thickness ranges from 26 to 40 inches. Depth to the discontinuity is typically greater than 40 inches.  Rock fragments of fine gravel range from 0 to 5 percent in the solum and 0 to 15 percent in the substratum. The soil ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid in unlimed areas and slightly acid to neutral in heavily limed areas.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2. It is mucky sandy loam, mucky loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. The texture is commonly sandy loam or loam, but some pedons have thin layers of sandy clay loam.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loamy sand or sandy loam.\nThe Cg horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 8, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sand or loamy sand.\nThe 2Cg horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 3. It is very fine sandy loam through silty clay loam. The 2Cg horizon is commonly above 50 inches but may be present below 50 inches in some pedons. Some pedons have a buried A horizon (high in organic matter) below 60 inches."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other known series in the same family. Similar soils in other families are the Keansburg, Kentuck, Fallsington, Pocomoke, Portsmouth and Rutlege soils. The Pocomoke, Portsmouth and Rutlege soils all have thermic temperature regimes. The Keansburg and Fallsington soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section. The Kentuck soils have a fine-silty particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pone soils are on level or nearly level uplands and narrow floodplains, and slightly concave closed depressions of the mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain. They formed in woody organic deposits overlying unconsolidated, stratified alluvial and marine sediments. Mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 48 inches. Elevation at the type location is about 32 feet."

Fort Mott soils do not have mottles with chroma of 2 or less, above 40 inches and are located on higher landscape positions. The Hammonton, Klej, and Woodstown soils do not have mottles with chroma of 2 or less above 12 inches and are located on slightly higher landscape positions.
