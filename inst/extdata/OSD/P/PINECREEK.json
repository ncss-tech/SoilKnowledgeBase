  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinecreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains. They formed in material weathered from metasedimentary rock with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Slopes are 25 to 75 percent. The average annual air temperature is about 7.2 degrees C and the average annual precipitation is about 760mm.",
