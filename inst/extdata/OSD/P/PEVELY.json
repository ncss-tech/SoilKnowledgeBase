  "OVERVIEW": "The Pevely series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from sandstone.  These soils are on hillslopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 40 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches.",
