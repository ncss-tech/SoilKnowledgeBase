    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Crispy, Cucamungo, Grandridge, Pinwheeler, Quopant, and Trailamp series.\nCrispy soils have rock fragments which are metamorphic rocks and have paralithic materials of weathered schist or gneiss in the series control section.  Cucamungo and Grandridge soils are dominated by fine gravel (2 to 5 mm diameter) of granitic lithology in the particle-size control section and have paralithic materials of weathered granitic rock in the series control section.  Pinwheeler soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Quopant soils have 2C horizons below the argillic horizon with less than 35 percent rock fragments.  Trailamp soils are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline, have paralithic contacts at depths of 18 to 36 cm, have paralithic materials of siltstone or shale in the series control section, and are intermittently moist due to summer convection storms."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pinew soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,620 to 2,750 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 410 to 610 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 20 cm (A1, A2, and Bt1 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 8 to 38 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 38 cm to underlying soft bedrock (Cr layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 8 to 38 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nThe revision of October 2003 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid, shallow Typic Argixerolls.  The isotic mineralogy class was based solely on the field determined values for sodium fluoride pH.  Laboratory data on 15 bar water to clay ratio does not exist to verify the isotic mineralogy class.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
