    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 14 inches.  Depth to carbonates is 16 inches or less with carbonates at the surface in many pedons.  The CaCO3 equivalent ranges from 25 to 40 percent below the Bk horizon.  The thickness of the upper mantle ranges from 0 to 20 inches thick.  The particle size control section averages 5 to 15 percent rock fragments.  Lag lines are in the upper sediment or at the contact with the till in some pedons.  They are sandy or gravelly and contain up to 35 percent rock fragments.  The fragments are of mixed lithology, but limestone and granite are dominant components.  Some areas have numerous cobbles, stones, or boulders on the surface.  Total clay content of the series control section ranges to over 18 percent but noncarbonate clay content is less than 18 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam sandy clay loam or their mucky analogues in the depressional phases.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a thin Bg horizon in the upper sediments.  Where present, it has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is gravelly loamy sand, gravelly loamy fine sand, gravelly fine sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, or gravelly loam.  Some pedons have 2Bk horizons.\nThe Bk and 2Bk horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  They are fine sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam or loam. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 30 to 45 percent.  Redoximorphic features are in all parts.\nThe C or 2C horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  They are fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.  They are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 25 to 40 percent.  Distinct or prominent redoximorphic features are in all parts."
