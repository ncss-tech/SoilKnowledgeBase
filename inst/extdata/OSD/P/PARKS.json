The soil is usually moist, but is dry to a depth of 21 inches or deeper for 45 to 90 days from July 1 to September 30. Rock fragments consists of stones, cobbles and pebbles throughout the profile.  The base saturation is 60 percent or more in some part of the soil between depths of 10 and 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 4/6, 5/8 or 5YR 4/6 and moist color of 7.5YR 3/6, 4/4, 5YR 4/4, 4/6 or 2.5YR 3/4.  It is loam, silt loam or sandy clay loam with 18 to 27 percent clay modified by 35 to 40 percent rock fragments.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/6, 7.5YR 5/6, 4/6 or 5YR 5/6 and moist color of 10YR 4/6, 7.5YR 4/6, 4/4 or 5YR 4/6.

The soils formed in material weathered from ultramafic rocks such as peridotite.  The elevation ranges from 5,000 to 6,400 feet.  The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 50 to 70 inches.  Snowfall averages 15 to 25 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 37 to 44 degrees F., mean January temperature is 28 degrees F. and mean July temperature is 61 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is 80 to 150 days."
