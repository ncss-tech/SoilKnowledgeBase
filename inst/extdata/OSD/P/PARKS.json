The soil is usually moist, but is dry to a depth of 21 inches or deeper for 45 to 90 days from July 1 to September 30. Rock fragments consists of stones, cobbles and pebbles throughout the profile.  The base saturation is 60 percent or more in some part of the soil between depths of 10 and 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 4/6, 5/8 or 5YR 4/6 and moist color of 7.5YR 3/6, 4/4, 5YR 4/4, 4/6 or 2.5YR 3/4.  It is loam, silt loam or sandy clay loam with 18 to 27 percent clay modified by 35 to 40 percent rock fragments.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/6, 7.5YR 5/6, 4/6 or 5YR 5/6 and moist color of 10YR 4/6, 7.5YR 4/6, 4/4 or 5YR 4/6.
