  "OVERVIEW": "The Perilla series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in fan alluvium from mixed sources.  Perilla soils are on fan and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.",
