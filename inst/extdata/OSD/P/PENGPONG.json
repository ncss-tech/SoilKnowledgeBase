  "OVERVIEW": "The Pengpong series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian material derived from mixed rocks.  Pengpong soils are on stabilized parna dunes.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
