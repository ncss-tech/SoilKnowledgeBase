  "OVERVIEW": "The Peaked series consists of very deep, moderately-well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and mudstone. Peaked soils are on mountains and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1525 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.",
