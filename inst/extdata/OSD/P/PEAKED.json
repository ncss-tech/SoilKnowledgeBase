    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevations are 0 to 1100 meters. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone and mudstone. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1270 to 2030 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 280 days."
