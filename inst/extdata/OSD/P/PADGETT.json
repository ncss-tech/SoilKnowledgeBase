  "OVERVIEW": "The Padgett series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in recent clayey alluvium derived from Permian age sediments. These nearly level soils are on flood plains of wide creeks. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches.",
