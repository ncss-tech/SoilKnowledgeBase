  "OVERVIEW": "The Polecat series consists of deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium and residuum from lacustrine deposits. Polecat soils have slopes of 4 to 65 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
