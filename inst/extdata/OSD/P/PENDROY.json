  "OVERVIEW": "The Pendroy series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in clayey glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine material or in alluvium from shale uplands.  These soils are on alluvial fans, floodplains, stream terraces, and lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
