  "OVERVIEW": "The Parquat series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium derived from volcanic sources.  Parquat soils are on hills and fan terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches; and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
