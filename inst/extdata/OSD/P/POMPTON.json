  "OVERVIEW": "The Pompton series consists of very deep, moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained soils formed in water-sorted sediments. They are on outwash plains, relict beaches, and terraces in waterways and low positions. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the solum and high or very high in the substratum. Mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees Celsius and mean annual precipitation is about 1270 millimeters.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 60 to 100 centimeters. Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent through the solum and from 0 to 75 percent in individual horizons in the C horizon. The particle-size control section averages less than 35 percent coarse fragments. Rounded pebbles are dominant but angular pebbles and rounded or angular cobblestones and stones also occur. Rock fragments are primarily composed of granitic gneiss with lesser amounts of sandstone, shale and quartzite. Mineralogy is dominated by quartz, feldspars, and micas, with lesser amounts of dark opaque minerals. Depth to low chroma iron depletions ranges from 40 to 60 centimeters. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout unless limed.\nThe A horizons have hues of 7.5YR or 10YR, values of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. They are sandy loam to silt loam and gravelly analogues. They have weak to moderate fine or medium granular structure and are friable to very friable. Uncultivated areas have A horizons commonly 2 to 12 centimeters thick but the range includes up to 18 centimeters in some places.\nA BA horizon up to 15 centimeters thick is present in some pedons.\nThe B horizons have hues of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, values of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. Some pedons have chroma 2 in the lower part of the B. They have yellowish red (5YR 5/6) to yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) and gray (10YR 6/1) to olive (5Y 4/3) redoximorphic features. The BA and Bw horizons are fine sandy loam, sandy loam or gravelly or cobbly analogues and the BC horizons are sandy loam, loamy sand or gravelly or cobbly analogues. The B horizons have fine or medium subangular blocky to moderate subangular blocky or granular structure. They are friable to very friable.\nThe C horizons have hues of 7.5YR to 5Y, values of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 6. They are stratified and texture ranges from sand to sandy loam or gravelly and cobbly analogues. The transition zone between contrasting textures is more than 12 centimeters thick."

Chautauqua and Wapping soils have more than 60 percent silt plus very fine sand in the subsoil. Pittstown, Rainbow, Wilbraham, and Woodbridge soils have a densic contact. Sutton soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pompton soils are nearly level to sloping soils on broad outwash plains, relict beaches, deltaic deposits, and in slightly concave drainageways that dissect outwash terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent, but are commonly 0 to 5 percent. The soils developed in water sorted sandy and gravelly materials dominated by granitic gneiss with lesser amounts of many other kinds of materials. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 100 to 125 centimeters. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 10 degrees Celsius. The frost-free days range from 140 to 160 days."

The well drained Riverhead soils, moderately well drained Horseneck soils with a water table typically at about 56 centimeters, somewhat poorly drained Red Hook, and the poorly drained Preakness soils form a typical drainage topo-sequence. Boonton, Haledon and Rockaway soils are on uplands."

Cambic horizon - from 18 to 86 centimeters (Bw1, Bw2, and BC horizons).\n2. Aquic feature - low chroma iron depletions from 43 to 64 centimeters (Bw2 horizon).\nUse of Pompton in MLRA's 101 and 139 should be evaluated, as coarse fragments in those pedons are clearly dominated by sandstone and shale rather than granitics.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
