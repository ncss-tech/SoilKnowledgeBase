  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Soil thickness and depth to weathered limestone bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Soil reaction is moderately alkaline throughout.\nA thin layer of organic material covers the A horizon in some pedons.  Where present, it has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is muck.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, or gray range from none to common.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown, or yellow range from none to common.  Texture is silt loam or silt.\nThe Cg horizon has the same range of colors and textures as the Bg horizon.  A Thin layer of black to gray sand, fine sand, or black muck is at the base of the C horizon in some pedons.\nThe 2Cr horizon is soft to hard limestone and can be easily excavated with light power equipment.  Solution holes range from few to common and extend 1 to 2 feet into the limestone. They are filled with sand, silt loam, or soft carbonatic material."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Perrine soils are in broad low flats near the Atlantic Ocean in southeastern Florida.  Slopes are less than 1 percent.  They formed in deposits of sediments that are 90 to 90 percent calcium carbonate and are on the Miami Oolite Formation of the Pleistocene Age.  They are at elevations of 1 to 4 feet above sea level.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 55 to 65 inches and the average annual air temperature ranges from 73 to 75 degrees F."
