    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 14 inches. Depth to continuous horizons of continuous carbonate accumulation ranges from 10 to 19 inches. Bedrock depth ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Mean annual soil temperature is 35 to 42 degrees F. Mean summer soil temperature is 50 to 59 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. Channers range from 0 to 15 percent. It is slightly acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is clay loam or loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 but less than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand. Channers range from 0 to 15 percent. It is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is loam, clay loam, channery loam, or channery clay loam with channers ranging from 0 to 20 percent. Calcium carbonate ranges from 6 to 14 percent with isolated pockets ranging up to 20 percent but these are discontinuous. It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline. Some pedons have a thin layer with very cobbly or extremely cobbly modifiers just above the lithic contact."

The Accola, Amsden, Croftshaw, Crydon, Dewville, Gebson, Gelkie, Hourglass, Kittredge, Leavitt, Lyonman, Michelson, Monaberg, Monad, Morset, Newlands, Oro Fino, Philipsberg, Swede, Tingy, Wellsville, and Youga series are very deep. The Buffork, Cific, Inchau, Lymanson, Rainbolt, Tripit, Troutdale, and Zade series have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. The Dra and Rammel soils have continuous horizons of carbonate accumulation at depths greater than 20 inches. Kezar soils have more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the Bt horizon. Barbarela, Coldspring, Lucky, Mult, Shotgun and Slacks soils are noncalcareous throughout. Miracle soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the Bt horizon. Primeaux soils have 35 to 60 percent coarse fragments in the lower Bt horizon and have slightly acid reactions throughout the Bt. Woosley soils formed over limestone and are greater than 20 inches to the base of the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Passcreek soils are on mountainslopes, canyon walls, and cuestas. They formed in colluvial slopewash and residuum derived from calcareous sandstone. Slopes are 3 to 60 percent. Elevations are 5500 to over 9,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches but ranges from 17 to 28 inches. The mean annual temperature ranges from 36 to 42 degrees F. The frost-free season is less than 80 days, and frost may occur during any month at the higher elevations."
