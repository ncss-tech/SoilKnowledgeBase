  "OVERVIEW": "The Picosa series consists of very shallow to shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils.  These soils formed in tuffaceous weakly cemented sandstone bedrock interbedded with claystone of the Jackson Group.  These nearly level to hilly soils are on uplands.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent but are mainly 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 736 mm (29 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).",
