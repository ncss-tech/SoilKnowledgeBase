  "OVERVIEW": "The Padonia series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess over clayey residuum weathered from calcareous shales. Padonia soils are on uplands. Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 86 centimeters (34 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).",
