  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the duripan is 5 to 20 inches.  Depth to hard fractured basalt is 8 to 24 inches. The control section averages 30 to 35 percent clay.  The mean annual soil temperature at the top of the duripan is about 45 to 55 degrees F. and the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. from February 20 to January 1.  The soil temperature exceeds 47 degrees F. from about April 1 to November 1.  The soil between depths of 4 to 12 inches or to the duripan is usually dry in all parts from June 1 until November 15 and is moist in some or all parts when the soil is above 47 degrees F. only from April to June 1 and from October 20 to November 1.  It is usually dry and is not moist more than 90 consecutive days when the soil temperatures exceed 47 degrees F., it is aridic but borders on xeric.  The soil is slightly acid or neutral throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon is pale brown or pinkish gray to grayish brown (10YR 6/3, 6/2, 5/3, 5/2; 7.5YR 6/2, 5/2) and has moist color of dark yellowish brown, brown or very dark grayish brown (10YR 4/4, 4/3, 4/2, 3/4, 3/3, 3/2; 5YR 4/4, 4/2, 3/4, 3/2).  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam and commonly is very stony or extremely stony.  This horizon has weak to moderately platy or subangular blocky structure or is massive, but not both massive and hard.  It is soft to hard and commonly is very friable or friable.\nThe B2t horizon is reddish yellow and brown to dark reddish gray (7.5YR 6/6, 6/4, 6/2, 5/6,5/2, 4/4, 4/2; 5YR 5/3, 5/2, 4/3,4/2) and has moist color of brown, dark brown, or dark reddish brown (7.5YR 4/4, 4/2, 3/4, 3/2; 5YR 3/3, 3/2).  It is heavy loam or clay loam in the upper part and has light clay or clay in the lower part as a thin intermittent layer on top of the duripan.  This horizon has weak subangular blocky to moderate blocky structure, with the stronger structure in the finer textured horizons.  It is hard, very firm, very plastic, and very sticky in the lower part.\nThe Csim horizon is massive or platy with thin continuous opal laminar layers in the upper part.  The lower part is massive and very firm when moist."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Acana, Ditchcamp, Deven, Exel, Thoms, Puls, and Wellington series.  Acana soils are mildly to very strongly alkaline, strongly or violently effervescent, and are underlain by duripans composed mostly of very thin laminae with an aggregate thickness from 1/4 to 1 inch.  Their mineralogy is strongly influenced by vitric pyroclastic materials and they have mean summer soil temperatures of 74 to 78 degrees F.  Ditchcamp soils have duripans, have mollic epipedons, and have basalt rock at depths greater than 20 inches.   Deven soils lack duripans, have mollic epipedons, and have basalt rock at depths of less than 20 inches.  Exel soils have duripans at depths greater than 20 inches and are underlain by stratified gravel and cobbles.  Thoms soils lack bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches and are underlain by stratified gravel and cobbles.  Puls soils have abrupt textural AB boundaries, and have clayey B2t horizons.  Wellington soils have duripans at depths of 20 to 36 inches and have A2 horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Packwood soils are on nearly level to gently rolling hummocky plateaus at elevations of 4,500 to 5,400 feet.  These soils commonly are in a complex and occupy the intermound positions and Ditchcamp soils occupy the mounds.  They formed in residuum weathered from basalt. Stones and cobblestones cover most of the surface.  In some places they are close enough to form nearly continuous pavement.  A stone line at the base of the mounds is common. The climate is cool semi-arid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches including 24 to 48 inches of snow. Average January temperature is 28 degrees F.; average July temperature is 67 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 46 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 80 to 110 days."
