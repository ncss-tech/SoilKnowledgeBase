  "OVERVIEW": "The Pesmore series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to bedrock.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvial slopewash weathered from schist, gneiss, and granite.  Pesmore soils are on cuesta dipslopes, mountain and hillslopes, and ridge crests.  Slopes range from 10 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock and lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick and contains 2 to 4 percent organic matter throughout.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F.  The particle-size control section has a matrix texture of loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, and less commonly sandy loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and 35 to 70 percent sand.  Muauous schist and granite make up a major part of the medium and coarse sand grains.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent coarse fragments of semirounded pebbles, channers, or cobble.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  Matrix texture is sandy loam or loam modified with 10 to 40 percent channers or pebbles.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  Matrix texture is typically loam, clay loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam with 15 to 60 percent pebbles or channers.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk and C horizons have hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6 dry and moist.  Matrix texture is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, and less commonly sandy loam with 35 to 60 percent pebbles or channers.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

Peso and Pesowyo soils formed in material weathered from limestone and occur in areas of 15- to 19-inch precipitation.  Sandia soils are neutral throughout and have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches.

The slope gradient is commonly 15 to 45 percent but the range is 10 to 90 percent.  The soils formed in medium textured material derived from Precambrian schist, gneiss, and granite.  The underlying rock is hard schist, gneiss, or granite.  Rock outcrop is common.  Elevation is 6,000 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  The estimated frost-free season is 85 to 110 days."
