  "OVERVIEW": "The Pollow series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and/or slope alluvium over residuum derived from conglomerate and sandstone.  Pollow soils are on canyon ledges.  Slopes range from 4 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 8.5 degrees C.",
