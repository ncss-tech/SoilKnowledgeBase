  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 25 to 40 inches.  Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum and strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.  Volume of gravel ranges from 1 to 10 percent in the solum and from 15 to 40 percent in the substratum.  Cobble content ranges from  10 to 30 percent in the surface horizons and from 5 to 25 percent in the subsoil and substratum.   Stones on the surface can cover from less than 0.01 to 3.0 percent of the surface.\nThe O horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR.  Some pedons have an A horizon  1  to 4 inches thick, with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR,  value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value of 4 or 5.  The A and E horizons are silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or the cobbly analogues of these textures.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 2 or 3.   The Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of  3  to 6.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together in this horizon.  The B horizons are  silt loam, silt loam, or the cobbly analogues of these textures.\nThe E' horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value of 5 or 6,   and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 or 6.  The E' and Bt horizons occur separately or in combination.  They are fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or cobbly analogs of these textures.\nThe 2C horizons have value of 4 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. These are loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or the  cobbly , gravelly or very gravelly analogs of these textures.  Some pedons have bright colored mottles in the lower subsoil and substratum."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Amasa, Champion, Fence, Goodman, and Stambaugh series.  The Amasa soil does not have an argillic horizon.  The Champion soil has a fragipan.  The Fence soils are underlain by layered silt and silt loams.  The Goodman series is in the coarse-silty family.  The Stambaugh soil is coarse-silty over sandy or sandy skeletal."

Slope gradients are dominantly 1 to  18  percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from  30 to 33 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from  41 to 43  degrees F."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: albic horizon - the zone from the surface to 2 inches and from 18 to 26 inches (E and E' horizons); spodic horizon - the zone from 2 to 18 inches (Bhs, Bs1, and Bs2 horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from 26 to 38 inches (Bt horizon).  The silty eolian surface material has been modified by windthrow activity and post glacial erosion.\nFor laboratory data see Michigan Technological University Pedon No.  S80MI-013-04.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
