  "OVERVIEW": "The Petticoat series consists of  very  deep, well drained  and moderately well drained  soils on ground moraines.  They formed in modified  silty eolian material and in the underlying sandy glacial till.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the pedon and moderately rapid in the lower part.  Slopes range from 1 to  18 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 25 to 40 inches.  Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum and strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.  Volume of gravel ranges from 1 to 10 percent in the solum and from 15 to 40 percent in the substratum.  Cobble content ranges from  10 to 30 percent in the surface horizons and from 5 to 25 percent in the subsoil and substratum.   Stones on the surface can cover from less than 0.01 to 3.0 percent of the surface.\nThe O horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR.  Some pedons have an A horizon  1  to 4 inches thick, with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR,  value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value of 4 or 5.  The A and E horizons are silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or the cobbly analogues of these textures.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 2 or 3.   The Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of  3  to 6.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together in this horizon.  The B horizons are  silt loam, silt loam, or the cobbly analogues of these textures.\nThe E' horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value of 5 or 6,   and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 or 6.  The E' and Bt horizons occur separately or in combination.  They are fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or cobbly analogs of these textures.\nThe 2C horizons have value of 4 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. These are loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or the  cobbly , gravelly or very gravelly analogs of these textures.  Some pedons have bright colored mottles in the lower subsoil and substratum."

The Amasa soil does not have an argillic horizon.  The Champion soil has a fragipan.  The Fence soils are underlain by layered silt and silt loams.  The Goodman series is in the coarse-silty family.  The Stambaugh soil is coarse-silty over sandy or sandy skeletal."
