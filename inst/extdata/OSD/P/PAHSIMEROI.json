  "OVERVIEW": "The Pahsimeroi series consists of very deep soils with sand and gravel at shallow depths.  They are somewhat excessively drained soils that formed on outwash fans and fan terraces from alluvium derived from quartzite.  Permeability is moderate over very rapid.  They have slopes of 2 to 20 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
