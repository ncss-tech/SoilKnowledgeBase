  "OVERVIEW": "The Pimsby series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium from arkose.  Pimsby soils are on hills on half grabens.  Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
