  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pattenbutte series consists of shallow, well drained soils on backslopes and shoulder slopes of mountains. Pattenbutte soils formed in colluvium from granite with a minor influence of volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches and mean annual air temperature about 33 degrees F.",
