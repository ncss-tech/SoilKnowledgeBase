These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources, mainly metamorphic rock or volcanic rock, with a component of reworked loess.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,975 to 2,550 meters.  The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and cool dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm; mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 50 to 90 days."
