  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is from 40 to more than 80 inches.  The soil ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A horizon and from moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the B and C horizons.  Limestone cobbles and boulders range from none to few throughout the soil.  Soil temperature is 72 degrees to 74 degrees F., at depths of 20 inches below the soil surface.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 5. It is less than 6 inches thick if value is 3 or less. Texture is fine sand, or loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 or 6. Texture is fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 7.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, or red range from few to many.  Texture is sandy clay or clay.  Clay content in the upper 20 inches of this horizon is 35 to 60 percent; silt content is less than 30 percent.\nThe BCg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 7.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, or red range from few to common.  Texture is sandy clay or clay.  Bodies of soft, white (10YR 8/1, 8/2) carbonatic material or semi-hard calcareous concretions range from none to common in the lower Btg and BCg horizons.\nThe Cg horizon has the same color and textural ranges as the B3 horizon and has common or many, medium and large pockets of soft, white (10YR 8/1, 8/2) carbonatic material.  Many pedons are underlain by soft carbonatic material or semi-hard lime material at depths of 60 or more inches."
