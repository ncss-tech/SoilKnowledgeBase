  "OVERVIEW": "The Pecktonville series consist of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils. They formed in residuum from limestone with interbedded shale, chert, and sandstone. They occur on upland ridges. Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent. Mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 38 to 50 inches.",
