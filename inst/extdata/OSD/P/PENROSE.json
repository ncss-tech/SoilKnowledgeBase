  "OVERVIEW": "The Penrose series consists of shallow, well and somewhat excessively drained,\nmoderate to slowly permeable soils formed in thin, calcareous, loamy materials\nweathered in place from limestone and interbedded limy materials.  Penrose soils are on hills, plains, ridges, hogbacks, cuestas, and mesa tops.  Slopes are 1 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
