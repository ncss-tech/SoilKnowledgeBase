  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to  80 inches.   The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 45 percent.  The base saturation ranges from 35 to 60 percent in the argillic horizon.  Some subhorizon has dominant colors with chroma of 3 or more in the upper 30 inches of the solum.  Ironstone fragments or nodules and iron-manganese concretions range from few to common in some part of the solum of most pedons.  The redox features are mainly contemporary.  It is wet for extended periods in the surface and upper part of the argillic horizon.  The soil has aquic soil conditions during most years.\nThe A horizon has colors in shades of brown or gray in hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.   Mollic colored horizons are less than 7 inches thick.  Texture is loam or clay loam.  The reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe BAg horizon is not diagnostic to the series.  When present, it has colors like the argillic horizon and texture like the A horizon.\nThe Btg horizon has colors in shades of gray and is commonly mixed with colors of brown, red, or yellow.  The gray colors have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The other colors have hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The texture is clay loam or clay.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe C horizon is weathered glauconitic materials, glauconitic marl, or glauconitic greensand or is straitfied  with these materials.  The texture of these geologic materials is mainly loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.  Clayey Bt soil materials range from none to about 40 percent by volume."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Percilla soils have concave surfaces.  They are in depressional areas on uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  These soils formed in materials from the Weches Geologic Formation.  Mean annual rainfall ranges from 42 to 52 inches and is evenly distributed throughout the year.  Mean annual temperature rages from 65 degrees to 68 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 235 to 250.  The elevation ranges from 300 to 650 feet above sea level.  Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 68 to 82."

Alto, Elrose, Nacogdoches, and Trawick soils are on higher positions in the landscape and are better drained.  Alto soils have a brownish argillic horizon.  Elrose, Nacogdoches, and Trawick soils have a red argillic horizon.  Attoyac and Chireno soils are slightly lower on terrace positions.  Attoyac soils have reddish subsoils and are well drained.  Chireno soils have a mollic epipedon."
