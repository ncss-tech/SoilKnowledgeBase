  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil typically is moderately acid to neutral in the upper part and slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part.  Some pedons have free carbonates beginning at depths of 30 inches or greater.  Content of rock fragments, mainly pebbles, ranges from 0 to 5 percent by volume.  The 10- to 40-inch particle-size control section has a weighted average clay content of 6 to 18 percent.  The content of organic matter and thickness of horizons are variable because of the nature of the parent materials.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5 and chroma of 1 or 2 or is neutral with value of 2.  In some pedons it does not have redoximorphic features.  The A horizons with moist value less than 3.5 are less than 6 inches thick.  The A horizon typically is very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam, but loam, silt loam, loamy very fine sand, and sandy loam are within the range.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and dominant chroma of 1 or 2; some thin subhorizons may have chroma of 3.  It has faint to prominent redoximorphic features.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, loamy very fine sand, and sandy loam.  Subhorizons of loamy fine sand, loamy sand and fine sand are in many pedons.  At depths below 40 inches most pedons have textures similar to those in the control section, but some have subhorizons of silty clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pengilly soils are on the nearly level parts of flood plains.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.  The soils formed in loamy alluvium.  Mean annual air temperature is 36 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 22 to 30 inches.  Frost-free days range from 88 to 120.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 800 to 1600 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Common adjacent soils are the Indus, Menahga, Nashwauk, and Nebish series.  Nashwauk and Nebish soils are moderately well or well drained, are on higher landscape positions and formed in loamy glacial till.  Indus soils are very fine.  The excessively drained Menahga soils formed in sandy outwash."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 4 inches (A horizon).   Color value is too low and chroma is too high for typic but it better represents the wet conditions.  Higher chromas may in part be due to oxygen enriched water moving to the soil.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Soil Interpretation Record:  MN0381.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
