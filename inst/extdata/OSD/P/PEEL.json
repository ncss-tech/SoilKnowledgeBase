The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F.  Depth to soft bedrock and the sola thickness are 20 to 40 inches.  The soils crack to the surface at some period in most years during the period following the solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 34 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.  It is gravelly clay or gravelly silty clay, averaging 40 to 55 percent clay.

The soils formed mainly in colluvium weathered from serpentinite or peridotite rocks.  The summers are warm and dry and the winters are cool and moist.  Mean annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.; average January temperature is about 39 degrees F.; and average July temperature is about 66 to 68 degrees F.  Average frost-free period is 150 to 220 days."
