  "OVERVIEW": "The Peel series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from serpentine or peridotite rocks.  Peel soils are on hillsides and footslopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry in the control section for 60 to 80 consecutive days during the 4-month period folowing the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F.  Depth to soft bedrock and the sola thickness are 20 to 40 inches.  The soils crack to the surface at some period in most years during the period following the solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 34 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.  It is gravelly clay or gravelly silty clay, averaging 40 to 55 percent clay.  Coarse fragments range from 15 to 35 percent gravel.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.
