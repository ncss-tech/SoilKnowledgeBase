The mean annual soil temperature is 51 to 55 degrees F. The solum is 40 to 60 inches thick. Depth to fractured bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Some pedons have up to 5 percent stones on the soil surface. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry. Texture is silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay. It has 5 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles and stones.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay. It has 10 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobbles.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay. It has 10 to 25 percent gravel and 5 to 20 percent cobbles. Below 60 inches the content of rock fragments may range from 40 to 75 percent. In some pedons there are buried argillic horizons above the bedrock and below the cambic horizons."

Slopes are 30 to 90 percent. Elevation is 240 to 2,200 feet. The soils formed in clayey basaltic colluvium derived dominantly from materials weathered from the Siletz River Volcanics formation. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 70 inches. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F. The January temperature is 38 to 40 F. and the mean July temperature is 64 to 67 degrees F. The frost-free period is 160 to 210 days."

MacDunn, Ritner and Witzel soils occur on steep to very steep side slopes of hills and mountains. Gelderman, Jory and Nekia soil shave argillic horizons. Yamhill soils have mollic epipedons and are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. MacDunn soils are fine textured, have more than 35 percent total rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Ritner soils are fine textured, have more than 35 percent total rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Witzel soils are shallower than 20 inches to a lithic contact and have more than 35 percent total rock fragments in the particle-size control section."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - from 1 to 17 inches (A, BA horizons). Dark colors in the modal A horizon do not meet umbric epipedon criteria for thickness.\nHumic subgroup - color requirements are meet from 1 to 54 inches\nCambic horizon - from a depth of 17 to 54 inches (Bw1, Bw2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section from 1 to 41 inches (part of the BA, all of the Bw1, and part of the Bw2 horizons).\nAll depths to diagnostic features in the range of characteristics are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nTypical pedon relocated based on field observations and documentation from several counties in the Willamette Valley update area. The modal concept reflects a soil that is very deep, has red hues, is fine textured, has less than 35 percent total rock fragments in the particle-size control section, does not have an argillic horizon and occurs dominantly on the Siletz River Volcanics geologic formation. Price soils occur on the Looney geomorphic surface. Lab data from the Price type location and of similar soils indicate a superactive CEC class and more than 60 percent base saturation (NH4OAc). This resulted in a change in classification to fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Humic Haploxerepts.\nADDITIONAL DATA; Characterization data available for National Soil Survey Lab soil survey sample numbers S00OR-003-013 and S55OR-003-001.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
