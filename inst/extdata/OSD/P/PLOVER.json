  "OVERVIEW": "The Plover series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in stratified loamy lacustrine deposits on stream terraces, glacial lake plains, ice walled lake basins and delta kames.  Permeability is moderate in the subsoil and moderately slow in the substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 60 inches.  Depth to stratification is less than 40 inches.  Coarse fragments typically are absent throughout but the volume of gravel ranges 0 to 15 percent in some horizons in some pedons.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum, but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.   Redox concentrations are throughout the pedon below the A horizon.  Redox depletions are in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon and saturation occurs there at some time in most years.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Ap and A horizon is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, or sandy loam.  Some uncultivated pedons do not have an A horizon.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is typically silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam, but in some pedons, is sandy loam or loamy fine sand.\nPlover soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part color and texture like the E horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 or 5. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 or 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam very fine sandy loam, or loam.  Thin strata of coarser or finer texture are in the lower part of the Bt horizon in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR and value and chroma of 4 to 6. It is stratified with silt, silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, very fine sand, fine sand, or sand."

These soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 to 2.5 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period October to June in 6 or more out of 10 years.  The water table is perched over stratified lacustrine sediments but in most years will eventually saturate the lacustrine sediments and exhibit an apparent water table."
