  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 60 inches.  Depth to stratification is less than 40 inches.  Coarse fragments typically are absent throughout but the volume of gravel ranges 0 to 15 percent in some horizons in some pedons.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum, but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.   Redox concentrations are throughout the pedon below the A horizon.  Redox depletions are in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon and saturation occurs there at some time in most years.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Ap and A horizon is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, or sandy loam.  Some uncultivated pedons do not have an A horizon.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is typically silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam, but in some pedons, is sandy loam or loamy fine sand.\nPlover soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part color and texture like the E horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 or 5. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 or 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam very fine sandy loam, or loam.  Thin strata of coarser or finer texture are in the lower part of the Bt horizon in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR and value and chroma of 4 to 6. It is stratified with silt, silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, very fine sand, fine sand, or sand."

Brennyville, Magnor, Mora, and Stinnett have a densic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Fllcreek, Hatley do not have stratification in the series control section.  Magroc soils have a lithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Rosy soils have carbonates in the series control section.  Oesterle soils have stratified sandy outwash within 40 inches."

These soils formed in stratified loamy lacustrine deposits.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 120 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 800 to 1950 feet."

The well drained Alban soils and the moderately well drained Aftad soils are in a drainage sequence with Plover soils.  The well drained Campia soils, the moderately well drained Crystal Lake soils, the somewhat poorly drained Comstock soils, and the poorly drained Barronett soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where there is more silt and clay, and less sand in the soil."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Surface runoff is slow or medium.   Permeability is moderate in the subsoil and moderately slow in the substratum.  These soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 to 2.5 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period October to June in 6 or more out of 10 years.  The water table is perched over stratified lacustrine sediments but in most years will eventually saturate the lacustrine sediments and exhibit an apparent water table."

Native vegetation is hardwood forest with scattered conifers.  Second growth forest of red maple, American basswood and yellow birch is common at the present time."
