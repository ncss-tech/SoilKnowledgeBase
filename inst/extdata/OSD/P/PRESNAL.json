  "OVERVIEW": "The Presnal series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in material from anorthosite with a mantle of mixed volcanic ash.  They are on mountain slopes and ridgetops.  Permeability is moderate and slopes are 15 to 70 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 43 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
