  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days within the four months following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 46 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 30 percent clay and 60 to 75 percent rock fragments.  Base saturation is assumed to be 50 to 70 percent. The upper 7 to 14 inches is estimated to have 20 to 30 percent volcanic glass and 0.4 to 1.0 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron.\nThe A horizon has a value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  It contains 60 to 70 percent channers. Organic matter is 2 to 4 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or clay loam and contains 60 to 75 percent channers."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soil formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rock with an influence of volcanic ash.  The climate is characterized by cold and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 25 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."
