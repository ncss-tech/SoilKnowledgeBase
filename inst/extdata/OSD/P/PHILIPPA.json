  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Philippa soils are in cirques on lateral moraines in mountains.  These soils formed in volcanic ash, colluvium, and ablation till over compact basal till.  Source rock is predominately andesite, granodiorite, metasediments and metavolcanics.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  Elevations range from 1,600 to 2,800 feet.  The climate is marine influenced with relatively cool, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 90 to 140 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season (32 degrees F) is 130 to 160 days.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 150 to 170 days."
