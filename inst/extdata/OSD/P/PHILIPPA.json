  "OVERVIEW": "The Philippa series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in volcanic ash, colluvium and ablation till over dense compact basal till.  These soils are in cirques and on lateral moraines in mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
