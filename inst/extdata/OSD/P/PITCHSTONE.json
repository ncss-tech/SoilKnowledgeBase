  "OVERVIEW": "The Pitchstone series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in stratified alluvium primarily from granite or other coarse grained igneous or metamorphic rocks.  These soils occur on valley bottoms, stream terraces, alluvial fans, and at the base of escarpments in valleys.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
