Rhame and Modess soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Anaconda and Cozberg soils have a calcic horizon.  Chinook soils have horizons of accumulated calcium carbonate within 10 to 35 inches of the surface. Ynot and Pring soils do not have a sandy or coarse sandy substratum. Tinytown soils have hues of 5YR to 10R in the particle-size control section."

They occur on more linear to convex landscape positions.  Rockerjohn soils have lime present in one or more subsoil horizons and have coarse sandy substrata within 9 to 23 inches of the soil surface. Rockerjohn soils tend to occur in areas containing more fine grained strata in subsoil layers between 40 to 80 inches, associated with more mixed Tertiary valley fill parent materials."
