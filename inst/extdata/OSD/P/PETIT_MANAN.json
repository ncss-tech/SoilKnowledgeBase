  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the organic deposits ranges from 20 to 40 cm. The soil ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline in its natural condition and ultra-acid to neutral once oxidized. The electrical conductivity (EC) ranges from 0.0 to 4.0 dS/m in a 1:5 soil to water mixture by volume. Salt content ranges from about 5,000 to 35,000 ppm. Some pedons may contain sea shells.\nThe O horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is typically comprised of hemic and sapric materials, but some pedons have fibric materials. Fiber content ranges from 25 through 90 percent, rubbed fiber content ranges from 10 to 65 percent. Organic matter content ranges from 20 to 90 percent.\nThe A horizon, where present, is neutral or has a hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Textures range from sandy loam to silty clay loam or their mucky modifier. It is 0 to 20 cm thick.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 10G, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture ranges from silt loam to silty clay. Shell fragments and herbaceous fibers are common."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Petit Manan soils are level and occur in tidal marshes along the coast of Maine. They are subject to tidal flooding twice daily except in areas protected by dikes, tide gates, or other restrictions. Petit Manan soils formed in thick fine-silty deposits beneath organic material. Mean annual temperature ranges from 5 to 9 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 1600 to 2200 mm."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fort Knox, Gouldsboro, Todds Point, Pemaquid, Phippsburg, and Damariscotta soils in nearby tidal marsh areas. Fort Knox soils have organic materials 40 to 130 cm thick and are underlain by loamy mineral materials. Gouldsboro soils are fine-silty mineral soils with a thin to absent organic cap less than 20 cm thick. Todds Point soils have organic materials greater than 130 cm thick and seldom have any mineral within 165 cm. Pemaquid soils have organic materials 40 to 130 cm thick and are underlain by sandy mineral materials. Phippsburg soils have an organic cap 20 to 40 cm thick and are underlain by sandy mineral materials. Damariscotta soils are sandy mineral soils with a thin to absent organic cap less than 20 cm thick."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in salt marsh and provide food and habitat for fish, shellfish, and wildfowl. Small scattered areas are used for saltgrass hay. The most common grasses are salt meadowgrass, salt water grass, and spike grass. Other vegetation includes blackgrass, sea lavender, saltwort, seaside goldenrod, aster, and purple gerardi. In areas where the 1:5 soil to water EC by volume is below 1.5 dS/m, vegetation consists principally of tall reeds and sedges."
