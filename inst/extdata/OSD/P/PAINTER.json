  "OVERVIEW": "The Painter series consists of moderately deep, excessively drained soils with rapid permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 35 to 90 percent in foothills and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

The Berent, Goldrun, Hotsprings, Incy, Quincy, Toll, Winchester and Zorravista soils are more than 40 inches deep. Quinton soils have fine sand or loamy fine sand textures in the particle-size control section, a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 56 degrees F and do not have A and Bw horizons. Lachim soils do not have a Bw horizon or a lithic contact at a depth of 24 to 40 inches. Rinquin soils are over semi-consolidated siltstone and the C horizon is fine sand or loamy fine sand that is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Walco soils are over basalt, do not have a paralithic contact and do not have a Bw horizon."
