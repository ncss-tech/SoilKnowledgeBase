The Berent, Goldrun, Hotsprings, Incy, Quincy, Toll, Winchester and Zorravista soils are more than 40 inches deep. Quinton soils have fine sand or loamy fine sand textures in the particle-size control section, a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 56 degrees F and do not have A and Bw horizons. Lachim soils do not have a Bw horizon or a lithic contact at a depth of 24 to 40 inches. Rinquin soils are over semi-consolidated siltstone and the C horizon is fine sand or loamy fine sand that is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Walco soils are over basalt, do not have a paralithic contact and do not have a Bw horizon."
