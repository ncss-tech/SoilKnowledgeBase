The soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from rhyolite, quartzite, and chert. The climate is semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of 12 to 15 inches. The mean annual temperature is 35 to 40 F.; the mean January temperature is 18 to 22 F.; the mean July temperature is 55 to 60 F.; and the frost-free season is 50 to 70 days."
