  "OVERVIEW": "The Platea series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in Wisconsinan age till on till plains and moraines. It is shallow or moderately deep to a fragipan. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high above the fragipan and low to moderately low in the fragipan and the substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1065 mm (42 in), and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",

Dubois and Schaffer soils have thicker sola. The depth to the top of the fragipan in Patricksburg soils is 76 to 102 cm (30 to 40 in) and to a paralithic contact is 152 to 203 cm (60 to 80 in). Wadsworth soils formed in older age till and in slightly different climate characterized by less snow and slightly lower precipitation. Weinbach soils lack an argillic horizon above the fragipan and have mica flakes throughout the solum."

Aquic conditions  beginning at a depth of 10 cm (4 in).\n3. Argillic horizon and fragipan feature - from a depth of 41 to 114 cm (16 to 45 in) (Btx1 and Btx2 horizons).\nDuring the modernization of the Ashtabula County Soil Survey, a pedon located as near as possible to the original typifying pedon was described to 203 cm (80 in) and reviewed at the October, 1993 progress field review. That pedon has been installed as the new series typifying pedon. Reviewers a t the time noted some evidence of translocated clay above the fragipan, after much debate this was deemed to be an argillic horizon. Further review of past documentation and correlation of the Wadsworth series has been recommended to determine whether sufficient differentia exists between the Platea and Wadsworth series."
