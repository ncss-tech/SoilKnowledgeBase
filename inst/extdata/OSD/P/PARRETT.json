The soils are usually moist but are dry for 45 to 75 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches following the summer solstice.  Depth to basalt is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay.  The B horizon has a base saturation (NH4OAc) of 60 to 70 percent.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam with 24 to 35 percent clay.  It has 1 to 5 percent gravel.  It has 1 to 5 percent Fe/Mn concretions. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe AB or BA horizons have hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, chroma of 3 or 4 moist, and 4 to 6 dry.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay, or silty clay with 30 to 45 percent clay.  It has 1 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  It has 1 to 5 percent Fe/Mn concretions.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt or Bw horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, chroma of 3 to 6 moist and 4 to 6 dry.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay, or silty clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  It has 5 to 35 percent paragravel, 0 to 15 percent paracobbles, 1 to 20 percent gravel, and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.

The soils occur at elevations of 250 to 1,600 feet.  The soils formed in colluvium from various members of the Columbia River Basalt Group.  The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F., mean January temperature is 39 to 40 degrees F., and mean July temperature is 65 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 165 to 210 days."

Ritner soils are clayey-skeletal.  Witzel soils are less than 20 inches to a lithic contact.  These soils are on convex positions.  Saum soils are on linear or concave positions."
