  "OVERVIEW": "The Panola series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from calcareous clay beds and thin layers of limestone of Cretaceous\nage.  These soils are on broad nearly level to very gently sloping coastal prairies.  They have a perched water table at a depth of\n0.5 to 1.0 foot late in the fall and early spring.  Water runs off the surface slowly.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.",
