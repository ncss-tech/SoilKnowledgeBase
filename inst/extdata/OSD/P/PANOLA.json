It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam and ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid.  The boundary between the A\nand B horizon is wavy or smooth.\nThe B21t horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1\nor 2.  It has grayish, brownish, or reddish mottles.  The B21t horizon is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay and\nranges from very strongly acid through neutral.\nThe B22t horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6,\nand chroma of 1 through 3.  It has grayish, brownish, or reddish mottles.  It has the same texture and reaction as the B21t\nhorizon.\nThe B23tg or B24tg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma 1 through 4, or it has a mottled reddish, brownish, or grayish matrix.  It ranges from medium acid through mildly alkaline.  Some pedons contain a few fine calcium carbonate nodules.\nThe B3g horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 4 through 6,\nand chroma of 2 through 4, or the matrix is mottled reddish,\nbrownish or grayish.
