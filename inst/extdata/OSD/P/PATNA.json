The lamellae are commonly 1 unit of chroma brighter and contain 1 to 3 percent more clay than the interlamellae eluvial zones. Eluvial zones are sand or coarse sand.\nBC and C horizons\nValue:  4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.\nChroma:  2 or 3, may be 4 in upper part.\nTexture: Sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.\nRock fragments: 0 to 5 percent gravel.\nReaction:  Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSalinity (EC): 0 to 2 mmhos/cm.\nSodicity (SAR): 0 to 5.\nEffervescence Very slightly effervescent or slightly effervescent.\nOther features:  Some pedons have C horizons within 100 cm that have texture of gravelly coarse sand with 25 to 35 percent gravel. Some pedons have texture of silt loam or silty clay loam in contrasting C horizons composed of lacustrine sediments below 100 cm. Some pedons have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Patna soils are on sand sheets and stable dunes on basin-floor remnants.  They formed in eolian sands over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,220 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 175 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 135 days."
