  "OVERVIEW": "The Patna series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sands over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Patna soils are on sand sheets and stable dunes on basin-floor remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
