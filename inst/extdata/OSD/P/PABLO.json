    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a lithic contact is 10 to 20 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 52u to 57\" F. The difference between mean winter and mean summer temperature is 5 to 99 F. The soil moisture control section is moist from mid-November to June. It is dry in some or all parts the rest of the time but is not dry in all parts for 45 consecutive days. Siliceous rock fragments, mostly gravel, make up to 15 percent of the soil. Organic matter is more than 1 percent throughout the solum. The soil is medium acid or slightly acid and commonly becomes more acid with increasing depth. Base saturation is 50 to 75 percent throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon has dry color of IOYR 4/1, 4/2, 5/1 or 5/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 2/1 or 2/2. It is loam or clay loam and has granular or subangular blocky structure. Some horizons have a thin B2 or C horizon between the A horizon and the bedrock."
