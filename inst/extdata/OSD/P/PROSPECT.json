On the steeper slopes the Cca horizon is no more than 10 or 12 inches below the surface. Loam and stony loam types are recognized. Some of the presently nonstony fields have had the large stones removed to facilitate tillage and harvesting operations."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gently undulating to steep kettle and kane topography of lateral and recessional moraines. The Prospect series comprises Chestnut soils developed in light colored, medium textured calcareous glacial till in valleys in the Northern Rocky Mountains. The rocks in the till are quartzites, argillites and dolomitic limestones of the Belt geological formation. Although having a weaker degree of horizonation, the profile of the Prospect series resembles that of the Williams series, Chestnut soils of the glaciated Northern Great Plains, in kind and sequence of horizons and in lacking a textural B horizon, but the Prospect series has a more weakly developed structural B horizon and a greater and more diffused segregation of lime than in the Williams series. Also, the Prospect series is developed in a glacial till of hard rock sources that weather to a high proportion of silt relative to low amounts of sand fractions and clay, whereas in the Williams series the soil separates are more nearly of equal proportion. The Prospect series has lighter colored A and thinner A/B horizons than its Chernozem counterpart, the Yeoman series. The Prospect series is widely distributed throughout the Northern Rocky Mountain region, but is not extensive and is only of local importance in agriculture."
