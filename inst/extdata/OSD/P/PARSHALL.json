    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 45 inches.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 60 inches. A few small pebbles are throughout some pedons with as much as 10 percent below the A horizon.  Some pedons are saline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam, loam or sandy loam.  It is moderately acid to moderately alkaline.  It is moderately alkaline in the dryer part of the range.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, sandy loam or loam.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk and BCk horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  They are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  These horizons are too thin or the accumulation of carbonates too low to qualify as a calcic horizon.  Some pedons have a BC horizon.\nSome pedons have a C horizon.  It has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand or very fine sandy loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have gravelly to clayey 2C horizon below 40 inches.\nSome pedons have one or more Ab horizons.  These are most commonly in areas where the soil formed in glacial outwash or wind modified material."

Bikeyah, Chrishall, Klizhin and Tuntsa soils occur in areas that have elevations of more than 6400 feet.  In addition, Bikeyah and Chrishall soils occur where annual precipitation is more than 20 inches.  Breece soils have a coarse sandy loam particle-size control section and occur at higher elevations.  Dotsero soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Hedoes soils have a lithological discontinuity above a depth of 40 inches that has 30 to 60 percent rock fragments.  Jarmillo soils are noncalcareous throughout.  Ruso soils have stratified sand and gravel above depths of 40 inches."

Slope gradients are commonly less than 4 percent but range from 0 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium.  Mean annual air temperature is 35 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches."
