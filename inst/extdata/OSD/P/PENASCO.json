  "OVERVIEW": "The Penasco series is a member of the loamy, skeletal, carbonatic, mesic, shallow family of Petrocalcic Calciustolls.  Typically, Penasco soils have calcareous dark grayish brown cobbly loam and gravelly loam A horizons and brown gravelly loam Clca horizons over indurated caliche at depth of 12 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the Ccam horizon ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments are limestone and indurated carbonate gravel, cobbles and stones with gravel making up about 30 percent, cobblestones about 10 percent, and stones about 3 percent.  The control section averages more than 40 percent carbonate.  The annual soil temperature ranges from 55 to 58 degrees F.  The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is gravelly loam, cobbly loam or loam with 18 to 27 percent clay and 20 to 40 percent rock fragments.  The C1ca horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is gravelly loam, gravelly clay loam, cobbly loam, cobbly clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and 40 to 60 percent rock fragments.  This horizon is massive or has weak fine subangular blocky structure.  The C2cam horizon ranges from severely fractured, indurated to continuously indurated.  The C3ca horizon ranges from non through strongly cemented gravel and cobblestone carbonate material."

Slopes are dominantly 2 to 9 percent but range to 15 percent.  The soils formed in calcareous, gravelly, cobbly alluvium from limestone.  The climate is semiarid with rainfall of about 16 to 18 inches.  The driest periods occur between late September and May.  The annual temperature is 55 to 57 degrees F."
