A prior revision in March 2001 updated the taxonomic class from Clayey, smectitic, frigid, shallow Aridic Durixerolls and recognized the influence of volcanic ash on the upper horizons.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 11 inches (A1, A2, A3, and Bt and E horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 9 to 19 inches (Bt and E, Bt, and Btq horizons).\nVitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 11 inches (A1, A2, A3, and Bt and E horizons).\nDurinodes - The zone from 15 to 19 inches (Btq horizon).\nDuripan - The zone from 19 to 32 inches (Bqm and Bqkm horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 9 to 19 inches (Bt and E, Bt, and Btq horizons)."
