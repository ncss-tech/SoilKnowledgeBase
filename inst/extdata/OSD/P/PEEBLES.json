  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. Other closely related series are Kewaunee, Ozaukee, Varna, and Winneconne.  Kewaunee and Ozaukee, which are fine, and Winneconne soils, which are very-fine, do not have mollic epipedons. Varna soils have 10YR or yellower hue in the B horizon and the dominant clay mineral is illite in the B and C horizon."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 635 to 890 mm (25 to 35 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.2 to 11.1 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F)."

These soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 31 cm to 91 cm (1.0 to 3.0 feet) for 1 month or more per year in 6 or more out of 10 years."
