  "OVERVIEW": "The Puna series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in organic material mixed with minor amounts of basic volcanic ash in `a`a lava.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 1650 millimeters (65 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 19 degrees C. (66 degrees F.)",

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Puna soils are on mid elevation, leeward slopes of Hualalai and Mauna Loa volcanoes at elevations from 305 to 1067 meters (1000 to 3500 feet).  These soils are on all hillslope components of constructional landscapes consisting of undulating to steep `a`a flows that are 750 to 3,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 40 percent.  The soils formed mainly in organic material consisting of decomposed leaves, twigs, and wood; and to a lesser degree basic volcanic ash, cinders, and weathered lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 1270 to 2030 millimeters (50 to 80 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from April through October.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 640 to 1020 millimeters (25 to 40 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 16 to 22 degrees C. (61 to 71 degrees F.)  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)"
