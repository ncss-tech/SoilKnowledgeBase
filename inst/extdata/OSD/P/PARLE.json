    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 24 inches to 46 inches. Depth to calcium carbonates ranges from 0 to 10 inches. The particle-size control section has 18 to 35 percent noncarbonate clay and contains more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser. The volume of rock fragments within the particle size control section ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Depth to the 2Cg horizon ranges from 46 to greater than 60 inches. Some pedons have gypsum crystals present. Electrical conductivity ranges from 0 to 2 mmhos/cm.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 to 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is clay loam, loam, or silt loam. The reaction typically is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline, but neutral is included in the upper part of some pedons. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the Ap horizon and from 2 to 15 percent in the A horizon. Some pedons have an Ak horizon, but does not qualify for a calcic horizon.\nThe Bkg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It has few to many, faint to prominent redoximorphic features. Texture in the upper part is clay loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. The lower part of the Bkg is fine sandy loam and sandy loam. The reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Secondary lime accumulations range from few to many and the calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 2 to 22 percent.\nSome pedons have a Bg or BCg horizons that do not contain secondary lime accumulations.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. It has few to many, distinct or prominent redoximorphic features. Texture is loamy fine sand or loamy sand. The reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline. Some pedons have a 3Cg horizon with sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam textures below 60 inches. The volume of rock fragments within the 2Cg horizon ranges from 0 to 10 percent."

The well drained Barnes, Buse, Doland, and Egeland soils are on adjacent side slopes and summits. The moderately well drained Svea and Tara soils are on concave foot slopes and flats. The somewhat poorly drained Hamerly soils are on low convex rises. The poorly drained Vallers soils contain more rock fragments and are on similar landscape positions. The poorly drained Colvin soils contain more silt and less sand and are on similar landscape positions. The poorly drained Marysland soils have coarse textured material less than 40 inches from the surface and are on similar landscape positions. The very poorly drained Quam soils are in depressions."
