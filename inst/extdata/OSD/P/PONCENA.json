  "REVDATE": "08/1999",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Poncena series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils on terraces and alluvial fans.  They formed in material that weathered from volcanic rocks and limestone.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.",
