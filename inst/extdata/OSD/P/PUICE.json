  "OVERVIEW": "The Puice series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from interbedded limestone and gypsum rock. Puice soils are on tops and sideslopes of knolls and ridges. Slope ranges from l to l5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about l3 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
