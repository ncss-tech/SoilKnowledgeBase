  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 60 inches or more in thickness.  The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid except the surface layer in limed areas.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4, or hue of 2.5Y, value 6, and chroma of 4.  Some pedons have a thin A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam or loam.\nThe B part of the B/E horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6 with mottles in shades of gray.  The upper 20 inches of the B horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay.  Below 20 inches the texture range includes clay loam.  The E part consists of pockets and tongues with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  These are 1 to 5 inches wide and make up 15 to 40 percent of the volume.  It is silt, silt loam, or silty clay loam with less clay than the B part.\nThe Bt horizon is mottled in shades of brown, gray, and yellow.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, or clay loam.\nThe C horizon, if present, has a grayish matrix with brownish or yellowish mottles, or is mottled in shades of gray, brown, and yellow.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Metcalf is the only series in the same family.  Closely related soils include the Bude, Calloway, Duralde, Falkner, Fred, Frizzell, Leverette, Longview, Messer, and Tippo series.  Metcalf soils do not have tongues of albic materials in the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Bude and Calloway soils have a bisequum and a fragipan.  Duralde soils do not have gray mottles in the upper part of the Bt horizon and the Bt horizon is brittle.  Falkner soils do not have a B/E horizon and have a clayey 2B horizon.  Fred soils have mixed mineralogy and the B and C horizons are alkaline.  Frizzell and Tippo soils have a coarse-silty control section.  Leverett and Messer soils do not have gray mottles in the upper part of the B horizon and are better drained.  Longview soils do not have tongues of albic material in the upper part of the Bt horizon."

The somewhat poorly drained Bude and Falkner soils are in similar positions as the Pooleville soils.  Providence soils, which have a fragipan, and Tippah soils, which do not have tongues of albic material into the argillic horizon and contains more clay in the lower B horizon, are on slightly higher slopes.  Wilcox soils, which are clayey in the control section, are on steeper hillsides and in similar positions as the Pooleville soils."
