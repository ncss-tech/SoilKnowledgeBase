  "OVERVIEW": "The Pooleville series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils with moderately slow permeability.  These soils are in uplands and high terraces of the Southern Coastal Plain and Southern Mississippi Valley Silty Uplands Major Land Resource Areas.  These soils formed in silty sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  A seasonal water table is at 1.5 to 2.5 feet.",

The upper 20 inches of the B horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay.  Below 20 inches the texture range includes clay loam.  The E part consists of pockets and tongues with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  These are 1 to 5 inches wide and make up 15 to 40 percent of the volume.

Closely related soils include the Bude, Calloway, Duralde, Falkner, Fred, Frizzell, Leverette, Longview, Messer, and Tippo series.  Metcalf soils do not have tongues of albic materials in the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Bude and Calloway soils have a bisequum and a fragipan.  Duralde soils do not have gray mottles in the upper part of the Bt horizon and the Bt horizon is brittle.  Falkner soils do not have a B/E horizon and have a clayey 2B horizon.  Fred soils have mixed mineralogy and the B and C horizons are alkaline.  Frizzell and Tippo soils have a coarse-silty control section.  Leverett and Messer soils do not have gray mottles in the upper part of the B horizon and are better drained.  Longview soils do not have tongues of albic material in the upper part of the Bt horizon."
