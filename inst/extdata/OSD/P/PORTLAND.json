  "OVERVIEW": "The Portland series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium from Permian geological formations. These level to nearly level soils are on flood plains and slack water areas along the Arkansas and Red Rivers and their former channels. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is more than 40 inches. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid in the A horizon, except where limed, and ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the Bw1 horizon. The lower Bw and C horizons range from slightly acid through moderately alkaline. Some pedons may be calcareous below depth of 30 inches and contain hard carbonate concretions.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3, 4, or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 4. Iron depletions are in shades of gray and iron accumulations are in shades of brown. Texture is silty clay or clay, but may be silty clay loam or silt loam in areas with thin layers of recent overwash.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 4 and chroma of 3 or 4, or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4. Iron depletions are in shades of gray and iron accumulations are in shades of brown. Texture is commonly clay, but thin subhorizons may be silty clay. The weighted average clay content of the 10-40 inch control section ranges from 60 to 85 percent.\nThe C horizon has colors similar to the Bw. Texture ranges from silt loam to clay. The C horizon is often stratified."

Series in closely related families include Alligator, Gladewater, Harahan, Jacob, Kobel, Leeper, Openlake, Perry, and Sharkey. Alligator soils are in a smectitic mineralogy class and are acid. Gladewater, Kobel, Leeper, and Openlake soils are in a fine particle size class and a smectitic mineralogy class. Harahan, Perry, and Sharkey soils are in a smectitic mineralogy class and are acid. Jacob soils are in a smectitic mineralogy class, are acid, and have a mean soil temperature of less than 59 degrees F."

Hebert and Rilla soils, which occur on low natural levees adjacent to Portland are in a fine-silty particle size class and are more acid in the lower part of the subsoil. McGehee soils, which occur in ridge-swale areas adjacent to Portland soils are in a fine-silty particle size class and are more acid in the lower part of the subsoil. Yorktown soils, which occur in ponded backswamp areas are grayer and do not have vertic properties."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series was reclassified to an Epiaquept (was a Haplaquept) and was assigned to a superactive activity class in 5/2001 based on data from the type location pedon. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of 8 inches.\nCambic horizon - The zone from 8 to 45 inches.\nThe classification of this soil is based on the presence of an aquic moisture regime and because of red parent material that remains red after citrate dithionite extraction."
