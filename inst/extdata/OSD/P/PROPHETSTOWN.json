  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum is 28 to 48 inches in thickness. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 23 inches in thickness. A calcic horizon typically is at the surface, or is within a depth of 16 inches, and has a calcium carbonate equivalent of from 15 to 38 percent. Reaction in the series control section is slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline. Some pedons contain small snail shells in part or all of the solum. In some pedons the depth to the 2Cg horizon is greater than 60 inches. The 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section averages from 18 to 27 percent clay and less than 10 percent sand.\nThe upper 1/4 of the control section (Ap, Apk, A, or ABk horizon) has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 (3 to 5 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe second 1/4 of the control section (Bkg horizon) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 2 or less; and has redoximorphic features with hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 1 to 8.\nThe third 1/4 of the control section (Cg horizon, where present) has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or 10YR; value of 4 to 7; and dominant chroma of 1 or 2; and redoximorphic features have hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 1 to 8. In some pedons there are nearly equal amounts of both low and high chroma.\nThe lower 1/4 of the control section (2Cg horizon), where present, has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2; and has redoximorphic features. It is stratified and dominantly is loamy. Textures are loam, silt loam, sandy loam, loamy sand or sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Prophetstown soils are in depressions or on broad, low summits on outwash plains, till plains, or lake plains. These soils formed in 40 to more than 60 inches of calcareous loess or silty material derived from loess over stratified loamy and sandy material. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 40 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Drummer, Joy, and Waukegan soils. None of these soils have calcic horizons. Drummer soils are on similar low-lying or depressional parts of the outwash plains or till plains. Joy soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on slightly higher parts of the landscape. The Joy soils associated with Prophetstown soils typically have a sandy substratum at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Waukegan soils are well drained, contain sandy outwash within a depth of 20 to 40 inches, and are on higher parts of the landscape."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils previously were included with the Harpster series in mapping. The major interpretive difference between Prophetstown and Harpster soils is shrink-swell potential in the subsoil. Prophetstown soils have low shrink-swell potential while Harpster soils have moderate.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 16 inches (Apk and Ak horizons); calcic horizon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 33 inches (Apk, Ak, Bkg1 and Bkg2 horizons); an aquic soil moisture regime.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data from the University of Illinois pedology laboratory on the typical pedon 83IL-195-210 and on pedon 82IL-195-62, and data from NSSL on pedon S83IL-195-161. Copies of the data are on file in the Illinois state office of NRCS.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
