  "OVERVIEW": "The Picliff series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from siltstone and shale.  Picliff soils are in cuesta valleys.  Slopes range from 3 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
