Added elevation and slope to typical pedon. Changed to tabular format. Added in metric units. Added clay content, sand content, and reaction to RIC. Added latitude, longitude, and datum to type location. Updated MAAT and MAP in geographic setting and added in precipitation pattern and FFD. Updated geographically associated soils by removing Cohoctah and adding Ninnescah, Ralsen, and Suckercreek. Changed permeability to Ksat. Added LRR and MLRA to distribution and extent. Added lab data to additional data.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory data is available for Pedon ID 88KS155015R.\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
