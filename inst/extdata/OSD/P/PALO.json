  "OVERVIEW": "The Palo series consists of soils that are very shallow or shallow to a pertrocalcic horizon.  They are well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale and sandstone.  These soils are on mesa tops and plains.  Slope range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F.",
