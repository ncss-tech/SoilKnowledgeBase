  "OVERVIEW": "The Pyropatti series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from tuff and andesite. Pyropatti soils are on mountains. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
