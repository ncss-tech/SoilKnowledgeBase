  "OVERVIEW": "The Penalosa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium. Penalosa soils are on paleoterraces in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains, MLRA 79. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 740 millimeters (29 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (56 degrees F), at the type location.",
