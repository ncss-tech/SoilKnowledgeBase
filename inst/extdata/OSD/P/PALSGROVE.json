None of the competing soils except Dubuque, Greenridge, Knowles, Lambeau, La Farge and Pepin soils have a lithic or paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Dubuque, Knowles, and La Farge soils have a lithic or paralithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Greenridge and Lambeau soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 203 cm (80 inches).  Pepin soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Palsgrove soils are on convex summits, shoulder slopes, and back slopes of loess-covered bedrock-controlled hill slopes. Slopes typically are 3 to 18 percent but range from 2 to 30 percent. Palsgrove soils formed in 91 to 127 cm (36 to 50 inches) of loess and in clayey residuum weathered from limestone. The mean annual temperature ranges from 6.7 to 9.4 degrees C (44 to 49 degrees F), and the mean annual recipitation ranges from 740 to 1020 mm (29 to 40 inches), frost free days range from 140 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 198 to 412 meters (650 to 1350 feet) above mean sea level."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Palsgrove soils were formerly a part of the Dubuque, deep phase, and that part of Fayette soils that formed in loess thicker than 42 inches but had B horizons continuing into residuum or that had sola resting directly on limestone. This soil is mapped in unglaciated areas and glaciated areas where the glacial drift is very thin and has not contributed significantly to the regolith.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 inches) (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon -- from a depth of 28 to 140 cm (11 to 55 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and 2Bt5 horizons)\nLithic contact at a depth of 140 cm (55 inches) (2R horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Unpublished pedon data for particle size from two pedons are on file in the Illinois\nState Office. They are from Winnebago and Ogle Counties.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
