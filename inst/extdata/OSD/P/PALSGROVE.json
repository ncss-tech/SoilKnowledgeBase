  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Palsgrove soils were formerly a part of the Dubuque, deep phase, and that part of Fayette soils that formed in loess thicker than 42 inches but had B horizons continuing into residuum or that had sola resting directly on limestone. This soil is mapped in unglaciated areas and glaciated areas where the glacial drift is very thin and has not contributed significantly to the regolith.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 inches) (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon -- from a depth of 28 to 140 cm (11 to 55 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and 2Bt5 horizons)\nLithic contact at a depth of 140 cm (55 inches) (2R horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Unpublished pedon data for particle size from two pedons are on file in the Illinois\nState Office. They are from Winnebago and Ogle Counties.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
