    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 degrees to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 59 degrees to 66 degrees F. The soils are usually dry but are moist between depths of 12 and 36 inches in the late winter and early spring months. The upper 10 to 25 inches of the 10 to 40 inch control section are predominantly loamy sand containing less than 15 percent rock fragments. Strongly contrasting layers of silt loam, clay loam or loam are below depths of 20 to 35 inches, but above 40 inches. The depth to the strong Cca or calcic horizon ranges from about 20 to 35 inches. The soils are mildly or moderately alkaline. the horizon has a color value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, chroma of 2 or 3 and organic matter content between 0.25 and 1.5 percent. It has chroma of 2 or 3. The C1 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3.5 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. The C1 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3.5 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. When mixed to a depth of 7 inches, the soil is calcareous to the surface. The IICca horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist.  A subhorizon of the Cca at least 6 inches thick has its upper boundary above 40 inches and contains 15 to 25 percent calcium carbonate."

Declo soils are dominantly medium textured in the control section and Malm, Matheson, and Stan soils are dominantly moderately coarse textured.  Malm soils have basalt bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Feltham soils have a mean annual soil temperature warmer than 47 degrees F. and lack a calcic horizon. Sasser, Stan, and Wapello soils have mollic epipedons. Sasser soils have moderately coarse textures over loose gravel and sand. Wapello soils have moderately coarse textures over the silt loam and lack a calcic horizon. Wolverine soils have no texture of loamy very fine sand or finer in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  The soils are on level to very gently sloping terraces at elevations of 4,200 to 5,500 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  The soils formed mainly in loamy sand over medium textured lake deposits or alluvium. The parent material is dominantly from quartzite and sedimentary rock sources, but contains some rhyolitic, basaltic, and granitic materials. In some pedons, the upper part may be eolian deposits. The climate is semiarid with dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches including 1 to 3 feet of snowfall.  Average freeze-free period is 94 to 126 days."
