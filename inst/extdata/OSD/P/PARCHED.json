Baboquivari soils formed in alluvium and are noneffervescent throughout. Canez soils formed in alluvium and receive more than half of the precipitation between late May and early September. Courtland soils formed in alluvium, are deeper than 25 centimeters to the top of the argillic horizon and have color hues of 2.5YR or 5YR throughout the argillic horizon. Triomas soils formed in eolian materials and have hues of 5YR or redder within the argillic horizon. Walkon soils have a lithic contact between 50 and 100 centimeters (20 and 40 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Parched soils are on side slopes of hills. Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from andesite. Elevations are 1345 to 1785 meters (4412 to 5855 feet). The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, intermittently moist summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to the Sonoran Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 175 to 225 millimeters (7 to 9 inches). The mean annual air temperature is 13 to 17 degrees C (55 to 63 degrees F). The frost-free season is 210 to 270 days."

Lecyr have a petrocalcic horizon at 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches). Ustidur soils have a duripan at 10 to 36 centimeters (4 to 14 inches)."
