  "OVERVIEW": "The Parched series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from andesite. Parched soils are on side slopes of hills. Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 millimeters (8 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",

Baboquivari soils formed in alluvium and are noneffervescent throughout. Canez soils formed in alluvium and receive more than half of the precipitation between late May and early September. Courtland soils formed in alluvium, are deeper than 25 centimeters to the top of the argillic horizon and have color hues of 2.5YR or 5YR throughout the argillic horizon. Triomas soils formed in eolian materials and have hues of 5YR or redder within the argillic horizon. Walkon soils have a lithic contact between 50 and 100 centimeters (20 and 40 inches)."
