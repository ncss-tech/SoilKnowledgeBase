  "REVDATE": "02/2007",
  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pompeii series consists of shallow and very shallow over a strongly cemented petrocalcic, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium from basalt.  Pompeii soils are on fan terraces and hills.  Slopes are 3 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees.",
