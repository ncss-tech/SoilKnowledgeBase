  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 35 to 60 inches.  Total thickness of the sandy layers, or depth to the Btkg horizon, is 20 to 40 inches.  Soil reaction in these sandy layers ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline.  The remainder of the profile is mildly or moderately alkaline and calcareous.  Depth to secondary carbonate accumulations ranges from 10 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or fine sand.  Where value is 2 or 3 and chroma of 1, thickness is less than 7 inches.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bk horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Accumulations of secondary carbonates occur as coatings on sand grains, in interstices between sand grains, and/or as root casts. Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Btkg horizon has hue of 10YR or 5GY, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2, with or without mottles of gray, brown, yellow, or red.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY or is, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or a mixture of these.  In some pedons, some of the sand grains are pieces of shell."

Boca soils have limestone bedrock between 20 to 40 inches.  Felda, Pinellas, and Roemer soils do not have high chroma Bw horizons, and Felda in addition does not have Bk horizons.  Isles soils have limestone bedrock between 40 and 60 inches.  Ellzey and Heights are in sandy families.  Malabar soils do not have Bk horizons and have sandy surfaces 40 and 60 inches thick.  Panasoffkee soils are in a clayey family.  Pineda soils are noncalcareous, and they have tongues or intrusions of albic materials into the Bt horizon."
