  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pileup soils are on mountain side slopes at elevations of 3000 to 5,400 feet. Slopes are 10 to 55 percent. These soils formed in colluvium from basalt or andesite with a mantle of volcanic ash. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches. The average January temperature is about 24 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 62 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is about 41 to 43 degrees. The frost-free season is 40 to 80 days and the growing season at 28 degrees F. is 130 to 170 days."
