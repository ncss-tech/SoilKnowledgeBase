  "OVERVIEW": "The Preussrange series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum from calcareous siltstone on mountains.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Preussrange soils have slopes of 12 to 70 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 21 inches.  Average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
