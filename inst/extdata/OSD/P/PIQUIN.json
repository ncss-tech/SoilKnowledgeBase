  "OVERVIEW": "The Piquin series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous sources.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on relict terraces.   Slope ranges from 5 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
