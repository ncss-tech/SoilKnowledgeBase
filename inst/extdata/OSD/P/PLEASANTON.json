Burchell and Modesto soils are somewhat poorly drained and are mottled in the lower horizons.  Coarsegold, Perkins and Rescue soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the Bt horizon.  Jacinto soils have hue of 2.5Y.  Sobrante soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Trimmer and Whitney soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Zamora soils are fine-silty."
