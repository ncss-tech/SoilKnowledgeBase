These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from weakly consolidated conglomerate. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1000 to 2160 millimeters. Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C, and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 300 days."
