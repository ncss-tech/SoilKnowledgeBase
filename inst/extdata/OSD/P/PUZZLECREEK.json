The soil is formed in colluvial material derived from basalt mixed with volcanic ash and loess in the surface. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 32 to 41 degrees F. The frost-free period is 45 to 70 days."
