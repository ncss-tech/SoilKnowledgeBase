  "OVERVIEW": "The Puzzlecreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on back slopes of mountains. Puzzlecreek soils are formed in colluvial material derived from basalt mixed with volcanic ash and loess in the surface. Slopes are 15 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F.",
