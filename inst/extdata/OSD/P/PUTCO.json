Reaction in the A horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline and the C horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5 and chroma of 1 to 6 or is neutral.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10R to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 6 or is neutral.  It is silty clay or clay."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gorin, Keswick, Vanmeter and Winnegan series.  Gorin, Keswick and Winnegan soils do not have soft fragments of shale in the profile.  Gorin soils are upslope on narrow ridgetops and formed in loess and pedisediment.  Keswick soils are upslope on narrow ridgetops, interfluves, and sideslopes and formed mostly in glacial till.  Winnegan soils are on higher slopes and formed in glacial till.  Vanmeter soils are commonly upslope, formed in residuum from calcareous shale and have a Cr horizon at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."

These soils were formerly mapped as mine spoils.  Soil colors with value of 2 or 3 result from finely divided coal or black shale and do not result from genetic soil development.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
