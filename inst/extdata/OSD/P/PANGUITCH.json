    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick and is more than one-third the depth to the calcic horizon.  Depth to the Bk horizon ranges from 18 to 30 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 13 to 18 percent clay and 20 to 35 percent rock fragments.  These soils have a mean annual soil temperature of about 44 to 47 degrees F. and a mean summer soil temperature of about 59 to 64 degrees F.  They are noncalcareous in the A horizon and very strongly calcareous in the Bk horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Dry value of the A horizon is less than 4.5 after the upper 7 inches are mixed.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It ranges from gravelly sandy loam to gravelly and cobbly clay loam.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 to 8 dry, 5 to 7 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It ranges from gravelly and very gravelly loamy sand to gravelly and very gravelly loam."
