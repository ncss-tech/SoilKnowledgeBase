  "OVERVIEW": "The Petty series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over material derived mainly from granite and gneiss. Petty soils are on mountain slopes and broad ridgetops. Slopes are 8 to 80 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

Petty soils have a cryic temperature regime and a udic moisture regime.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Andic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Andic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified."
