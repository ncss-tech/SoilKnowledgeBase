When dry the soil has a strong granular surface mulch that ranges from 1/2 to 2 inches in thickness, and cracks 1/2 to 2 inches wide and several feet deep.  Mean annual soil temperature is about 72 degrees F.  The soil is dry in some horizons for more than 90 cumulative days in most years.  The solum is clay or silty clay.  It has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist.\nThe B horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 either moist or dry."
