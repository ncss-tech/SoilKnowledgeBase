Balon soils are noneffervescent throughout.  Blancot and Yenlo soils have hue of 10YR and 2.5Y.  Bowbac, Cambria, Cushman, Delconey, Forkwood, Hiland, Pokeman, Potts, Pugsley, Spangler and Teckla soils are moist in May and June.  Buckle, Oelop and Palacid soils contain less than 40 percent sand.  Doakum soils average less than 1 percent organic matter in the upper 16 inches.  Quagwa soils contain less than 25 percent sand.  Cerropelon, Cumacho, Gaddes, Gapbutte, Gapmesa, Hagerman, and Hagerwest soils have bedrock at moderate depths.  Chilerojo, Fort, Olney, Sundance and Tamarindo soils attempt to reflect the effects of soil forming agents unique to the Great Plains.  Redpen soils have 2.5YR hue.  Mentmore soils have 2.5Y hue.  Chilojo soils are inactive."

They formed in alluvium, fan alluvium, slope alluvium and eolian material derived principally from sandstone and shale. Elevations range from 4,800 to 7,100 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches. Mean annual air temperature is 49 to 57 degrees F. The frost-free period is 115 to 180 days."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizons: The zone from 2 to 22 inches (Bt horizons)\nThe type location of the Penistaja series was moved from Sandoval County to Cibola County in 1983 to better reflect the present concept of the Penistaja series.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006\nThe Penistaja and Doakum series were originally classified in Ustollic and Ustalfic subgroups, respectively.  A later revision to Soil Taxonomy combined these into one Ustic subgroup resulting in duplication of series differentia and inconsistent field mapping. Surface organic matter content has been better defined as differentia but the Doakum series may need to be inactivated if concept confusion persists after 7/2007\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
