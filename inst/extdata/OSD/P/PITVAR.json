  "OVERVIEW": "The Pitvar series consists of deep to hardpan, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium from extrusive igneous rock.  Pitvar soils are in basins and in drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
