    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 67 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 77 to 82 degrees F.  The soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section 75 to 85 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  The C horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is loamy fine sand, fine sand, or loamy sand and in some places is sandy loam below depths of 40 inches.  In the 10 to 40 inch section, silt and clay content is less than 10 percent and gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  The C1 horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline and the C2 horizon is mildly to strongly alkaline.  Carbonates in the lower part of the C horizon range from noncalcareous to moderately calcareous."

Berent, Mespun, and Sheppard soils have mesic Temperature.  Bluepoint, Brazito, Maynard Lake, Moapa, and Toquop soils are calcareous throughout the profile.  Brazito, Cajon, Maynard Lake, and Herra soils have dominant hue of 10YR.  Yturbide soils have gravelly control sections.  Kermit soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Toquerville soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to a lithic contact."

The soil formed in deposits of wind-blown sand weathered from sandstone.  Much of the area has recent deposits of wind-blown sand weathered from sandstone.  Much of the area has recent deposits of wind-drifted sand in a fine pattern of hummocks ranging from 10 to 36 inches in height. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 11 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 65 degrees F.  Freeze-free period is about 190 to 195 days."
