  "OVERVIEW": "The Pillot series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy sand or sandy deposits. These soils are on loess covered sandy outwash plains, wind-blown sandy hummocks, or treads and risers on stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 89 centimeters (35 inches).",
