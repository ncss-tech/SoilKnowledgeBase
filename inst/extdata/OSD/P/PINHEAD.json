    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist and are not dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for as long as 45 consecutive days in the four months that follow the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 36 to 40 degrees F.  Depth to andesite bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR. The particle-size control section has 45 to 80 percent rock fragments and 10 to 15 percent clay.  Phosphate retention is more than 85 percent and acid oxalate aluminum plus 1/2 iron is between 2 and 5 percent in the less than 2.0 mm fraction.  There is 25 to 40 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregate in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction.  The 15-bar water is 15 to 20 percent on air dried samples and less than 30 percent on undried samples.  The moist bulk density is 0.80 to 0.90g/cc.  It is moderately to strongly acid.  Acid oxalate extractable silica is 0.7 to 2.0 percent throughout the zone having andic soil properties.\nThe A and AB horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly ashy sandy loam, very stony ashy sandy loam, or very bouldery ashy sandy loam and has 5 to 55 percent gravel, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, 0 to 30 percent stones, and 0 to 30 percent boulders.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  Rock fragments range from 45 to 80 percent of which 30 to 50 percent are gravel and 15 to 30 percent are cobbles.\nThe BC horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is medial loamy sand or medial sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 60 to 85 percent of which 30 to 40 percent are gravel, 20 to 30 percent are cobbles and 10 to 15 percent are stones."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pinhead soils are on nearly level to very steep side slopes of mountains.  Elevations range from 3400 to 6400 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The soil formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from andesite with an influence of volcanic ash.  The climate is characterized by cold and wet winters and cool and moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 110 inches. The mean annual temperature is 34 to 38 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 10 to 45 days."
