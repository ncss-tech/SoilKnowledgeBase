  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to bedrock is 5 to 10 inches.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Textures through the pedon are silt loam, fine sandy loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or the gravelly or cobbly analogs of these textures.  Gravel content ranges from 5 to 15 percent by volume and cobble content ranges from 0 to 20 percent. Rock fragments are dominantly limestone but also include granites.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.  Some areas have thin organic layers on the surface.  Some pedons have a thin Bw horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 to 6."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ansari, Corpening, Falcon, Kloten and Namur soils in the same family and the Ensign, Romeo and Ruse series.  The Ansari, Corpening, Falcon, Kloten and Namur soils do not have mottles in their profiles and are well drained.  In addition Ansari soils have redder hue, are underlain by sandstone and have a consistent k horizon.  Corpening and Falcon soils are usually dry.  Kloten soils have grayer hue and have formed in shale.  Ensign and Ruse soils are underlain by bedrock at depths of 10 to 20 inches.  In addition Ruse soils are poorly drained.  Romeo soils are mesic."

The somewhat poorly drained Ensign soils are on similar landscape positions, and the poorly drained Ruse soils are in depressions or drainageways.  The well drained Summerville soils are on higher landscape positions."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Classification of loamy, mixed Lithic Haploborolls is justified based on the lack of a histic epipedon, mottling in the mollic epipedon, or gray colors immediately below the mollic epipedon. Also, the natural vegetation of the area indicates more of the somewhat poorly drained soil condition rather than a poorly drained (aquic) condition.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 7 inches (after mixing); a lithic contact at 7 inches (2R).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
