  "OVERVIEW": "The Potato series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from rhyolite. Potato soils are on sideslopes of lava domes. Slopes range from 2 to 36 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
