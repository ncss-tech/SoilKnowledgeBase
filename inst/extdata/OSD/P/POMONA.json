  "OVERVIEW": "The Pomona series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments. Pomona soils are on flats and flatwoods on marine terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C (72 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 1397 millimeters (55 inches).",
