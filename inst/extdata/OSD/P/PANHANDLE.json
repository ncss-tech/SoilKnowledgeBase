The climate is characterized by warm, moist summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 130 to 140 inches including considerable snowfall.  Average January temperature is 25 degrees F; average July temperature is 59 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is 38 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 70 to 90 days."
