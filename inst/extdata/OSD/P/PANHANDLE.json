Panhandle soils formed in cindery pyroclastic flow material from the May 18, 1980 and subsequent eruptions of Mt. St. Helens.  The climate is characterized by warm, moist summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 130 to 140 inches including considerable snowfall.  Average January temperature is 25 degrees F; average July temperature is 59 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is 38 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 70 to 90 days."
