  "OVERVIEW": "The Powwatka series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in loess with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  They are on rolling hills and ridgetops.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist, but are dry in the 4 to 12 inch control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days.  The mollic epipedon is 12 to 20 inches thick and may include the upper part of the Bt horizon.  The particle-size control section has more than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Depth to basalt bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5  dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is ashy silt loam or cobbly ashy silt loam with 18 to 25 percent clay.  It has 0 to 30 percent cobbles and 0 to 15 percent gravel.  It has 30 to 60 percent volcanic glass and glass coated aggregate and less than 0.1 percent acid oxalate oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron.  Soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR  or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silt clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  The Bt2 horizon has 0 to 10 percent gravel.  Soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral in the upper part and neutral or slightly alkaline in the lower part."
