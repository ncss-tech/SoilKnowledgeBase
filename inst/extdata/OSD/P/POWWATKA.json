    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist, but are dry in the 4 to 12 inch control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days.  The mollic epipedon is 12 to 20 inches thick and may include the upper part of the Bt horizon.  The particle-size control section has more than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Depth to basalt bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5  dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is ashy silt loam or cobbly ashy silt loam with 18 to 25 percent clay.  It has 0 to 30 percent cobbles and 0 to 15 percent gravel.  It has 30 to 60 percent volcanic glass and glass coated aggregate and less than 0.1 percent acid oxalate oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron.  Soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR  or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silt clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  The Bt2 horizon has 0 to 10 percent gravel.  Soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral in the upper part and neutral or slightly alkaline in the lower part."

Elevation is 3,400 to 5,200 feet.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 17 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 100 days."

Harlow soils are clayey-skeletal, less than 20 inches to bedrock and occur on south-facing side slopes.  Hurwal soils occur in drainageways and on footslopes of north-facing side slopes.  Parsnip soils are 10 to 20 inches to bedrock and occur on adjacent plateaus.  Snell soils are clayey-skeletal, 20 to 40 inches to bedrock, and occur on north-facing side slopes."
