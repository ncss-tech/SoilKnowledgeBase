    "content": "REMARKS: Penhook soils were formerly recognized in the Georgeville series. The 4/97 relocation of the mesic/thermic line in North Carolina and Virginia dictated the need for the Penhook series as a mesic counterpart. The soil horizon depths were revised on 10/2021 to ensure the description began at the soil surface.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon-the zone from 0 to 7 inches (O and A horizons)\nArgillic horizon-the zone from 7 to 44 inches (Bt horizons)\nSeries control section-0 to 60 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA: This pedon sampled as S98VA067-006.
