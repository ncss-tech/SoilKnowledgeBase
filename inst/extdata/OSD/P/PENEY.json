  "OVERVIEW": "The Peney series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from limestone.  Peney soils are on summits of hills and have slopes of 3 to 20 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",
