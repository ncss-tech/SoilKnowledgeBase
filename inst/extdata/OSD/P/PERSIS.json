  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Persis soils are on stream terraces above the normal flood plain.  These soils are confined to the major stream valleys on the west slope of the northcentral Cascade Mountains.  Persis soils formed in volcanic ash and alluvium overlying sandy deltaic deposits associated with proglacial lakes.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,000 to 1,600 feet.  The climate is marine influenced, with relatively cool, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 80 to 120 inches, which occurs mainly as rainfall between October and March.  The mean January temperature is about 31 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 169 to 180 days."

Snoqualmie soils lack a spodic horizon and are sandy-skeletal."
