  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinellas series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very rapid to rapidly permeable soils on flats that border sloughs and depressions.  They formed in sandy marine sediments over loamy sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Reaction of the A and E horizon ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.  The Bk horizon is calcareous.  The Btg and C horizons range from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 6.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 3; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, and gray range from none to common.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Accumulations of calcium carbonate occur as coatings on sand grains, in the interstices between sand grains, are more than 6 inches thick, have more than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, and are more than 5 percent higher than the underlying horizons.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 7.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, olive, or gray range from none to common.  In some pedons, this horizon has accumulations of calcium carbonate in root channels but calcium carbonate equivalent is less than 5 percent.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, occurs over layers of shell fragments in some pedons.  They have the same range of colors as the Btg horizon.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe 2C horizon, where present, is a mixture of sand and shell fragments in varying proportions.  Color is largely dependent on color of the shell, but the sand has color similar to the Btg horizon.  Texture is the gravelly to extremely gravelly analogs of sand or fine sand."

The poorly and very poorly drained Basinger and Valkaria soils are on similar to lower positions, are sandy throughout, and have weakly expressed spodic horizons.  Bradenton soils are on higher and lower positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers less than 20 inches in thickness.  The poorly and very poorly drained Holopaw soils are on similar positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches thick.  The very poorly and poorly drained Oldsmar and Wabasso soils are Spodosols.  In addition, Oldsmar soils are on similar positions while Wabasso soils are on similar to lower positions and have argillic horizons less than 37 inches from the surface.  Parkwood soils are on similar positions and have mollic epipedon.  Pineda and Riviera soils have E horizons that tongue into the argillic horizon.

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 18 inches (A and E horizons)\nAlbic horizon - the zone from 3 to 18 inches (E1 and E2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 35 and 54 inches (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons).\nPinellas soils were formerly mapped in the Keri series as a loamy substratum phase.  This concept limits the series to those soils that have calcareous E horizons over a Btg horizon.\nThe water table is within depths of 12 inches for less than 3 months and is 12 to 40 inches deep for 2 to 6 months during most years.  It may recede to depths of more than 40 inches during extended dry seasons."
