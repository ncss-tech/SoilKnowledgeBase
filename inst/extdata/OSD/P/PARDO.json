These soils formed in residuum weathered from Mitchell Mesa Ignimbrite (welded tuff).  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 20 inches, with most occurring from July through September.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 70 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 180 to 240, and elevation ranges from 4,000 to 6,995 feet."
