  "OVERVIEW": "The Pardo series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon and hard bedrock.  They are well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum derived from Mitchell Mesa Ignimbrite (welded tuff).  These soils are on gently undulating to undulating summits and crests of bedrock-capped mesas.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.",
