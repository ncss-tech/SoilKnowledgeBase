  "OVERVIEW": "The Poudre series consists of very deep, poorly or somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium derived mainly from micaceous schist and gneiss.  Poudre soils are on terraces, floodplains, and in drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 355 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
