  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 10 inches.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent and conductivity ranges from 0 to 14 millimhos in a major part of the control section and no subhorizons more than 3 inches thick above a depth of 20 inches exceed these limits.  Continuous concentrated horizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate do not occur within the control section. The mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to 50 inches thick.  The control section is usually sandy loam, but average 5 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 40 percent silt, and 45 to 80 percent sand, with more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand and excluding textures of loamy fine sand or coarser.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in a major part of the control section and are mainly 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter.  The major part of the control section has hue of 7.5YR or yellower but a few subhorizons having hue redder than 7.5YR occur discontinuously in some pedons and occupy less than 1/2 the thickness of the control section.  Sand and silt fractions contain 2 to 20 percent or more mica platelets of sufficient size to affect the physical properties of the soil.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It has few small distinct to many large prominent mottles.  This horizon ranges from mildly to strongly alkaline (l:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nThe B2g horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  Subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline (l:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).  Calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth ranges from less than 1 to about 4 percent."

Dobrow soils have mean summer soil temperature colder than 55 degrees F., are noncalcareous, and overlie noncontrasting sand and gravel IIC horizons.  Loveland soils have a mollic epipedon less than 24 inches thick, have medium or moderately fine textured upper control sections, and overlie contrasting sand and gravel IIC horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Poudre soils are on terraces, floodplains, and drainageways.  Slopes typically range from about 0 to 6 percent or more.   The soils formed in thick calcareous micaceous moderately coarse textured alluvium derived principally from micaceous schist and gneiss.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual temperature is 47 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 67 degrees F."
