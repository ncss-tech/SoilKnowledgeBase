The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  The soils are slightly acid to neutral.  The solum is 7 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The control section lacks rock fragments.  It has greater than 85 percent phosphate retention, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 2 to 3 percent, and 9 to 12 percent 15-bar moisture based on an air-dried sample. The umbric epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 5 to 30 percent 1 to 5 mm diameter nodules.\nThe Bw has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist and 5 through 7 dry.  It is loam or silt loam and has 4 to 10 percent clay.  It has 5 to 30 percent 1 to 5 mm diameter nodules.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry."
