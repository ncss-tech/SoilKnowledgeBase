  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the base of the cambic horizon is 20 to 45 inches. The particle-size control section averages between 18 to 25 percent clay and range from 10 to 30 percent rock fragments. The rock fragments are dominantly as channers of sandstone, and include pebbles.\nThe upper part of the control section (Ap or A) has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4 and is silt loam. Rock fragments range from 5 to 14 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe second part of the control section (Bw) has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loam or channery loam.  It has 8 to 30 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe lower part of the control section (C) has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is channery or very channery analogues of loam or sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 30 percent in the upper part and range to 60 percent in the lower part.   Reaction is moderately acid to neutral."

The mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 56  degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 44 inches."

The well drained, moderately deep Berks soils are on backslopes.   The well drained, more silty Cuba and Hammond soils are on slightly higher lying floodplain steps.  The well drained, moderately deep Gilpin soils, and the well drained, deep Wellston soils are on summits, shoulders and backslopes."

This classification is based on the estimated soil properties and may change as characterization data becomes available.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in\nthis pedon are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 6 inches (Ap horizon);  cambic horizon - the zone from 6 to 26 inches (Bw1, Bw2, and Bw3 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
