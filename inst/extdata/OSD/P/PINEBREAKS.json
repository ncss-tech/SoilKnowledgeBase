    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Pinebreaks soils are on steep north facing slopes and in narrow north facing ravines on uplands. Elevations are 1,900 to 4,000 feet.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Pinebreaks soils formed in material derived from consolidated shale.  The climate is cool, with moist springs and hot dry summers and long cold winters. Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 135 days."
