  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinebreaks series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material derived from consolidated acid shale.  These soils are on uplands.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
