  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pepperwood soils are on linear to slightly convex positions on flood-plain steps in mountain river valleys. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations are 18 to 170 meters. These soils formed in alluvium from mixed sedimentary sources. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 1780 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C. Frost free season is about 280 to 350 days."

Cottoneva and Eelriver soils occur under native redwood forest where the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is less than 6 degrees C. Eelriver and Shivelyflat soils have less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. Eelriver and Shivelyflat soils occur on linear to slightly concave positions on floodplain steps and natural levees. Cottoneva soils occur on the same positions as Pepperwood soils."
