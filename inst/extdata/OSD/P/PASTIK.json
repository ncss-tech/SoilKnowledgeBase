These soils formed in lacustrine sediments and volcanic ash.  The climate is characterized by mild, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  The annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 70 inches.  The average January temperature is 33 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 59 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 46 degrees F.  The frost free season is 140 to 200 days."
