    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly to neutral in the Ap and BA horizons,very strongly acid to medium acid in the Bt horizon, and is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the 2Bt horizon.  Rock fragments are mostly gravel size chert and range from 0 to about 5 percent in the Ap, BA, and Bt horizons, and from 0 to 35 percent in the 2Bt horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silt loam.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 to 8.  Mottles are in shades of brown yellow, or red.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay, or the gravelly modifier."

All of the geographically associated soils are on similar landscape positions as the Pricetown soils.  Caneyville soils are moderately deep and have a base saturation greater than 35 percent immediately above the lithic contact.  Christian and Frederick soils are in clayey families, and have mixed mineralogy.  Sango and Teddy soils have fragipans.  Sango soils are in the thermic temperature regime.  Garmon soils lack an argillic horizon, are moderately deep, and are in a fine-loamy family.  Lonewood soils have less clay in the lower solum, are in a fine-loamy family, and lack a lithologic discontinuity."
