  "OVERVIEW": "The Pricetown series consists of deep, well drained moderately permeable soils that formed in a silty mantle over residuum from cherty limestone.  These soils are on nearly level to sloping uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 51 inches.",

Caneyville soils are moderately deep and have a base saturation greater than 35 percent immediately above the lithic contact.  Christian and Frederick soils are in clayey families, and have mixed mineralogy.  Sango and Teddy soils have fragipans.  Sango soils are in the thermic temperature regime.  Garmon soils lack an argillic horizon, are moderately deep, and are in a fine-loamy family.  Lonewood soils have less clay in the lower solum, are in a fine-loamy family, and lack a lithologic discontinuity."
