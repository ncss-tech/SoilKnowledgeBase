  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the loamy mantle and depth to gravelly loamy sand or coarser textures ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The depth to free carbonates is more than 80 inches. Rock fragment content ranges from 3 to 25 percent in the mantle and 15 to 65 percent in the underlying sediment.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 15 percent with 3 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 7 percent cobbles and 0 to 3 percent stones and boulders. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have thin E horizons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 4 through 6. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or their gravelly analogues. Rock fragment content ranges from 3 to 25 percent with 3 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 7 percent cobbles and 0 to 3 percent stones and boulders. Fe depletions and concentrations are in the lower part of the Bw horizon. The reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a BC or a 2BC horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 4 through 6. Some pedons have hue of 10YR, value of 3 and chroma of 2 in some Rainy lobe materials. It is very gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly coarse sand, very gravelly sand or their gravelly analogues. Rock fragment content ranges from 15 to 65 percent. The gravel content typically ranges from 15 to 65 percent but subhorizons may range from 5 to 75 percent. Cobbles range from 0 to 10 percent and the stone and boulder content ranges from 0 to 3 percent. It is moderately or slightly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pequaywan soils have linear to concave slopes on outwash plains, moraines, drumlins and eskers. They formed in a loamy mantle overlying acid gravelly outwash. The material is from the Rainy Lobe, Superior Lobe or mixed from both sources and is of the Late Wisconsinan glaciation. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 42 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 30 inches. Annual frost free days range from 90 to 120 days. The elevation above sea level ranges from 1,150 to 1,650 feet."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon); cambic horizon - the zone from 2 to 30 inches (Bw horizons), Dystric subgroup based on no free carbonates above 40 inches. The nature of this reddish colored parent material masks redoximorphic features in the lower part of this soil profile. A positive reaction with alpha alpha dipyridyl is presumed at some time during the year in most years. Isotic minerology is based upon the 15 Bar moisture/clay ratio of greater than .6 in the control section.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil interpretation Record number MN0762.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
