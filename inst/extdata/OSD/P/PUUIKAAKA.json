These soils are in depressions of constructional landscapes consisting of nearly level to moderately steep pahoehoe flows that are less than 5,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over pahoehoe lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 380 to 760 millimeters (15 to 30 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from January through July.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1520 to 1780 millimeters (60 to 70 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 17 to 21 degrees C (63 to 70 degrees F).  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
