Argillic horizon: from a depth of 25 to 76 cm (10 to 30 inches) (B part of B/E, Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\n3. Glossic horizon: from a depth of 18 to 38 cm (7 to 15 inches) (E/B and B/E horizons).\nThese soils were formerly mapped as dual drainage class (moderately well and well drained) until the Onekama series was established as the well drained component of the catena in 2005.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
