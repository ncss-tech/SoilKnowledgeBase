The solum (A and Bw horizons) is 10 to 14 inches thick, has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.00 to 1.25 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 20 to 50 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The depth to the 2Cd horizon is 30 to 45 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 65 percent rock fragments and 1 to 6 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has values of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has values of 3 or 4 moist and chromas of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  It is gravelly ashy sandy loam, ashy sandy loam, or stony ashy sandy loam.

These soils formed in granitic glacial till and some glacial outwash with a mantle of volcanic ash in the upper part.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers, and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 18 to 24 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 22 to 26 degrees F, the average July temperature ranges from 62 to 67 degrees F, and the average annual air temperature ranges from is 39 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 85 to 125 days."
