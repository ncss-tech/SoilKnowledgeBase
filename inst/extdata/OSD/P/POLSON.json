Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in silty glacial and lacustrine deposits.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs and falls; and warm, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 105 to 135 days."

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (Ap horizon); a transitional thin albic horizon from 7 to 10 inches (E/Btn horizon); natric horizons from 10 to 26 inches (Btn, Bkn1, Bkn2, and part of BCn horizons); and a fine-silty particle-size control section from 10 to 15 inches (Btn horizon).  Polson soils have a frigid temperature regime and a xeric moisture regime.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory samples S84MT-047-000.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
