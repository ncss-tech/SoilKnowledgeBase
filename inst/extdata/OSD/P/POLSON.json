  "OVERVIEW": "The Polson series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in silty glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces on glaciated uplands and dissected lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
