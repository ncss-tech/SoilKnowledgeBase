  "OVERVIEW": "The Pewamo series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in till on moraines, near-shore zones (relict), and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).",

An overwash phase is recognized.\nA dense substratum phase is currently recognized in MLRA. Further evaluation is needed to determine the presence of densic material in other MLRAs where this series occurs.\n06/2016 revision: added wetland veg data from Indiana.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Record: MI0042, MI0518. Soil characterization data is available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE.\nIn Indiana, the native vegetative cover is a forested wetland community commonly inhabited with Green Ash, Pin Oak, Silver Maple, Black Willow, Northern Spicebush, American Elm, Eastern Cottonwood, Ohio Buckeye, Reed Canary Grass, Yellow Nutsedge, Cattail Sedge, Softstem Bulrush and Swamp Milkweed.
