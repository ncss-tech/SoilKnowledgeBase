Native vegetation is forest of red maple, American elm, white ash, and American basswood. See Additional Data section for native vegetative cover in Indiana."

An overwash phase is recognized.\nA dense substratum phase is currently recognized in MLRA. Further evaluation is needed to determine the presence of densic material in other MLRAs where this series occurs.\n06/2016 revision: added wetland veg data from Indiana.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Record: MI0042, MI0518. Soil characterization data is available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE.\nIn Indiana, the native vegetative cover is a forested wetland community commonly inhabited with Green Ash, Pin Oak, Silver Maple, Black Willow, Northern Spicebush, American Elm, Eastern Cottonwood, Ohio Buckeye, Reed Canary Grass, Yellow Nutsedge, Cattail Sedge, Softstem Bulrush and Swamp Milkweed.
