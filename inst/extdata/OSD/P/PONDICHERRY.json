  "OVERVIEW": "The Pondicherry series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in organic accumulations that are underlain by stratified sand and gravel.  They are in bogs and swamps on outwash plains, lake plains, and till uplands. Estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the organic horizons, and high to very high in the mineral substratum.  Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the organic horizons, and rapid or very rapid in the mineral substratum.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the organic soil layers ranges from 16 to 51 inches.  The organic materials consist mainly of highly decomposed herbaceous materials.  Slightly decomposed woody fragments comprise 0 to 15 percent by volume of the organic materials.  Reaction in H2O ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the organic and mineral layers.\nThe surface tier has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse granular, or it is massive.  Consistence is nonsticky or slightly sticky and nonplastic. It is dominantly sapric material with unrubbed fiber content of 10 to 95 percent and rubbed fiber content of 5 to 15 percent.  Some pedons have thin hemic or fibric layers at or near the surface with chroma 3.\nThe subsurface tier and bottom tier, where present, have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Structure is weak, fine to coarse granular or subangular blocky, or it is massive.  Consistence is nonsticky  or slightly sticky and nonplastic.  It is sapric material with unrubbed fiber content of 10 to 95 percent and rubbed fiber content of 5 to 15 percent.\nThe Cg or C horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5BG, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 3. Some layers have hue of 7.5YR due to organic influence.  Texture is coarse sand, sand, fine sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  Mucky texture modifier is applicable in some layers. Rock fragments are mostly gravel and range from 0 to 40 percent.  Structure is massive or single grain.  Consistence is nonsticky and nonplastic."

This series was classified using the 8th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\n4.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Organic materials feature - the zone from 0 to 20 inches (Oa horizons).\nb. Terric feature - the zone from 20 to 65 inches (Cg horizons).\nc. Euic feature - the pH is greater  than 4.5 in .01 molar calcium chloride in some part of the organic materials (Oa2 horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
