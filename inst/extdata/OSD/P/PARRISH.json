  "OVERVIEW": "The Parrish series is a member of the fine, vermiculitic, mesic family of Ultic Haploxeralfs.  Typically, Parrish soils have pale brown and brown, gravelly loam A1 horizons, reddish brown, strongly acid, gravelly clay Bt2 horizons over metamorphosed sandstone at depths of about 26 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.   The mean annual soil temperature at a depth or 20 inches is 57 degrees to 59 degrees F.  The soil between depths of about 5 and 15 inches is usually moist all of the time from late October until early May.  Usually it is dry all the rest of the year. The A1 horizon is brown, grayish brown, light brown, light brownish gray or pale brown in 7.5YR or 10YR hue.  The Bt1 horizon has 7.5YR or 5YR hue.  Moist value and moist chroma are 2, 3, or 4 to as deep as 8 inches, but are more than 3.5 below 8 inches.  The A horizon has weak to moderate structure in some pedons and is massive and hard in some or all parts in other pedons.  It is slightly or medium acid.  This horizon has 3 to 6 percent organic matter in the upper part and less than 1 percent below 8 inches.  Its lower boundary is gradual or a transitional Bt1 horizon.  The Bt2 horizon is reddish brown, red, or yellowish red in 2.5YR or 5YR hue.  It is clay loam or clay and has 35 to 45 percent clay except that the upper and lower few inches have less than 35 percent clay.  This horizon has medium to coarse angular or subangular blocky structure.  It is medium to very strongly acid and contains 50 to 75 percent base saturation (sum of bases.)  Some pedons have a thin B3 horizon and may have a C horizon above bedrock."

Coarsegold, Contra Costa, Rescue, and Sobrante soils have a base saturation of more than 75 percent and a soil temperature above 59 degrees F.  Cornutt soils have mixed mineralogy and formed in serpentinitic material.  Guenoc soils have hue of 2.5YR or redder and value of 3 or less in the argillic horizon, soil temperature of about 60 degrees F. and have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Manzanita and Veneta soils lack a lithic contact above 40 inches.  Los Gatos and Supan soils have mollic epipedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  The Parrish soils are on hillslopes on foothills at elevations of 900 to 4,850 feet.  They formed in residuum weathered from sedimentary and meta-sedimentary rocks mostly of the Franciscan Formation.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with mean annual precipitation of 20 to 60 inches and with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees to 57 degrees F., average January temperature about 35 degrees to 41 degrees F., and average July temperature about 72 degrees F.  The freeze-free season is 150 to 210 days."
