Driest during May and June.  Typic aridic soil moisture regime.\nSoil temperature - 66 to 72 degrees F.\nRock fragments - Averages 5 to 35 percent fine and medium gravel.  Surface layer averages 5 to 65 percent gravel.\nDepth to compacted unconsolidated sediments - 8 to 20 inches\nReaction - Ranges from neutral in the upper part to strongly alkaline in the lower compacted layers\nA horizon\nHue:  7.5YR, 5YR\nValue:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist\nChroma:  2, 3, or 4, dry or moist\nBt horizon\nHue:  5YR, 7.5YR\nValue:  4, 5, or 6 dry, 3, 4, or 5 moist\nChroma:  3, 4, or 6, dry or moist\nTexture:  sandy clay loam, clay loam, sandy loam (averages 18 to 35 percent clay)\nCd horizon\nHue: 5YR, 7.5YR\nValue: 7 or 8 dry, 6 or 7 moist\nChroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist\nTexture: When crushed, includes coarse sandy loam, loamy coarse sand, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, fine sand, loamy sand\nConsistence: Brittle and firm or very firm when moist.  Typically breaks down after prolonged soaking and shaking in water.  Roots can enter the matrix when moist but is root restrictive when dry.\nGenesis:  Thought to be Pleistocene age sediments that were naturally compacted by a combination of paleo lake water loading and impregnation by calcium carbonate and low levels of silica."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Palos Verdes soils are on relict fan terraces.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  They formed in fan alluvium from granite, gneiss, schist, rhyolite, latite and volcanic ash.  Elevations range from 2200 to 3600 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches, falling as thundershowers and as gentle rains in winter.  Mean annual air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 230 to 280 days."

These layers are not duripans but are intergrades between rock (paralithic) material and unconsolidated alluvium.  They are root restrictive when dry but not restrictive when moist.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 1 inch (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 3 to 19 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btk horizons)\nCompacted layers - The zone from 19 to 64 inches (2Cdk1, 2Cdk2 horizons)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
