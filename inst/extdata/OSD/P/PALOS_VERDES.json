  "OVERVIEW": "The Palos Verdes series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fan alluvium from granitic, volcanic and metamorphic rocks.  Palos Verdes soils are on relict fan terraces and have slopes of 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 67 degrees F.",

These layers are not duripans but are intergrades between rock (paralithic) material and unconsolidated alluvium.  They are root restrictive when dry but not restrictive when moist.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 1 inch (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 3 to 19 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btk horizons)\nCompacted layers - The zone from 19 to 64 inches (2Cdk1, 2Cdk2 horizons)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
