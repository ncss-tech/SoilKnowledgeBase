  "OVERVIEW": "The Portville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in colluvium from interbedded shale, siltstone and fine-grained sandstone. They are nearly level to sloping soils on upland hillsides, benches, and footslopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Permeability is moderate in the upper solum and moderately slow or slow in the lower solum and substratum. Mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches and mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F.",
