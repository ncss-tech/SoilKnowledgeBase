  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Abbottstown, Buckingham, Gresham, Ravenna and Venango series are in the same family. Abbottstown is deep to bedrock and is formed in red residual material. Buckingham soils are Northern Piedmont soils derived from red and gray metamorphic materials and allow 5YR hue in the solum. Gresham, Ravenna, and Venango soils have glacial till parent material.\nThe Napoli series is in a related family. Napoli soils have glacial till parent material. The Brinkerton, Cavode, Londo and Sargeant series are in related families. Brinkerton soils have grayer subsoils and are in depressions. Cavode soils have clay content greater than 35 percent in the subsoil. Londo and Sargeant soils have tongues of albic material in the argillic horizon. Gilpin, Blairton, and Dekalb soils are related series that have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches."

The soil developed in colluvium weathered from interbedded shale, siltstone and fine-grained sandstone. Mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches, and the growing season ranges from 120 to 150 days. These soils are at elevations of 1400 to 1800 feet."

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 12 inches (Ap and E horizons).\nb. Argillic horizon - the zone from 12 to 50 inches (Bt and Btx horizons).\nc. Fragipan - the zone from 12 to 50 inches (Btx horizon).\nd. Aqualfs suborder - aquic moisture regime, and evidence of wetness that includes redoximorphic features, 2 chroma ped face colors in the zone from 12 to 22 inches (Btx horizon), and iron depletions immediately below the Ap horizon (E horizon).\ne.
