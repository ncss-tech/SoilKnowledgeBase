  "OVERVIEW": "The Parent series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils that formed in loamy glacial till on ground moraines and inter-drumlins. These soils have a densic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the upper part and very slow in the dense till. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches.",
