    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the densic material is 40 to 60 inches. Rock fragments of mixed lithology but mostly of igneous origin make up 1 to 15 percent by volume throughout the profile. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick. Stony and very stony phases are recognized.\nSome pedons have an O horizon 4 inches thick.\nThe A or Ap and AB horizons have hue of 10YR or neutral, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 0 or 1. The A horizon commonly is loam or fine sandy loam and less commonly sandy loam, silty clay loam or silt loam. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. It has distinct or prominent redox features. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 5YR or less commonly 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral. Bulk density ranges from 1.65 to 1.95 gm/cc.\nThe BCd horizon has hue of 5YR or less commonly 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral. Bulk density ranges from 1.85 to 2.0 gm/cc."

They commonly are on broad areas or depressions in gently undulating ground moraines and in swales on inter-drumlin topography. Parent soils formed in noncalcareous dense Superior lobe loamy till of late Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 33 inches. Frost-free days range from 90 to 145. Elevation above sea level ranges from 670 to 1450 feet."
