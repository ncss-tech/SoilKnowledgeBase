  "REVDATE": "12/2005",
  "STATES": "AS,PB",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Puapua series consists of shallow, well-drained soils on uplands. These soils formed in volcanic ash and are underlain by hard tuff. Slope is 0 to 100 percent. Elevation is near sea level to 400 feet. The mean annual rainfall is about 140 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 80 degrees F.",
