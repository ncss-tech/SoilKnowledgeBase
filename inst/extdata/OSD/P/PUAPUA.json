  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Puapua soils are on nearly level uplands to very steep slopes associated with cinder cones and craters. Slope is 0 to 100 percent. These soils formed in volcanic ash and are underlain by hard tuff at depths of 10 to 20 inches. Elevation is near sea level to 400 feet. The mean annual rainfall is 120 to 160 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 80 degrees F."
