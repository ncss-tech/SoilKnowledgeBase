  "OVERVIEW": "The Plome series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in materials locally transported from sedimentary arkosic beds or in red eolian material over sandstone.  Plome soils are on hills, ridges, and fan remnants and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature about 43 degrees F.",

The soil formed in parent materials which have been locally transported from red and reddish brown sedimentary arkosic beds of the Fountain and Lyons formations or in red eolian material over sandstone.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches, approximately 2/3 of which falls during the months of April through August.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 50 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F."
