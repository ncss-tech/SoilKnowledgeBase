  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Plome soils are on upland hills, hills on half grabens, fan remnants, and ridges.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  Elevations range from 6,500 to 8,600 feet. The soil formed in parent materials which have been locally transported from red and reddish brown sedimentary arkosic beds of the Fountain and Lyons formations or in red eolian material over sandstone.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches, approximately 2/3 of which falls during the months of April through August.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 50 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F."
