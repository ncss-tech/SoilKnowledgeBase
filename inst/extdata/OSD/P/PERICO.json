  "OVERVIEW": "The Perico series consists of very deep, well drained, and moderately permeable soils. These soils formed in calcareous, loamy eolian sediments of Quaternary age.  They are on nearly level to gently sloping eolian plains. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in), and mean annual air temperature is 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
