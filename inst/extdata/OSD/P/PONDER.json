  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 60 to more than 80 inches thick.  Depth to secondary carbonates ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  The COLE ranges from 0.08 to 0.11 in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon.  Undisturbed areas have weakly expressed gilgai microrelief.  Chert pebbles, small ironstone fragments, and dark concretions range from none to a few throughout.\nThe A horizon averages less than 10 inches thick in more than 50 percent of the pedon.  It typically ranges from 4 to 6 inches thick on subsoil crests and 7 to 12 inches thick in subsoil troughs.  Colors are in hue of 7.5YR and 10YR, value of 3 through 5, chroma of 2 through 4.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, or loam.  The reaction ranges from medium acid through neutral.\nTexture of the Bt horizons is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam with clay content of 35 to 50 percent.  The Bt1 horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 2 through 4.  Subsoil crests usually have redder color than subsoil troughs and the centers of some troughs are dark gray.  The reaction ranges from medium acid through neutral.\nThe lower Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 5, chroma of 2 through 8.  Reddish or brownish mottles range from none to common.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe BCK horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7, chroma of 2 through 6.  It is silty clay loam, silt loam, or clay loam.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 20 to more than 60 percent.  Concretions and soft masses of carbonates ranges from common to many.\nThe C horizon, when encountered, is brownish, grayish, or whitish calcareous loamy material with or without weakly cemented chalk strata or limestone fragments."

Normangee and Steedman soils have sola less than 60 inches thick.  Crockett soils have an abrupt textural change between the A and Bt horizon.  Navo soils lack a 20 percent decrease in clay within 60 inches of the soil surface.  Payne and Thurber soils have COLE of less than 0.07."

The soil formed in calcareous marine sediments of the Lower Cretaceous system.  Climate is moist subhumid.  Mean annual rainfall ranges from 26 to 34 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 62 to 69 degrees F.  Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 42 to 58."
