  "OVERVIEW": "The Portillo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum weathered from granitic sandstone, siltstone, and fanglomerate.  Portillo soils are on backslopes of eroded fan remnants.  Slopes are 25 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
