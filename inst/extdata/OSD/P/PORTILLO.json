    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Portillo soils are on backslopes of eroded fan remnants.  They formed in colluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum weathered from Tertiary granitic sandstone, siltstone, and fanglomerate.  Slopes are 25 to 50 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,900 to 7,400 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 15 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.    The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free  period is 140 to 160 days."

Encantado soils are sandy-skeletal, have ochric epipedons and calcic horizons, and occur on backslopes of eroded fan remnants generally below Portillo soils.  Junebee soils are coarse-loamy, have thick mollic epipedons, and occur on adjacent toeslopes of eroded fan remnants.  Pedregal soils are loamy-skeletal, have ochric epipedons, and occur on adjacent narrow beveled summits and  shoulders."
