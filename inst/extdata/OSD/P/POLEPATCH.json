  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Average annual soil temperature is 41 to 43 degree F.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of more than 1.0 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent.  The 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section is 10 to 40 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregates and 60 to 85 percent basalt fragments.\nThe A and AC horizons have value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Rock fragments range from 20 to 35 percent pebbles, 5 to 25 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent stones. Boulders range from 3 to 5 percent on the soil surface.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has value of 2 to 5 moist, 4 through 8 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.  Rock fragments average from 30 to 40 percent pebbles, 20 to 30 percent cobbles and 5 to 20 percent stones.  It is typically extremely cobbly loamy sand, extremely cobbly sand, or extremely stony coarse sand.  Some pedons lack thin horizons of fine sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral."

Polepatch soils formed in basaltic lahar material from the  350-year-old, Kalama eruptive period, and a thin mantle of ash from the 176-year-old \"Layer T\" from Mt. St. Helens. The climate is characterized by warm, moist summers and cold, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 115 to 140 inches including considerable snowfall.  Average January temperature is 20 degrees F.; average July temperature is 59 degrees F.; and the average annual temperature is 38 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 70 to 90 days."
