  "OVERVIEW": "The Pico series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mostly sedimentary rocks.  Pico soils are on floodplains and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 59 degrees to 64 degrees F., and the soil temperature rarely if ever is below 47 degrees F.  Soil between the depths of about 8 to 24 inches usually is dry all the time from May until mid-November or early December and usually is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.  The 10- to 40-inch control section is dominantly sandy loam, fine sandy loam or light loam and averages about 14 to 18 percent clay.  There is a slight to distinct stratification in some part of the soil profile.  Rock fragments range in volume from about 1 to 20 percent, but in most pedons are less than 5 percent.  After cultivation the soils are weakly to strongly effervescent in all parts.  Few to common fine lime segregations are present in some or most parts between depths of about 25 to 45 inches.\nThe A horizon is gray, brown, grayish brown or dark grayish brown and the hue is 10YR or 2.5Y.  It has weak or moderate structure or the horizon is massive and slightly hard.  Organic matter content ranges from 1 1/2 to 4 percent and below plow depth decreases irregularly to less than 1 percent at a depth of 20 inches.\nThe C horizon is grayish brown, light brownish gray, pale brown, very pale brown or light gray and the hue is 10YR or 2.5Y."

Arroyo Seco and Elder soils are not calcareous in any part.  Goleta soils are calcareous below about 36 inches.  Agueda soils have more than 18 percent clay and a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick.  Anacapa soils are not calcareous in the A horizon.  Hanford, Honcut, and San Emigdio soils have ochric epipedons with less than 1 percent organic matter to a depth of 7 inches.  Mocho soils have more than 18 percent clay.  Reiff soils have hard and massive ochric epipedons.  Sorrento and Vina soils have more than 18 percent clay and are not calcareous in the A horizon."

They formed in alkaline, moderately coarse textured alluvium derived mostly from sedimentary formations.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 20 inches.  Average January temperature is about 53 degrees F., average July temperature is about 66 degrees F., and annual temperature is about 58 degrees to 62 degrees F.  The freeze-free season is about 200 to 300 days."
