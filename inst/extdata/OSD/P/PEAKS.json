  "OVERVIEW": "The Peaks series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils on ridge tops and convex side slopes in the Blue Ridge province.  Slopes range from 0 to 90 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F near the type location.",

Brownsville, Cadosia, Cloverlick, Deadline, Highsplint, Jubin and Warwick soils do not have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  Berks and Blasdell soils have coarse fragments dominated by shale.  Judyville, Matewan and Solon soils have coarse fragments dominated by sandstone.  Brownstown soils average more than 40 percent silt in the fine-earth fraction of the control section.  Calvin soils have 5YR hue or redder in the B and C horizon. Keyesville soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Nailkeg soils have a mean annual soil temperature less than 54 degrees F.  Wyoming soils have water rounded gravel and do not have bedrock within 40 inches. Lippitt soils are formed in glacial till over weathered gneiss, granite or schist bedrock. Manlius soils formed in glacial till over shaly bedrock. Sylco soils have coarse fragments dominated by phyllite bedrock."

Other minor revisions were made.\nThe 9/2008 revision updates the Competing Series and adjusts the thickness of the C horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon-0 to 3 inches (A and E horizons).\nb.  Cambic horizon-1 to 24 inches (E and Bw horizons).\nc.  Rock fragments-average more than 35 percent in the 10 to 33 inch control section.\nThe 11/2021 revision: Oi had 1 to 0 inch depths, corrected to be 0 to 1 in horizon depths then added 1 inch to all horizon depths throughout the typical pedon.\nSIR = VA0287, VA0310 (stony)\nMLRA=130\nRevised: 2/1999-MKC; 9/2005-JAK,DHK; 9/2008-DGF; 12/2021 -WJN\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
