  "OVERVIEW": "The Puffer series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from sedimentary rocks.  Puffer soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
