Halii soils contain more organic carbon and have moderate or weaker structure in the A horizon, a clay loam control section, and bands of 7.5YR material in the B horizon.  Kappa soils have weak structure in the A and B horizons.  Kunuweia soils have mean annual soil temperature of 58 degrees F., and the A horizon overlies plinthite.  Puhi soils have a silty clay loam control section and relative high base status."

Slope ranges from nearly level to 40 percent.  The soils formed in material weathered from basic igneous rock, with some admixture of volcanic ash.
