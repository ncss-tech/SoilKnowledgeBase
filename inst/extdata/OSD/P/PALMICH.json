These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts for 75 to 90 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.95 g/cc, volcanic glass content of more than 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent and 35 to 80 percent pumice.  Depth to the 2Bw3 horizon is greater than 40 inches.\nThe A and AB horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry and chroma of l through 3 dry or moist.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe Bw1 horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is paragravelly ashy sandy loam, paragravelly ashy fine sandy loam, or very paragravelly ashy sandy loam. It has 0 to 5 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe Bw2 horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  It is very paragravelly ashy sandy loam, very paragravelly ashy fine sandy loam or extremely paragravelly ashy sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.  Some pedons have layers of extremely paragravelly ashy sand with dry value of 2, 7, or 8 and dry chroma of l, 2, or 8.  It has 0 to 5 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe 2Bw3 horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, very cobbly sandy loam, or gravelly sandy loam.  Reaction moderately acid to neutral."

These soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice over colluvium mostly from granodiorite or rhyolite and some from gneiss and schist. These soils are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 35 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 66 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 to 44 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F is about l40 to l70 days."
