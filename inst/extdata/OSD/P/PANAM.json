  "OVERVIEW": "The Panam series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy, eolian and storm washover sediments on barrier islands.  These nearly level or very gently sloping soils are on low stabilized dunes on barrier flats.  These soils are subject to occasional flooding by high storm surge from strong tropical storms.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).",
