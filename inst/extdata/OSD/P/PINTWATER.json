  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pintwater series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from rhyolite, ignimbrite, welded tuff, basalt and related rocks.  Pintwater soils are on mountain slopes, rock pediments and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
