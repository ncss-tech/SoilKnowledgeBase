  "OVERVIEW": "The Plite series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium from intermediate and basic igneous rocks.  Plite soils occur on alluvial fans and in narrow drainageways.  They have slopes of 2 to 8 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The soil moisture regime is ustic bordering on aridic.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is sandy loam or clay loam and has 0 to 5 percent gravel.  The clay loam surface layer where present is less than 15 inches thick.  The A horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is dominantly sandy loam with layers of loamy sand or loam, with 0 to 5 percent rock fragments and 5 to 18 percent clay.  This horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline."
