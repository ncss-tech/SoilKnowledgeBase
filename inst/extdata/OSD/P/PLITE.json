The soil moisture regime is ustic bordering on aridic.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is sandy loam or clay loam and has 0 to 5 percent gravel.  The clay loam surface layer where present is less than 15 inches thick.  The A horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is dominantly sandy loam with layers of loamy sand or loam, with 0 to 5 percent rock fragments and 5 to 18 percent clay.  This horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline."
