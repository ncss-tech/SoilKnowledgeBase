    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 61 to 66 degrees F.  The moisture control section in most years is moist in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days in April and May, dry in all parts for 60 or more consecutive days immediately following July 1, and moist in some but not all parts in October through March.  Depth to contrasting clayey substratum is 15 to 30 inches.  Depth to calcium carbonate ranges from 25 to 40 inches.  The paralithic contact is at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  The upper part of the particle-size control section averages 12 to 18 percent clay, 10 to 20 percent silt, and 60 to 80 percent sand. The lower part of the control section ranges from 35 to 50 percent clay, 30 to 40 percent silt, and 10 to 25 percent sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe 2BC or 3BC horizons have hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Clay content averages 10 to 40 percent.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.  Pebbles range from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe 3C horizon has variegated colors with hues of 5GY to 2.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is clay loam or clay.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Powderwash soils are on hillslopes and benches.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The soil formed in materials with contrasting textures.  The upper half of the soil formed in aeolian and residuum from sandstones.  The lower half formed in residuum derived from clay shales.  Elevation ranges from 6,100 to 6,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 11 to 13 inches and is evenly distributed throughout the year.  July is the driest month for the growing season.  Over 50 percent of the precipitation is received as snow.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F. and mean summer temperature ranges from 63 to 68 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 75 to 95 days."
