Bayboro, Byars, Cape Fear, Ellabelle, Hyde, Johnston, Lumbee, Paxville, Pocomoke, Portsmouth, Rains, Surrency, Torhunta, and Weeksville series are in closely related families.  Bayboro, Byars, and Cape Fear soils have Btg horizons containing more than 35 percent clay.  Ellabelle and Surrency soils have arenic umbric epipedons.  Hyde soils have mixed mineralogy.  Johnston, Torhunta, and Weeksville soils lack Btg horizons.   Lumbee and Rains soils have ochric epipedons and, in addition, Lumbee soils have thinner sola.  Pocomoke soils have sandy BCg horizons at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Portsmouth soils have mixed mineralogy and a decrease in clay of 20 percent or more within 60 inches of the surface."
