  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 16 to 40 inches over the dense till substratum. Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent, by volume, in the silty mantle and from 5 to 35 percent in the lower part of the subsoil and substratum that is in till. Rock fragments include gravel, cobbles, and stones. Stones occupy as much as 15 percent of some layers. The surficial mantle contains 50 through 80 percent silt plus very fine sand.\nThe O horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Some undisturbed pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid.\nIn cleared areas, an Ap horizon is present with hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. It has weak or moderate fine or medium granular structure and friable or very friable consistence. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of l or 2. Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. It has thin or medium platy or subangular blocky structure, or fine granular structure. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. It has weak or moderate fine or medium subangular blocky structure and friable or very friable consistence. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid. Some pedons have a Bhs horizon with a value and chroma of 3 or less.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 8; or hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value 3 through 5 and chroma of 4 through 6. The lighter colors are more common in the lower part. Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam with subhorizons of loamy very fine sand in some pedons. The Bs horizon has very weak, weak, or moderate subangular blocky or granular structure and friable or very friable consistence. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid. Some pedons have a BC or C horizon under the Bs horizon.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture of the fine earth fraction ranges from silt loam through loamy sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through neutral. Some pedons have a BC or C horizon under the Bs horizon.\nThe 2Cd horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand or loamy fine sand in the fine-earth fraction. It is massive, with or without plate-like divisions. In some pedons the upper part of the substratum is prismatic. Consistence is firm or very firm.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid through slightly alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bangor, Berkshire, DeKapen, Elliottsville, Groveton, Houghtonville, Penquis, Revel, Tunbridge, and Welcome series in the same family. Bangor soils lack a lithologic discontinuity and have silt loam or loam textures in the substratum within the series control section. Berkshire, Groveton, and Houghtonville soils lack a Cd horizon in dense till within the series control section. DeKapen soils have more than 25 percent weathered pebbles in the solum. Elliottsville, Penquis, Revel, and Tunbridge soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Welcome soils have lower effective precipitation and are dry in the soil moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days within the four month period that follows the summer solstice."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Potsdam soils occupy undulating to steep, typically convex landforms of till plains and glaciated mountain sides. Slope ranges from 3 through 60 percent. The regolith is fine sandy loam through loamy sand till from sandstone, schist, or granite gneiss overlain by an 16 to 40 inch eolian or lacustrine mantle containing 50 to 80 percent silt plus very fine sand. Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 through 45 degrees F, mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 through 55 inches, and mean frost-free days ranges from 90 through 145 days. Elevation ranges from 500 through 2000 feet above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: They moderately well drained Crary soils form a drainage sequence with Potsdam soils and occupy footslopes and other less convex areas. The competing Becket and Marlow soils are in nearby areas that lack a nearly stone-free surficial mantle. Worth soils occur in areas that have a fragipan. Tunbridge soils are associated where bedrock is at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Other geographically associated soils are the Adams, Berkshire, and Colton soils. Adams and Colton soils are in glaciofluvial sand and gravel deposits. The competing Berkshire soils are on associated till plains, but lack a dense substratum."

Woodlots contain sugar maple, American beech, black ash, white ash, hop hornbeam, eastern hemlock, red oak, and eastern white pine."

    "content": "REMARKS: Reclassification (1/89) of these soils from Fragiorthods to Haplorthods reflects the fact that in most areas the dense substratum was formerly identified as a Cx horizon which is now a Cd horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons recognized in the typical pedon are:\na. Ochric Epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (Oa and E horizon).\nb. Spodic horizon - the zone from 6 to 19 inches (Bh and Bs horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
