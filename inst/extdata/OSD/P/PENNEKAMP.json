  "REVDATE": "10/2018",
  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pennekamp series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to rippable coral limestone.  Pennekamp soils formed in material weathered from the coral limestone, usually with a thin overburden of sapric organic material.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",
