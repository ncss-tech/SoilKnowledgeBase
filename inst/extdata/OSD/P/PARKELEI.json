Arnor soils are underlain by weathered granite at 60 to 80 inches.  Augustine soils have the base of the argillic horizon at 25 to 40 inches. Bosonoak soils are effervescent to the surface.  Carri, Celacy, Celavar, Evpark, Gateson, Nyjack, Oldwolf, and Ribera soils are moderately deep to a lithic or paralithic contact.  Dermala and Iwela soils, have greater than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Flugle and Pinitos soils have the base of the argillic horizon greater than 30 inches.  Pinitos soils do not allow rock fragments.  Lykorly and Orlie soils have less than 35 percent sand in the particle-size control section.  Arnor, Arwite, Bigbow, Dalhart, Deekay, Elwop, Fort Collins, Gateson, Oldwolf, Olnest, Rauzi, Ribera, Rockybutte, Stoneham, Toluca, and Wagonhound soils receive most of the annual precipitation in the spring and fall and are in LRR-E or LRR-G.  Navajita soils have 20 to 30 percent volcanic glass and 2 to 15 percent para rocks."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Parkelei soils formed in eolian and alluvium, fan alluvium, and slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Parkelei soils are on summits of mesas and plateaus, dipslopes of cuestas, drainageways, fan remnants on valley sides, stream terraces, structural benches and hills. Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 5,270 to 8,000 feet. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 59 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 13 to 18 inches. The frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."

Bryway and Evpark soils are moderately deep to shale and sandstone. Highdye, Toldohn, and Vessilla soils are very shallow and shallow to sandstone and shale. Concho and Hosta soils are fine textured.
