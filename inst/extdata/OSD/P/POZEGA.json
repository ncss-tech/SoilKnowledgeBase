  "OVERVIEW": "The Pozega series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium. These soils are on low stream terraces and glacial outwash plains. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
