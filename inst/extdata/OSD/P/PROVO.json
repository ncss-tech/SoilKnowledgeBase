  "OVERVIEW": "The Provo series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that were formed in gravelly alluvium derived from igneous, sandstone, limestone, and quartzite rocks.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping alluvial fans and floodplains.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 9.0 degrees C., and the average annual precipitation is about 360 mm.",
