  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 60 to 80 inches thick.  Soft powdery bodies of calcium carbonate occur at depths of 28 to 50 inches.\nThe A horizon has colors in shades of brown with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or clay loam and slightly acid or neutral.  The A horizon is massive and hard or very hard when dry, but ranges from massive to weak granular structure when moist.\nThe Bt horizon has colors in shades of brown with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4, chroma of 2 to 4.  The Btk horizon commonly has red or brown mottles.  The Bt horizons are clay or clay loam with clay content of 35 to 45 percent.  The reaction of the Bt1 horizon ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  The lower Bt horizons are mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline and noneffervescent to strongly effervescent.\nThe BCk horizon has colors in shades of red or brown with or without mottles of these colors.  It is clay or clay loam.  Calcium carbonate concretions and masses range from 3 to 10 percent by volume.  It is slightly to strongly effervescent.  Beds of gravel or sand and gravel are at depths of 6 to 15 feet in some pedons."

Bastrop soils have less than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Crockett and Normangee soils have mottled Bt horizons and cracks that are 1 cm or more wide at a depth of 20 inches when dry.  Also, Normangee soils have sola less than 60 inches thick.  Pedernales soils have mixed mineralogy and sola less than 60 inches thick.  San Antonio and Thurber soils have secondary carbonates at depths less than 28 inches, and in addition, San Antonio soils have mean annual soil temperatures greater than 72 degrees F."
