  "OVERVIEW": "The Pino series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed from alluvium or slope alluvium derived from limestone, shale and sandstone.  Pino soils are on ridges and hillslopes with slopes of 2 to 55 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Alder, Billman, and Mishakal soils have a paralithic contact. Bacbuster, Bigbear, and Durston soils have accumulations of secondary carbonates. Wilcoxson soils lack lithic contacts at depths less than 40 inches. Charo and Darret soils have hues redder than 7.5YR. In addition, Darret soils have lime accumulations in the B horizon. Microy soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments. Bigbear, Durstan and Roaringlion soils are very deep."
