Alder, Billman, and Mishakal soils have a paralithic contact. Bacbuster, Bigbear, and Durston soils have accumulations of secondary carbonates. Wilcoxson soils lack lithic contacts at depths less than 40 inches. Charo and Darret soils have hues redder than 7.5YR. In addition, Darret soils have lime accumulations in the B horizon. Microy soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments. Bigbear, Durstan and Roaringlion soils are very deep."

Slope gradients of 2 through 55 percent are common to these soils.  The climate is semiarid continental.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 20 inches.  The average annual temperature is 42 degrees F., and the average annual summer temperature is 65 degrees F."
