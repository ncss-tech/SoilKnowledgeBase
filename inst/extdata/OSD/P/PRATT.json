(Bt)\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy: Twelfth edition, 2014\n2/08/95: Update series for Oklahoma\n1/2017 BKN Added slope range to intro. Added on a north facing, convex, 1 percent slope and at an elevation of 547 meters (1,794 feet) to typical pedon. Added clay and sand content to RIC. Added precipitation pattern to geographic setting. Removed Carway, Carwile, Hayes, Langdon, Shellabarger, Tivoli, Turon, and Warnut soils from geographically associated soils. Changed permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.\nADDITIONAL DATA: For additional information refer to Soil Survey Investigation Report No. 4, pages 56 to 59. Pratt TP 93KS155129.
