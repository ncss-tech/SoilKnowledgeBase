  "OVERVIEW": "The Plankinton series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in local alluvium and glacial till in depressions and drainageways on uplands.  Permeability is slow or very slow.  Slopes are less than 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches.",

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Barbert, Chauncey, Edina, Fillmore, Goose Lake, Massie, Rolfe, Scott, and Sperry series in the same family. Babert soils formed in lacustrine sediments and have a wetter climate.  Chauncey, Edina, Rolfe, and Sperry soils have wetter climates.  In addition, Sperry and Edina are leached of carbonate to greater depths and Rolfe soils are more acid in the solum.  Fillmore and Scott soils formed in loess and Scott soils are more poorly drained and Fillmore soils have a thicker A horizon.  Goose Lake soils formed in sediments weathered from tuff, rhyolite, and basalt.  The very poorly drained Massie soils do not have carbonate above depths of 50 inches."
