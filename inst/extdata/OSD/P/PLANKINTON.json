It is medium acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Few to many, distinct or prominent mottles are in most pedons.  It is medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  It is silty clay, clay, silty clay loam or clay loam.  Clay content typically is about 50 percent, but ranges from 38 to 60 percent.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 3 to 5 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or less.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Barbert, Chauncey, Edina, Fillmore, Goose Lake, Massie, Rolfe, Scott, and Sperry series in the same family. Babert soils formed in lacustrine sediments and have a wetter climate.  Chauncey, Edina, Rolfe, and Sperry soils have wetter climates.  In addition, Sperry and Edina are leached of carbonate to greater depths and Rolfe soils are more acid in the solum.  Fillmore and Scott soils formed in loess and Scott soils are more poorly drained and Fillmore soils have a thicker A horizon.  Goose Lake soils formed in sediments weathered from tuff, rhyolite, and basalt.  The very poorly drained Massie soils do not have carbonate above depths of 50 inches."

They formed in local alluvial sediments overlying glacial till.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 26 inches."

Clarno, Ethan, and Houdek soils are well drained and are on higher parts of the landscape.  Dudley, Prosper, and Stickney soils are moderately well drained and are in swales and nearly level upland positions.  In addition, Dudley and Stickney soils have natric horizon.  Hoven, Tetonka and Worthing soils are on similar landscapes. Hoven soils have a natric horizons.  Tetonka soils have thicker A horizons and lack an abrupt textural change from the albic to the argillic horizon.  Worthing soils do not have E horizons."
