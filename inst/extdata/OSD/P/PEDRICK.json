  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Color of the A horizon may range in hue from 7.5YR to 2.5Y, in chroma from 2 to 4, and in value from 5 to 7 when dry and 3 to 5 when moist.  When as dark as 5 dry and 3 moist the total thickness must be less than 4 inches.  Hue of the C horizon may range from 10YR to 5Y.  The lower part of the control section contains much calcium carbonate, gypsum, and other salts usually in finely divided or crystalline forms.  Usually these soils have a hummocky surface, and in some areas sufficient wind reworking may have taken place to have created small dunes.  Texture of the control section varies with the degree of stratification but in average terms is a sandy loam.  It may range in clay from 2 to 15 percent, in sand from 60 to 85 percent, and in silt from 0 to 30 percent excluding coarse loamy sand.  pH of the control section ranges from 8.0 to 8.8 with pH, salt content and conductivity increasing with depth.  Depth to bedrock should be greater than 40 inches."
