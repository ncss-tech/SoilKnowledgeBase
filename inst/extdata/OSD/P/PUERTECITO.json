  "OVERVIEW": "The Puertecito series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from volcanic and sedimentary rocks.  Puertecito soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 55 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
