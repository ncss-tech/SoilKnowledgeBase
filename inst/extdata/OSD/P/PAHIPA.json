The soils formed in basic volcanic ash in `a`a lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 1,524 to 2,540 millimeters (60 to 100 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 640 to 1,270 meters (25 to 50 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 15 degrees C (52 to 59 degrees F). The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
