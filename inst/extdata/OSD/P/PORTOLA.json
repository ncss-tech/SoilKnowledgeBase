  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches varies from 42 to 47 degrees. The mean summer soil temperature is 60 to 63 degrees. The soil moisture control section is usually moist in some or all parts from late October to mid July and is dry in all parts the rest of the year. Rock fragments of gravel and cobbles range from 5 to 35 percent throughout the profile. The soil is slightly to medium acid. The soil from a depth of about 10 inches to a paralithic contact is assumed to be dominated by amorphous material based on lab data from similar surrounding soils.\nThe A horizon has dry colors of N6/; N7/; 10YR 5/2, 6/1, 6/2, 6/3, 7/1 or 7/2. Moist colors are 10YR 3/3, 3/2; 7.5YR 4/2 or 4/3. Where Mollic colors exist the horizon is less than 10 inches thick. It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loamy sand and may be gravelly. Bulk density averages about 0.85 to 1.0 g/cc.\nThe B horizon has dry colors of 7.5YR 6/4; 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 7/3, 7/4, 8/3 or 8/4. Moist colors are 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 10YR 4/2, 4/3, or 5/3. It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam and may be gravelly or cobbly. Bulk density averages from about 0.9 to 1.0. The 15 bar water to clay ratio is about 1 to 1.5."
