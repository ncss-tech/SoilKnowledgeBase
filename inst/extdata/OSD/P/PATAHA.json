    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to secondary lime is 10 to 20 inches and depth to a calcic horizon is 17 to 34 inches.  Depth to a lithic contact is 30 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 49 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days during summer and fall.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and is 15 to 35 percent fragments.  The mollic epipedon is 24 to 34 inches thick and includes the A, ABk, and Bk horizons.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist.\nThe Bk horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is gravelly silt loam or silt loam.\nThe 2Bqk horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly loam, extremely cobbly loam, or very cobbly loam.  The coarse fragments include 20 to 50 percent lime-silica indurated pebbles and lime-silica coated basalt fragments."
