  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pagecreek soils are on stream terraces at foothills of mountains that typically occur adjacent to incised drainages. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed parent materials dominated by welded tuff. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 1,900 to 2,450 meters. The climate is dry-subhumid, continental with cool, moist winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm but the geomorphic surface receives a significant amount of surface water run on from surrounding uplands. The mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."
