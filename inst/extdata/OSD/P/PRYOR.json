The electrical conductivity ranges from 0 to 4 millimhos in the upper 12 inches, from 2 to 8 millimhos in the 12 to 24 inch zone, from 4 to 16 millimhos in the 24 to 48 inch zone, and 8 to 16 millimhos below 48 inches.  COLE below the A horizon is 0.06 to 0.11.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown, brown, or light olive brown in hue of 10YR and 2.5Y, with value of 4 and 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  When color values are less than 5.5, when dry, and 3.5, when moist, it is less than 10 inches thick.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or clay.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 2 to 15 percent.\nThe upper B horizon is light brownish gray, brown, pale brown, yellowish brown, light yellowish brown, light olive brown, very pale brown, or pale yellow in hue of 10YR and 2.5Y, with value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is clay loam or clay with clay content ranging from 35 to about 55 percent clay. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 4 to 25 percent.\nThe lower B horizon is light yellowish brown, very pale brown, brownish yellow, olive yellow, pale yellow, or yellow in hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, and 5Y, with value of 5 through 8, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Soft masses and concretions of calcium carbonate comprise from about 1 to about 15 percent by volume.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 25 percent.\nThe Cd horizon is non-cemented claystone or interbedded noncemented claystone and sandstone.  Cracks that roots can enter are more than 4 inches apart.  Excavation difficulty when moist is low to moderate."

Slope gradients range from 0 to 5 percent but are mainly 1 to 3 percent. The soils formed in calcareous clays and clay loams over shale. The climate is hot and dry subhumid or semiarid.  Average annual precipitation is 20 to 24 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 70 to 74 degrees F.  Frost free period is 270 to 300 days, and elevation ranges from 150 to 1000 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E index is 20 to 31."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mostly as rangeland.  A few small areas are cultivated to grain sorghum or small grain.  The original plant community was an open grassland, dominated by mid grasses, with an occasional mesquite tree or woody shrub which make up about 5 percent of the vegetation.  About 5 percent were present originally.  With retrogression, woody plants such as blackbrush, guyacan, whitebrush, condalias, and spiny hackberry increase or invade.  Herbaceous plants which increase or invade are red grama, threeawn, Hall's panicum and annual weeds."
