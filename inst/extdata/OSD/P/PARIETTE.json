  "OVERVIEW": "The Pariette series consists of moderately deep over shale, well drained soils. These soils formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from shale interbedded with sandstone and siltstone. They are on fan remnants and strath terraces and have slopes of 2 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 6 inches.",
