  "OVERVIEW": "The Presa series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone and shale.  Presa soils are on steep slopes of mountains and canyons and have slopes of 15 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
