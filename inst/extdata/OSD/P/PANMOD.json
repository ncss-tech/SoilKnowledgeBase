  "OVERVIEW": "The Panmod series consists of moderately deep over duripan, well drained soils that formed in deep loess. Panmod soils are on basalt plains and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
