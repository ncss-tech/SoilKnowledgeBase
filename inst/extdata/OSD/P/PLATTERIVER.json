  "OVERVIEW": "The Platteriver series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in eolian and water worked sands on low dunes and beach ridges along Lake Michigan. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
