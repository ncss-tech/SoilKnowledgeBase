  "OVERVIEW": "The Pocum series consists of shallow to hardpan, well drained soils that formed in mixed colluvium and alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Pocum soils are on mesas and have slopes of 1 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
