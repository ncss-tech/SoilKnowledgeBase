  "REVDATE": "04/2009",
  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Potrio series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from basalt. Potrio soils are on volcanic mesas.  Slopes range from 1 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 to 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 37 to 41 degrees F.",
