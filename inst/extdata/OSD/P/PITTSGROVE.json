  "OVERVIEW": "Note:  The Pittsgrove series was established in 1998 with the correlation of Cape May County, NJ (type location, Salem County, NJ). The series concept was a soil similar to Aura soils with less that a weighted average of 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section underlain by a loamy, dense and brittle layer (fragipan). With the completion of Gloucester County, NJ (the type location for the Aura series) it was determined that Aura soils also dominantly had a coarse-loamy particle-size control section indicating no significant difference between Pittsgrove and Aura soils as mapped.  It was the preference of the state to retain the Aura name and inactivate the Pittsgrove series.  The soils mapped Pittsgrove have been recorrelated to the Aura series.\nMLRA(s): 149A, 153C, 153D\nMLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia\nDepth Class: Moderately deep to fragipan, very deep to bedrock\nDrainage Class: Well drained\nSurface Runoff: Slow to rapid\nPermeability: Moderately slow\nParent Material: Loamy and gravelly fluvial sediments\nSlope: 0 to 15 percent\nMean Annual Air Temperature (type location): 56 degrees F.\nMean Annual Precipitation (type location): 45 inches",
