  "OVERVIEW": "The Purpleheart series consists of deep or very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum of lava fields and bottoms of hillslopes. Purpleheart soils are on in-filled low positions. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
