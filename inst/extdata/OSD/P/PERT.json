The poorly drained Ziegenfuss soils and the moderately well drained Morley soils are commonly found in a drainage sequence with the Pert soils. The well drained Metea and the somewhat poorly drained Wixom soils are the main sandy associates in areas where there are sand smears over the till. Low ridges and mound-like areas of the well drained Boyer and somewhat poorly drained Wasepi soils are common associates where Pert soils border old glacial drainage channels and lakes."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Pert soils have been cleared and cropped to corn, beans, sugar beets, small grain, and hay. Some small woodlots remain in second growth cover of eastern white pine, northern red oak, red maple, quaking aspen, and paper birch. Very few areas are used for permanent pasture. Native vegetation is mixed northern hardwoods and white pine."
