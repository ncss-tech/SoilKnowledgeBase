    "content": "TYPICAL PEDON:  Penagul very gravelly clay loam--on a 60 percent smooth, northeast aspect in rangeland at 5,550 feet elevation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on September 18, 1985, the soil was dry to 2 inches and moist below this depth.)\nE--0 to 2 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine angular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 50 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.3); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 3 inches thick)\nBt--2 to 8 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine and medium angular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, very sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films lining pores and on faces of peds; 40 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)\nCr1--8 to 12 inches; fractured tuff; 4 to 6 inches between fractures and root mats on rock fragments and penetrating into fractures; tuff is soft when moist and can be excavated easily with tiling spade; tuff is hard when dry and fractures when struck with tiling spade; some interstices are not filled with soil material; gradual wavy boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)\nCr2--12 inches; fractured tuff; 4 to 6 inches between fractures; many interstices are not filled with soil material; tuff is soft when moist and hard when dry."

Elevations are 5,000 to 6,000 feet.  Climate is cold and moist in winter and dry in summer.  The average annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches; average annual temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 80 days."
