In addition, Armitage soils have greater than 15 percent coarse fragments, have a Bt1 horizon with greater than 40 percent clay, are thinner to the base of the E horizon and have carbonates and salts nearer the surface and Rominell soils are more alkaline in the A and Bt horizons.  Bullock soils are less than 5 inches to the base of the E horizon and have carbonates and salts nearer the surface."

Bullock soils are in the microrelief with the Parchin soils.  Absher soils are on similar landscapes.  They do not have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Assinniboine, Cabbart, Delridge, Marmarth, and Twilight soils are above the Parchin soils, usually are steeper, and do not have a natric horizon.  In addition, Assinniboine, Marmarth, and Rhame soils have a mollic epipedon and Cabbart soils have bedrock at depths less than 20 inches.  Loburn soils are on similar landscape postions and have a fine natric horizon.  Areas of slickspots are intermingled with the Parchin soils."
