  "OVERVIEW": "The Parchin series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum weathered from sandy and loamy sedimentary rocks.  These soils are on sloping uplands.  They have slow or very slow permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent slopes.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
