  "OVERVIEW": "The Paypoint series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from tuff over lacustrine deposits derived from basalt.  Paypoint soils are on lagoons.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
