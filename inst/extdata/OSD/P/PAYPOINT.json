    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Paypoint soils are on lagoons.  They formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from tuff over lacustrine deposits derived from basalt.  Eolian material influenced by volcanic ash is also a component of the parent material in the upper part of the profile.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,680 to 1,770 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 25o mm, the mean annual air temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
