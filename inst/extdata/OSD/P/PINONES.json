These soils except Reparada, lack buried organic layers within 40 inches of the surface.  Bajura and Santoni soils have coefficient of linear extensibility of 0.09 or more, and they have pressure faces and slickensides.  Coloso soils have slightly to medium acid reactions.  Corcega soils have sandy clay loam or silty clay loam B horizons over sandy C horizons.  Reparada and Vayas soils have neutral to moderately alkaline reactions."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Pinones soils occur on nearly level coastal lowlands with slope gradients from 0 to 2 percent.  The regolith consists of fine textured sediments of mixed origin which overlie decomposed and partially decomposed organic layers.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average yearly rainfall is 80 to 90 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 77 to 80 degrees F."
