  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil include: an albic horizon from 5 to 6 inches; a spodic horizon from 6 to 10 inches with assumed organic carbon content greater than 6 percent; cryic temperature regime; bedrock at 17 inches; weighted average particle size of loamy-skeletal from 10 to 17 inches.\nThis series could classify as a Typic Cryaquod under the 1991 revised Spodosol criteria.  This soil, however, does not exhibit the saturated conditions typical of an Aquod which is reflected in the forest productivity.  Redoximorphic features are present lower in the spodic horizon and the soil exhibits characteristics of somewhat poor drainage.   It is assumed the soil is not saturated to the surface nor does the capillary fringe extend to the surface during the year.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data is available on this soil:  NSSL Number 84P0117.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
