The type location was moved from Millard County to Box Elder County with the update of the series in 1998.  The revision of April 2005 updates the taxonomic class from Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplocalcids based on estimated soil properties for cation exchange capacity and sodium adsorption ratio in the NASIS database.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
