    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually dry; they are dry for 90 consecutive days or more in all parts between depths of about 4 and 12 inches after the summer solstice but are moist in some part for a continuous period greater than one-fourth of the time that the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 53 degrees F.  The depth to carbonates is 15 to 35 inches.  There is an absolute clay increase of 20 to 30 percent between the A and 2Bt horizons.  Depth to bedrock is over 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  The texture is clay, clay loam or silty clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay.  Clay loam and silty clay loam texture occur in the lower part.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe 3Bk horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and 4, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam or clay loam.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline."

Acoma soils have 15 to 35 percent gravel in the particle-size control section.   Borda soils have a solum thickness of 30 or 45 inches and have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches.  Bowns and Locey soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Brent, Bowns, Chardoton, and Phing soils have an E horizon.  Brent soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 50 to 54 degrees F, and Chardoton soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 52 to 56 degrees F.  Gooding soils have a hardpan over bedrock at less than 40 inches.  Mahala and Verdico soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Reba soils are slightly acid or medium acid in the surface and slightly acid or neutral in the subsoil.  Sorf soils have 20 to 60 percent stones and cobbles in or on the surface and are neutral in the surface and upper part of the Bt horizon."
