  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pomme series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in a thin mantle of loess or an admixture of loess and colluvium over colluvium or old alluvial sediments.  Some pedons have residuum from limestone, dolostone, or sandstone beneath the sediments. These soils are on structural benches, strath terraces, and footslopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",

Sonora soils do not have rock fragments in the upper part of the series control section. The Britwater and Holstein soils have an active CEC/clay ratio, and do not have a lithologic discontinuity.  In addition, Holstein soils have 10 percent or less rock fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon."
