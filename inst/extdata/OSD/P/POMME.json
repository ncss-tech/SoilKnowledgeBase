  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Sonora series. Series in similar families are the Britwater and Holstein series.  Sonora soils do not have rock fragments in the upper part of the series control section. The Britwater and Holstein soils have an active CEC/clay ratio, and do not have a lithologic discontinuity.  In addition, Holstein soils have 10 percent or less rock fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on structural benches, strath terraces, and footslopes.  Slopes are 1 to 20 percent.  They formed in a thin mantle of loess or an admixture of loess and colluvium over colluvium or old alluvial sediments.  Some pedons have clayey residuum from limestone, dolostone, or sandstone beneath the sediments below a depth of 50 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 46 inches."

Goss and Sonsac soils are clayey-skeletal and are on steeper sideslope positions adjacent to the Pomme soils.  Dameron soils have a mollic epipedon and are on flood plains below the Pomme soils.  Viraton soils have a fragipan and are on footslopes and ridgetops above the Pomme soils."
