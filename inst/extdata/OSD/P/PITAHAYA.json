    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to hard semi-consolidated limestone ranges from 5 to 20 inches.  Depth to hard unweathered limestone bedrock ranges from 20 to 30 inches.  Reaction is moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.   Content of rock fragments range from 5 to 60 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Content of rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Content of rock fragments range from 25 to 50 percent, by volume.  Texture is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of hard semi-consolidated fractured limestone and has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools, and is rippable by mechanized equipment.\nThe R layer is composed of hard consolidated limestone bedrock."

Slopes range from 5 to 90 percent.  They formed in material that weathered from limestone bedrock.  The climate is tropical semiarid.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 36 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 78 to 82 degrees F."

Costa (T) soils are on similar positions, are shallow to soft weathered limestone bedrock, and have clayey, carbonatic control sections.  Esteli (T) soils are on similar positions, are deep to limestone bedrock, and have coarse-loamy, carbonatic control sections.  Guayacan (T) soils are on similar to lower positions, are very deep, and have fine-loamy, mixed control sections.  La Covana (T) soils are on similar positions, are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon, and have clayey-skeletal, carbonatic control sections."
