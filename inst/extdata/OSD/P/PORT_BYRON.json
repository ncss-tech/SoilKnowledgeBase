The Annieville, Dinsmore, Exira, Galva, Marshall, Salix soils contain more clay in the B horizon.  Biggsville soils contain redoximorphic features in the middle part of the control section.  Keg, Raddle, and Truman soils are formed in alluvium and have an irregular decrease in clay with increasing depth. Monona, Ponca, Salix soils have thinner sola.  Northboro soils are formed in loess, and the underlying erosional sediments tend to have a redder hue and more sand in the lower part of the solum."

Port Byron soils typically formed in thick loess. Some pedons are underlain by sand and a sandy substratum phase is recognized. The mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 12.2 degrees C (43 to 54 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation varies from 710 to 940 mm (28 to 37 inches). Frost free days range from 120 to 160 days."

Carroll and Seaton soils have an argillic horizon and do not have a mollic epipedon.  Tama soils have an argillic horizon.  Joy soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at 31 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet)."
