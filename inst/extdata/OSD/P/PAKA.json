  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum typically is 25 to 45 inches and ranges from 20 to 38 inches.  Depth to siltstone bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  Free carbonates, either disseminated throughout the soil mass or as concretions, are typically at depths of 18 to 25 inches and range from 16 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5 and 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It commonly is loam and less commonly silt loam, silty clay loam, fine sandy loam, and sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 through 7; and 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam and averages between 24 and 35 percent clay. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 5 through 7; and 4 through 6 moist; and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam or loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 7 or 8; and 5 through 7 moist; and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is silty clay loam, silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 7 or 8 and 6 or 7 moist; and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Agar, Eakin, Fairlo, Highmore, Holdrege, Monticello, and Northdale series.  Agar and Holdrege soils formed in silty loess.  In addition, the Holdrege soils do not occur over siltstone, and are free of carbonates to a greater depth.  Eakin soils formed in a silty mantle overlying glacial till within a depth of 19 to 30 inches.  Fairlo soils have clayey textures within a depth of 40 inches.  Highmore soils have mottles in the lower part and have formed in silty glacial drift.  Monticello and Northdale soils have redder hue.   In addition, the Northdale soils are formed mainly from the mantling sediments, but in part from weathered sandstone and Monticello soils are in a drier climate."

Mean annual temperature is about 47 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 20 to 24 inches."

Anselmo and Dunday soils are coarser textured and formed in sandy and loamy sediments.  They occur generally above Paka soils.  Boyd and Labu soils have finer textures and are formed in Pierre shale on lower side slopes; Gavins soils have weathered siltstone within depths of 20 inches and occur in similar positions as Paka soils.  Meadin and O'Neill soils have gravelly sand underlying materials and are higher on the landscape. Onita and Reliance soils formed in loess, have fine textured subsoils and are higher on the landscape.  They occur above Paka soils."
