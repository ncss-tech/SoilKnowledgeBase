  "OVERVIEW": "The Pipp series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on mountains.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from andesite with an influence of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 12 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 46 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 40 and 60 inches.  Hue is 7.5YR or 10YR.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and may include the upper Bw horizon.

Phosphate retention is 30 to 65 percent and acid oxalate aluminum plus 1/2 iron is between 0.5 and 1.5 percent in the less than 2.0 mm fraction.  There is 30 to 50 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregate in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction.  Pipp soils have a moist bulk density of 0.80 to 0.90 g/cc.  It is moderately to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.   It has 10 to 40 percent stones, 5 to 40 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent gravel.  Texture is very stony sandy loam or very cobbly sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.
