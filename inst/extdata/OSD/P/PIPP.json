    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60  consecutive days within the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 46 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 40 and 60 inches.  Hue is 7.5YR or 10YR.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and may include the upper Bw horizon.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 80 percent rock fragments and 10 to 18 percent field estimated clay content.  Phosphate retention is 30 to 65 percent and acid oxalate aluminum plus 1/2 iron is between 0.5 and 1.5 percent in the less than 2.0 mm fraction.  There is 30 to 50 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregate in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction.  Pipp soils have a moist bulk density of 0.80 to 0.90 g/cc.  It is moderately to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.   It has 10 to 40 percent stones, 5 to 40 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent gravel.  Texture is very stony sandy loam or very cobbly sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has 30 to 50 percent stones, 10 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent gravel."

Fryrear soils are 20 to 40 inches to basalt bedrock, are dry for 90 to 110 consecutive days following the summer solstice, and contain pumice in the PSCS.  Yapoah soils are dry for 60 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice, have a solum depth of 10 to 15 inches, and are loamy sand throughout with field estimated clay content of 2 to 8 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pipp soils are on strongly sloping to very steep side slopes of mountains.  Elevations range from 2200 to 4800 feet.  Slopes are 12 to 65 percent.  The soil formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from andesite with an influence of volcanic ash.  The climate is characterized by cold and wet winters and hot and dry summers.   The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 40 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 41 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 100 days."
