  "OVERVIEW": "The Pipestone series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy outwash on outwash plains, lake plains, beach ridges, and water-worked till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
