    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is more than 80 inches. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid in the A horizon; slightly acid to very strongly acid in the E and BE horizons; medium acid to very strongly acid in the Bt horizons; and strongly acid to extremely acid in the BC or C horizons.\nCoarse fragments range from 15 to 60 percent by volume in the A, E, and BE horizons; 35 to 60 percent in the upper Bt horizon(s); and 35 to 80 percent in the lower Bt horizons; and 60 to 80 percent in the BC or C horizons. In some pedons, the lower Bt, BC and C horizons consist of gravels and cobbles of sandstone and/or chert and novaculite that are weakly to strongly cemented by iron, gypsum, calcite, dried clay binder, or a tuffaceous material. Typically, the cementation is a yellowish color in the tuffaceous material and red or brown in the other materials. This cementation can occur in layers of varying thicknesses and, in some pedons, there is horizon stratification with strongly contrasting particle and fragment sizes.\nA  horizon:\nHue:   of 10YR\nValue:  3 or 4\nChroma:  2 to 4\nTexture:  very gravelly fine sandy loam.\nE horizon:\nHue:  10YR\nValue:  4, 5, or 6\nChroma:  3 or 4\nTexture:  gravelly fine sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, gravelly loam, gravelly loamy sand, gravelly silt loam (rare) or their very gravelly analogs.\nBE horizon (where present):\nHue:  7.5YR or 10YR\nValue:  5\nChroma:  6 or 8\nTexture:  gravelly fine sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, gravelly loam, gravelly loamy sand, gravelly silt loam (rare), or their very gravelly analogs.\nUpper Bt horizon(s):\nHue:  7.5YR, 5YR, or 10YR,\nValue:  4, 5, or 6\nChroma:  6 or 8\nor Hue:  2.5YR\nValue:  4 or 5\nChroma:  6 or 8.\nTexture:  very gravelly loam, very gravelly clay loam, very gravelly sandy clay loam, very gravelly sandy loam, or very gravelly silt loam (rare).\nLower Bt horizon(s):\nSame colors as the upper Bt horizons .
