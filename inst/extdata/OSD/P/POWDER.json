    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are continuously dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 90 to 120 consecutive days following the summer solstice (aridic soil moisture regime).  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The particle-size control section has 10 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  The mollic epipedon and solum is 20 to 32 inches thick and is calcareous in some part.  The organic matter content decreases irregularly with increasing depth.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is silt loam or loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe B horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silt loam, loam,  fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam  It has weak medium and coarse prismatic and weak or moderately fine to coarse subangular blocky structure.  It is neutral to moderately aklaline.\nThe C horizon is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam to a depth of 40 inches or more.  It has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Below 40 inches chroma ranges to 1.  Redox concentrations and the 2C horizon is absent in some pedons."
