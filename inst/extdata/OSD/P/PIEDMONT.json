  "OVERVIEW": "The Piedmont series consists of moderately deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in material weathered from clayey and silty shale of Permian age.  These very gently sloping to gently sloping soils are on convex ridges, side slopes and foot slopes of prairie uplands in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA-80A).  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 32 inches and mean annual temperature is 61 degrees F.",

The Dilworth soils have control section of 10YR to 5Y and were developed from gray shale bedrock. The Renthin soils have solum 40 to 60 inches thick over bedrock. The Westsum and Wetbeth soils are very deep. In addition Wetbeth soils developed in alluvium."

Renthin soils occur on similar landscapes, but at higher elevations and are 40 to 60 inches deep. Bethany, Kirkland, and Renfrow soils on higher positions and Norge soils on lower positions have a solum more than 60 inches thick. Also, they have an argillic horizon that does not decrease in clay content from the maximum by more than 20 percent at a depth of 60 inches.  In addition, Bethany and Kirkland soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches  thick and Norge soils have a fine-silty control section.  Grainola soils on lower positions do not have a mollic epipedon and are calcareous. Grant and Kingfisher soils on similar landscapes have a fine-silty control section.  In addition, Grant soils have a solum 40 to 60 inches thick.  Huska soils on similar landscapes, do not have a mollic epipedon and have a natric horizon.  Lucien soils on similar positions have a solum 10 to 20 inches thick and have a loamy control section.  Zaneis soils on higher positions, have a fine-loamy control section, solum 40 to 60 inches thick, and do not have secondary calcium carbonate accumulations."
