Some pedons have streaks or rounded splotches in hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The shale is calcareous in most pedons, but some are only calcareous in seams or fractures.  Electrical conductivity of the saturation extract ranges from 0 to 8 mmhos/cm.  Sodium adsorption ratio ranges from 0 to 16.  This material is non paralithic with low to moderate excavation difficulty. Fractures are greater than 10 cm apart.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Brewer, Brewless, Dilworth, Renthin, Westsum and Wetbeth series.  The Brewer and Brewless soils are very deep and are on flood plains. The Dilworth soils have control section of 10YR to 5Y and were developed from gray shale bedrock. The Renthin soils have solum 40 to 60 inches thick over bedrock. The Westsum and Wetbeth soils are very deep. In addition Wetbeth soils developed in alluvium."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Piedmont soils are on very gently sloping to gently sloping broad and smooth convex ridges, side slopes and foot slopes of uplands in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA-80A).  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in material weathered from clayey and silty shale of Permian age.  The climate is dry or moist subhumid. The mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 38 inches. The Thornthwaite annual PE indices range from 44 to 64. The frost free period ranges from 200 to 230 days. Elevation ranges from 700 to 1600 feet."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bethany, Grainola, Grant, Huska, Kingfisher, Kirkland, Lucien, Norge, Renfrow, Renthin, and Zaneis series.  Renthin soils occur on similar landscapes, but at higher elevations and are 40 to 60 inches deep. Bethany, Kirkland, and Renfrow soils on higher positions and Norge soils on lower positions have a solum more than 60 inches thick. Also, they have an argillic horizon that does not decrease in clay content from the maximum by more than 20 percent at a depth of 60 inches.  In addition, Bethany and Kirkland soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches  thick and Norge soils have a fine-silty control section.  Grainola soils on lower positions do not have a mollic epipedon and are calcareous. Grant and Kingfisher soils on similar landscapes have a fine-silty control section.  In addition, Grant soils have a solum 40 to 60 inches thick.  Huska soils on similar landscapes, do not have a mollic epipedon and have a natric horizon.  Lucien soils on similar positions have a solum 10 to 20 inches thick and have a loamy control section.  Zaneis soils on higher positions, have a fine-loamy control section, solum 40 to 60 inches thick, and do not have secondary calcium carbonate accumulations."
