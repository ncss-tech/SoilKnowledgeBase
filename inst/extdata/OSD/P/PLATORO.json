  "OVERVIEW": "The Platoro series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous medium to moderately fine textured alluvial materials derived mainly frorn basalt and beds of sand and gravel. Platoro goils are on alluvial fans and high terraces and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 62 to 65 degrees F.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent and conductivity ranges from 0 to 14 millimhos within the epipedon and the argillic horizon.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 18 inches.  Depth to the sandy-skeletal IIC horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 10 to 36 inches.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate accumulation ranges from 10 to 40 inches but such horizons are not strong enough to qualify as calcic or gypsic horizons.  The argillic horizon averages 15 to about 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Any C horizon above the sandy-skeletal substratum ranges in clay from 18 to 35 percent and in fine or coarser sand from 15 to 35 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in a major part of the solum and are mainly 1 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction ranges from mildly to moderately alkaline.\nThe C or IIC horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline."

These soils formed in moderately thin, calcareous, medium to moderately fine textured alluvial parent materials derived principally from basalt and overlying beds of sand and gravel.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 43 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F."
