  "OVERVIEW": "The Padres series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium from calcareous sedimentary rocks.  Padres soils are on alluvial fans, alluvial flats and plains and have slopes of 0 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
