Hurley soils are in positions similar to the Promise soils and have a natric horizon.  Opal soils are on higher positions.    Opal soils have bedrock within depths of 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches).  Millboro soils are on similar landscapes as the Promise soils.  Verdel soils have a fine textured control section and are below the Promise soils.  Witten soils are in swales and have a mollic epipedon greater than 50 centimeters (20 inches) thick and are fine-textured."
