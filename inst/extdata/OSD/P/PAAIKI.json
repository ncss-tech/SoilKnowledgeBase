  "OVERVIEW": "The Paaiki series consists of moderately deep well drained soils that formed in material weathered from volcanic ash which overlies hard rock.  Paaiki soils are on uplands and have slopes of 6 to 70 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 50 inches and mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
