  "OVERVIEW": "The Paragon series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from basalt or andesite.  Paragon soils are on plateaus and hillslopes and\nhave slopes of 1 to 35 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches.",

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt and andesite with\nsmall amounts of volcanic ash in the upper part.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 25 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 130 days.  Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent."
