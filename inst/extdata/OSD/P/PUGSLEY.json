  "OVERVIEW": "The Pugsley series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sedimentary rocks.  Pugsley soils are on hills and ridges.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The soil is 80 to 100 percent base-saturated.  Gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent but is usually less than 5 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F. The moisture control section is dry for 60 consecutive days and 90 cumulative days between July 15 and October 25 in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically has granular primary structure but has subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  This horizon is typically light sandy clay loam, but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 5 to 30 percent, and sand from 40 to 75 percent with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."
