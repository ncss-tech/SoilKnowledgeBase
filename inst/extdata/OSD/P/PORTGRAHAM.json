Jakolof soils are more than 40 inches to bedrock and are on stream terraces. Koyuktolik soils are formed in organic matter accumulated in depressions. Kasitsna and Seldovia soils occur on moraines and slopes with thick deposits of glacial till and colluvium. Nanwalek soils are on metastable mountainslopes with thick colluvial deposits. Tutka soils have bedrock within 20 inches and occur on glacially abraded bedrock ridges."
