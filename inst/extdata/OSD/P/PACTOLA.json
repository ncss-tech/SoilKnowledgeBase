    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to consolidated bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  Depth to fractured bedrock containing soil material and with evidence of rock structure is between depths of 20 and 50 inches.  The bedrock is tilted.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 25 to 70 percent by volume the solum and 40 to 80 percent of the C horizon.  Interfingering of the albic horizon into the argillic horizon is in most pedons.  The B/E horizon is part of the argillic horizon.  The control section averages between 27 and 35 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, silt loam, channery loam, or channery silt loam, very channery loam, and very channery silt loam.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Color with value of 3 moist is inherent to the bedrock.  It is silt loam and loam, and contains up to 60 percent channers.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe B/E horizon has colors of the Bt and E horizon.  It is silty clay loam and clay loam and contains 35 to 60 percent channers.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 3 to 5.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam, and contains 35 to 70 percent channers and flagstones.  Content of clay ranges between 27 and 35 percent but some pedons contain up to 40 percent clay in the upper part.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe BC horizon when present has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 5.  It is loam or silt loam and contains 50 to 80 percent flagstones.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 5.  It is loam or silt loam and contains 50 to 80 percent flagstones.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Abreu, Grizzly, Macmeal, Mocmont, Rockoa, Tecolote, Vanocker, Wahatoya, and Yourame series.  Abreu and Macmeal soils do not have a E horizon.  In addition, Abreau soils have igneous pebbles and Macmeal soils have carbonates at depths of 24 to 55 inches.  Grizzly soils contain more clay in the lower part of the argillic (Bt) horizon and have thicker E horizons.  Rockoa soils contain more sand and have coarse fragments of sandstones as stones. Tecolote soils have redder hue in the argillic horizon.  Trapps and Vanocker soils have horizons with accumulations of carbonates. Wahatoya soils contain more sand and have sandstone pebbles and cobbles. Yourame soils have thicker combined E and E/B or B/E horizons."

These soils formed in residuum from metamorphic rocks containing mica.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 26 inches."

The Buska, Grizzly, and Virkula soils are on similar landscapes.  Buska soils contain more mica.  Citadel and Virkula soils contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments of rock.  Heely soils are on similar landscapes and have a mollic epipedon.  Hisega soils typically are on steeper landscapes and do not have argillic horizons."
