  "OVERVIEW": "The Pactola series consists of deep and very deep,well drained soils formed in residuum from steeply dipping beds of metamorphic rock on mountains. They have moderate permeability.  Slopes range from 6 to 60 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F, and the annual precipitation is about 22 inches.",

Content of rock fragments ranges from 25 to 70 percent by volume the solum and 40 to 80 percent of the C horizon.  Interfingering of the albic horizon into the argillic horizon is in most pedons.  The B/E horizon is part of the argillic horizon.  The control section averages between 27 and 35 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, silt loam, channery loam, or channery silt loam, very channery loam, and very channery silt loam.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Color with value of 3 moist is inherent to the bedrock.  It is silt loam and loam, and contains up to 60 percent channers.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe B/E horizon has colors of the Bt and E horizon.  It is silty clay loam and clay loam and contains 35 to 60 percent channers.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 3 to 5.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam, and contains 35 to 70 percent channers and flagstones.  Content of clay ranges between 27 and 35 percent but some pedons contain up to 40 percent clay in the upper part.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe BC horizon when present has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 5.

In addition, Abreau soils have igneous pebbles and Macmeal soils have carbonates at depths of 24 to 55 inches.  Grizzly soils contain more clay in the lower part of the argillic (Bt) horizon and have thicker E horizons.  Rockoa soils contain more sand and have coarse fragments of sandstones as stones. Tecolote soils have redder hue in the argillic horizon.  Trapps and Vanocker soils have horizons with accumulations of carbonates. Wahatoya soils contain more sand and have sandstone pebbles and cobbles. Yourame soils have thicker combined E and E/B or B/E horizons."
