Agustin soils contain 15 to 35 percent gravel in the control section. Filaree, Lostman, and Nasagold soils are in the Mojave Desert (MLRA 30); Pyxo soils are in the Central California Coast Range.  All these soils are dry in some part of the soil moisture control section for more than 20 days cumulative between July and September.  Hayhook and Filaree soils are noncalcareous above 20 inches. Lostman soils contain more than 15 percent coarse fragments in the control section. Sahuarita soils have buried argillic horizons.  Pyxo soils are moderately deep to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Pajarito soils are on upland plains, bajadas, stream terraces and alluvial fans, mostly on convex slopes of 0 to 15 percent, but dominantly 1 to 3 percent. The soils formed in sandy to moderately sandy mixed sediments. Elevations normally range from 3,800 to 5,700 feet and range down to 2,000 feet in parts of Arizona and Texas. The climate is arid to semiarid continental. The average annual precipitation ranges from about 6 to 12 inches with a marked summer maximum. The Thornthwaite PE Index ranges from about 10 to 24. The mean annual air temperature is about 57 degrees to 70 degrees F. The frost-free season is 180 to 240 days.  In Arizona precipitation ranges as high as 13 inches and frost-free season as long as 260 days."
