Jurado and Minnye soils are moist in part of the moisture control section for 10 to 20 days in the summer and are calcareous in the A horizons.  Preatorson soils have a Bt horizon directly over a very gravelly sand substrata at a depth of 25 to 50 cm, have 35 to 75 percent rock fragments throughout all parts of the argillic horizon, and are moist for intermittent periods during the late spring and early summer. Rednik soils have a calcareous argillic horizon that is 15 to 30 percent exchangeable sodium in some part.  Spike soils have Bt horizons with more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium.  Stonell soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Zaba soils have less than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon, a calcareous Bt horizon, and 15 to 35 percent exchangeable sodium in the A and Bt horizons."

Slopes are normally 0 to 15 percent, but range up to 40 percent in Idaho. Elevations are 1,280 to 2,130 meters, and 730 to 1,220 meters in Idaho. Average annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C and the average annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm.  Frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."
