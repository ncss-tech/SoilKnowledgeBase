  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is about 49 to 51 degrees F.  Some or all of the A and C horizons have a bulk density in the fine earth fraction of approximately 0.85 g/cc to 0.95 g/cc.  The organic matter ranges from 25 percent in the surface horizon and decreases with increasing depth to less than 1 percent within 24 to 36 inches of the surface.  The 13- to 40-inch section averages about 25 to 35 percent clay.  The soil is slightly acid to moderately alkaline and reaction does not change appreciably with increasing depth.  Distinct or prominent mottles are present with depths of 20 to 30 inches.  Usually the water table is within 30 inches or less of the surface throughout the year.  The A horizon is very dark gray to gray dry and black or very dark brown moist in hue of 10YR or 2.5Y.  It is mucky silt loam to mucky silty clay in the upper part and silt loam, silty clay loam and clay loam in the lower part. The IIC horizon consists of distinctly or prominently mottled and stratified alluvium containing layers of volcanic ash.  Some layers have thixotropic properties."

James Canyon and Ramelli soils lack ashy layers in the upper 30 inches and have a bulk density greater than 0.95 g/cc in the fine earth fraction.  Likely soils are thixotropic.  Ozamis soils are not dominated by amorphous materials."

They formed in ashy lake sediments mixed with silts in clays and underlain by stratified alluvium.  The climate is cool semiarid.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 20 inches.   Average January temperature is 28 degrees F., average July temperature is 69 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees freeze-free season is 80 to 90 days."
