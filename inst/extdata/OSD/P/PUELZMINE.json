  "OVERVIEW": "The Puelzmine series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt influenced by calcareous loess. Puelzmine soils are on basalt flows. Slope ranges from 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F.",
