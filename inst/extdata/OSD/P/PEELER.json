June and October are usually the driest months.  These soils are thought to be dry in some part of the moisture control section for 45 or more days (cumulative) in normal years. The soil moisture regime is ustic bording on udic.\nMean annual soil temperature: 36 to 42 degrees F.\nMean summer soil temperature: 40  to 44 degrees F\nDepth to the base of the argillic horizon: 17 to 60 inches\nRock fragments average 10 to 35 percent in the 10 to 40 inch section and are mainly 1/8 inch to 10 inches in diameter, and mostly less than 1 inch.  Rock fragments are mostly granite or gneiss with some schist.\nA horizon (if present):\nHue: 7.5YR through 2.5Y\nValue: 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 5 moist\nChroma: 1 through 4\nReaction: moderately acid to neutral.\nE horizon:\nHue: 7.5YR through 2.5Y\nValue: 5 through 8 dry, 3 through 7 moist\nChroma: 1 through 6\nReaction: strongly acid to neutral.\nBt horizon:\nHue: 7.5YR through 2.5Y\nValue: 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist\nChroma: 1 through 6\nTexture: typically sandy clay loam, with gravelly or cobbly modifiers, but averages 18 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 28 percent silt, and 40 to 75 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand\nBase saturation: 60 to 100 percent\nReaction: very strongly acid to neutral.\nBCt horizon:\nHue: 7.5YR through 2.5Y\nValue: 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist\nChroma: 2 through 6\nTexture: sandy clay loam, coarse sandy loam, or sandy loam\nBase saturation: 60 to 100 percent\nReaction is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nC horizon:\nHue: 7.5YR through 2.5Y\nTexture: coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam with gravelly modifiers in some pedons\nReaction: strongly acid to neutral."

(Bt and BCt horizons)\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 3 to 11 inches.  (E horizon)\nAlbic horizon:  The zone from 3 to 11 inches.  (E horizon)\nGlossic horizon:  The zone from 11 to 19 inches.  (E/B horizon)\nArgillic horizon:  The zone from 11 to 43 inches.  (E/B, Bt, and BCt horizons)\nThe series concept was narrowed to better reflect the original concept for the soil.  The series is now defined as having an ustic soil moisture regime; having formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from granite and granitic-gneiss on mountain slopes; and having paramicaceous mineralogy.  The horizon depths were also corrected to recognize the top of the soil surface starting at the Oi horizon.\nClassification changed from Typic Cryoboralf to Glossic Cryoboralfs 1997.\nClassification changed from mixed Glossic Cryoboralfs to paramicaceous Ustic Glossocryalfs 1998.  In 1999 the paramicaceous mineralogy was changed to mixed, superactive.\nTaxonomic version:  Eighth Edition, 1998.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
