  "STATES": "NM,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Penwell series consists of very deep, excessively drained, and rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian deposits of Holocene age. These soils are on very gently sloping to moderately steep hills or dunes. Slope ranges from 1 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in) and the mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
