  "REVDATE": "12/2000",
  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pojo series consists of soils that are moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon. They are well drained soils that formed in eolian and alluvium derived from mixed sources. Permeability is moderately rapid. The soils are on mesas and hillslopes. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F.",
