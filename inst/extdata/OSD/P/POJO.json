Douro soils contain greater than 18 percent clay in the control section and have less organic matter. Hilken soils contain 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section. Jerag and Sharvana soils are less than 20 inches to a petrocalcic horizon. Wickett soils have mean annual soil temperature from 64 to 70 degrees F."
