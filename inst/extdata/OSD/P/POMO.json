    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth of a lithic contact typically is 50 to 60 inches but ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The solum ranges from 21 to 42 inches thick.  The soil profile has 0 to 5 percent coarse and very coarse sand.  The soil between the depth of 7 and 21 inches is moist in all parts between January 1 to April 15.  It is dry in all parts from 75 to 90 days from June 15 to September 15.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 62 degrees F.  Most pedons are neutral throughout but some range to moderately acid in the lower part of the profile.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 5/4; 10YR 5/3 or 5/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/4; 10YR 4/3 or 4/4.  There is usually a thin (1 to 2 inch) surface layer with moist colors of 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.  It is sandy loam or loam and gravel ranges from 1 to 15 percent.  Some pedons lack a BA horizon.\nThe Bt horizon is 7.5YR or 10YR 4/4, 5/4 or 10YR 3/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR or 10YR 3/4, 3/6, 4/4 or 5/4 moist.  It is gravelly loam or gravelly clay loam and has 15 to 35 percent gravel and 2 to 10 percent cobbles.  Base saturation is 75 to 90 percent (sum of cations).  Few thin to common moderately thick clay films are on peds and in pores.  The absolute clay increase from the A to Bt horizon is 3 to 7 percent.  Clay content varies from 25 to 35 percent.\nThe C horizon is gravelly clay or very gravelly clay loam and has 30 to 50 percent clay.  Gravel content ranges from 20 to 60 percent."

Arbuckle soils formed in alluvium, are dry in all parts from 145 days and have a massive and hard surface horizon.  Blasingame, Bressa, Sesame and Tivy soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Borden and Wasioja soils are calcareous in the lower Bt horizon and in the C horizon.  Fallbrook soils have 15 to 28 percent coarse and very coarse sand.  Montpellier soils have more than 15 percent coarse and very coarse sand and have hues of 5YR or 2.5YR in the argillic horizons.  Wyman soils have massive and hard A1 horizons and 7.5YR and 5YR hues in the B2t horizon.  Snelling soils have more than 20 percent coarse and very coarse sand and are dry in the moisture control section for more than 200 days."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pomo soils are on hills and mountains.  They usually occur on south, southeast or southwest facing slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent and are complex because of high frequency of landslips occurring on this soil.  Pomo soils formed in colluvium or material weathered from sandstone, shale, and graywacke.  Elevations are 1,400 to 3,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches.  Mean January temperature is 40 degrees F; mean July temperature is 70 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 56 degrees to 59 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 155 to 200 days."
