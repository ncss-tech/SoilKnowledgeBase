  "OVERVIEW": "The Porkies series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy-skeletal till on bedrock controlled ground moraines and end moraines.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate in the upper part, very slow in the fragic layer, and moderate or moderately rapid in the lower part of the pedon.  Slopes range from 35 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 840 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
