The difference between the mean winter and mean summer soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 17 inches thick. The solum has andic soil properties throughout with moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cubic centimeter, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron of 2 to 4 percent and 15 bar water of 25 to 35 percent on air-dried samples. Acid oxalate iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3. The horizon has 15 to 25 percent coarse fragments. It is very strongly acid or extremely acid.  It has 7 to 25 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6. It is gravelly medial silt loam or gravelly medial silty clay loam. This horizon has 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments. It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.  It has 4 to 10 percent organic matter.\nThe 2Cd horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6. It is dense glacial drift that crushes to very gravelly or extremely gravelly sandy loam or loam. Hard coarse fragments range from 40 to 70 percent by volume."

Elevation ranges from near sea level to 600 feet. Papac soils are in a humid marine climate with relatively cool, dry summers and cool, wet winters. The annual precipitation ranges from 80 to 100 inches. The mean January temperature is 38 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 60 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F. The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 140 to 220 days."
