Depth to redoximorphic features of chroma 2 or less ranges from 16 to 30 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon is brown or dark brown (10YR 3/3, 4/3, 5/3; 7.5YR 4/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), or grayish brown (10YR 5/2).  It is fine sandy loam or loam and ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid, except where limed.\nThe AE horizon is pale brown (10YR 6/3), brown (10YR 4/3, 5/3; 7.5YR 5/4), light brown (7.5YR 6/4), or yellowish brown (10YR 5/4).  It is fine sandy loam or loam and ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid, except where limed.\nThe BE horizon is strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), or brown (7.5YR 5/4).  It is loam, silt loam, or clay loam and is very strongly acid or strongly acid.  Clay content is 25 to 35 percent.  The boundary is gradual or clear and wavy or smooth.\nThe Bt horizon is yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 4/8, 5/6), reddish brown (5YR 4/4), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6), or red (2.5YR 4/6, 5/6).  It is redoximorphic concentrations and depletions in shades of brown, gray, or red and the amount of the redoximorphic features increases as depth increases.  This horizon is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay with the upper 20 inches containing from 35 to 45 percent clay.  It ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid.\nThe BC horizon is red to strong brown with redoximorphic features concentration masses as in the Bt horizon.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  This horizon ranges from moderately acid through mildly alkaline.  Clean sand and silt grains in pockets or on faces of peds comprise from 5 to 15 percent of the volume."

Porum soils formed in a mantle and alluvium.  A perched table occurs at depths of 2 to 3 feet below the surface for brief periods of time during the winter and spring months.  The climate is warm and humid.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches, the mean annual temperature ranges from 57 degrees to 64 degrees F., and the Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 64 to 80."
