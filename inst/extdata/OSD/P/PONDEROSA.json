Depth to layers of continuous carbonates typically range from 15 to 40 inches, but are greater than 60 inches in some pedons.\nThe control section has more than 35 percent very fine sand.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches thick.  In some pedons color value less than 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist extend to depths greater than 20 inches but the organic carbon is less than 0.6 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is very fine sandy loam or loamy very fine sand.  The content of sandstone gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent by volume.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes are dominantly 9 to 45 percent, but range from 3 to 60 percent.  Ponderosa soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from fine grained sandstone.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches."

Busher and Oglala soils are on shoulders and side slopes of uplands and have fine grained sandstone at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Canyon and Tassel soils are on narrow ridge tops and shoulders and are shallow over fine grained sandstone.  Oglala soils are coarse-silty. Vetal soils are in upland swales and on foot slopes and have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  The Ponderosa soil is used mostly for rangeland and woodland.  A few small gently to strongly sloping areas on foot slopes are cultivated to winter wheat alternated with summer fallow, or alfalfa.  Native grasses are mainly blue grama, little bluestem, needleandthread, prairie sandreed, and sand bluestem.  Ponderosa pines and understory shrubs dominate the forested areas and are mostly on north and east facing slopes."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon: Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 12 inches.\nThe Ponderosa series needs additional study.  Climatic data from Harrison, NE indicate the Ponderosa series are in a borderline mesic/frigid temperature regime.  Additional soil moisture and temperature data is needed to properly classify these soils on the steep and very steep slopes in the Pine Ridge.  Soils on the lower foot slopes may be warmer and drier and possibly better included in other soil series.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  National Soil Survey Laboratory data is available for pedon S89NE-161-001.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
