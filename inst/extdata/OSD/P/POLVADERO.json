Casaga soils (MLRA 30), on erosional fan remnants, have mean annual precipitation of 4 to 6 inches, with some precipitation during summer and have 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in 2Bk and 2By horizons. Garces soils (MLRA 17), on fan remnants, formed in granitic alluvium and do not have a calcic horizon. Leuhman soils (MLRA 30), on alluvial flats in lacustrine sediments with influence from eolian materials, are moderately well drained and do not have a calcic horizon. Norob soils (MLRA 30), on alluvial plains and alluvial flats in the Mojave Desert, are moderately well drained and do not have a calcic horizon. Tipnat soils (MLRA 30), on alluvial flats in mixed alluvium from volcanic sources, do not have a calcic horizon."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 12 inches (Ap, A horizons)\n2.  Natric horizon - the zone from 12 inches to a depth of 52 inches (Btkn horizon)\n3.  Calcic horizon - the zone from 12 inches to a depth of 30 inches (Btkn1 horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA: The Ap and Btkn1 horizons in the typical pedon, sample numbers S82CA019-001 (837802) and S82CA019-002 (837803) have some data determined by the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska. According to notes from the NSSL, these samples did not disperse well in their particle size analysis. That is an unexpected result for a soil with a natric horizon. Some cementation may have been inherited from the parent material or may result from carbonates. This data is not currently available through the NSSC website.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
