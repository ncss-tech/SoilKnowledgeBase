  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 34 to 38 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature ranges from 40 to 50 degrees F.  Typically these soils are noncalcareous throughout.  Depth to the basalt bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.   The particle-size control section has 18 to 27 percent clay, 25 to 50 percent silt and 30 to 60 percent sand.  Rock fragments on a weighted basis in the particle-size control section range from 10 to 35 percent, are 1/8 to 3 inches in diameter and increase with depth.  The soil ranges from slightly acid through strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe Bw horizon has color and texture similar to the A horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, 2 through 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Archabal (ID) and Domo (CO) soils.  Archabal soils lack bedrock above depths of 40 inches and are developed on acid igneous rocks and minor amounts of basic igneous rocks.  In addition, they have a thicker solum.  The Domo soils lack hard bedrock above a depth of 40 inches."

These soils formed in residuum and alluvium of basaltic materials.  Mean annual precipitation is 28 to 35 inches the majority of which comes as snow.  Mean annual temperature is 34 to 38 degrees F."

Angostura and Grenadier are forested, have ochric epipedons and Angostura soils have argillic horizons.  Causewa soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections and Domo soils have bedrock at depths greater than 40 inches."
