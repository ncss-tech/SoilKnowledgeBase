  "OVERVIEW": "The Peacham series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in organic material over loamy lodgment till in glaciated uplands and lowlands. They are shallow to a dense substratum and very deep to bedrock. Estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum and moderately low or low in the dense substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1180 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the mineral solum ranges from 11 to 50 cm. Depth to bedrock is greater than 165 cm. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. The weighted average of clay in the particle-size control section is 1 to 10 percent. Rock fragments are mostly gravel and cobbles and range from 5 to 30 percent in the mineral horizons. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral throughout the soil.\nThe O horizon is neutral or has hue of 5YR to l0YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is mucky peat or muck.\nSome pedons have an Oi horizon that consists of peat.\nSome pedons have an A horizon that has hue of l0YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of l or 2. Mucky mineral texture modifiers are common.\nThe Bg horizon, and Eg horizon where present, is neutral or has hue of l0YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.\nThe Cdg horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5Y to 5B, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is massive or has plates of geogenic origin. Consistence is firm or very firm.\nSome pedons have thin sandy lenses in the Bg and Cdg horizons.\nSome pedons have a thin, friable Cg horizon above the Cdg horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Peacham soils are on nearly level to gently sloping areas in glaciated uplands and lowlands. They are typically in open and closed depressions on footslopes and toeslopes. The soils formed in organic material 20 to 40 cm thick and the underlying loamy lodgment till. The till is Wisconsin-aged and derived mainly from granite, gneiss, schist, and phyllite. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 790 to 1640 mm, and the mean annual temperature is 2 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free period ranges from 70 to 135 days. Elevation ranges from about 100 to 800 meters above sea level."

Peacham soils are in a drainage sequence with the well drained Marlow soils, moderately well drained Buckland and Peru soils, somewhat poorly drained Colonel soils, and poorly drained Brayton, Cabot, and Pillsbury soils. Tunbridge and Vershire soils are on higher positions in the landscape and are well drained and moderately deep to bedrock. Wonsqueak soils formed in thicker deposits of organic material over mineral soil material."
