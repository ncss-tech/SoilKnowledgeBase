  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Preble series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks and lake sediments with a component of pyroclastic materials.  Preble soils are on basin floor remnants, alluvial flats and alluvial flat remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

The Durorthidic feature is not recognized with Oxyaquic in the 1992 edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy, but it is required for the series."
