  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks and lake sediments with a component of pyroclastic materials.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 1,220 to 1,525 meters.  The climate is cool, arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 180 to 230 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."

The Durorthidic feature is not recognized with Oxyaquic in the 1992 edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy, but it is required for the series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
