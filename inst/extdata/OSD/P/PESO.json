  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Peso soils are on strongly sloping to very steeply sloping and rolling mountains at elevations of 7,200 to 9,000 feet.  The parent material is weathered mostly from limestone, siltstone, and limy soft shales.  Peso soils occur in a dry subhumid climate.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 to 24 inches with a summer maximum.  The average annual temperature is 37 to 45 degrees F.  The Thornthwaite P-E Index is about 30 to 45."
