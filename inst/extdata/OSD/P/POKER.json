  "OVERVIEW": "The Poker series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material that weathered from sandstone. Poker soils are on hills and ridges and have slopes of 2 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon and the solum range from 16 to 40 inches thick, and depth to sandstone bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Organic carbon ranges from .8 to 3 percent in the mollic epipedon and decreases uniformly as depth increases. The soil is 80 to 100 percent base saturated. Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent but are typically less than 10 percent. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 40 to 58 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It usually has crumb or granular structure but has subangular blocky or prismatic structure in its lower part in some pedons. This horizon is soft or slightly hard and slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline. This horizon usually has prismatic structure but has subangular blocky structure in some pedons. It is typically sandy loam but clay ranges from 8 to 18 percent, silt from 10 to 35 percent, and sand from 50 to 75 percent with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand."

These soils formed in moderately coarse textured parent materials weathered residually from noncalcareous reddish brown sandstone. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 20 inches, approximately 14 inches of which fall during April through September. The average annual temperature is 36 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is 55 degrees F. The frost-free season is 60 to 65 days but frost may occur in any summer month."
