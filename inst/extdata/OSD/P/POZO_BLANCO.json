  "OVERVIEW": "The Pozo Blanco series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on uplands and low hills of the Semiarid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  They formed in alluvium and colluvium over residuum that derived from soft limestone.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 80 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.",

The concept of the Pozo Blanco soils is on Ustic Soil Moisture Regime.\nPozo Blanco soils are in MLRA 271.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
