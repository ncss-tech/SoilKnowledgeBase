Concentration of masses of calcium carbonate range from none to few in the Ap and Bw horizons and from common to many in the Bk horizons.  Concretions of calcium carbonate range from few to common in the C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Content of pebbles is less than 15 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Content of pebbles range from 5 to 20 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5 YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Content of pebbles range from 2 to 25 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Content of pebbles range from 5 to 50 percent, by volume.  Texture is sandy loam, loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction."

They formed in alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from soft limestone.  The climate is tropical semiarid.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 66 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 75 to 79 degrees F."

Aguilita soils are in coarse-loamy family and have carbonatic mineralogy. Cortada, Fraternidad and San Anton soils are very deep on lower lying landscapes.  In addition, Cortada and Fraternidad soils have smectitic mineralogy.  Descalabrado soils are shallow to basic volcanic bedrock.  Duey and San German soils are shallow to limestone bedrock.  Jacana soils are moderately deep to basic volcanic bedrock and have vertic properties."

The concept of the Pozo Blanco soils is on Ustic Soil Moisture Regime.\nPozo Blanco soils are in MLRA 271.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
