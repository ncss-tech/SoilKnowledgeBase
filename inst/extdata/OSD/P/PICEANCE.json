  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision updates the classification from a Borollic Camborthid to be compatible with the 1994 revisions to Soil Taxonomy.  It adds frigid to the family.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized are:  mollic colors from 0 to 4 inches; a cambic horizon from 4 to 22 inches; visible carbonates in the Bk horizon; a lithic contact at 30 inches; an ustic aridic moisture regime; and a frigid temperature regime.  Last updated by the state 4/95.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Lakewood MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
