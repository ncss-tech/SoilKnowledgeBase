  "OVERVIEW": "The Pensore series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from limestone.  These soils are on bedrock-floored plains, hills, hillslopes, valleys, mesas, and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
