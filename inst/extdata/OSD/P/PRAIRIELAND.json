  "OVERVIEW": "The Prairieland series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of late Pleistocene age. These nearly level soils occur on drainageways on broad flats on coastal plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent but mainly less than 0.5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1524 mm (60 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).",
