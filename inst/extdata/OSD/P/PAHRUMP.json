    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pahrump soils are on lake terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in lacustrine deposits from lake bed and offshore bar sediments derived from limestone. Elevations are 730 to 960 meters (2,400 to 3,150 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, occasionally moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is between 75 to 178 millimeters (3 and 7 inches); mean annual air temperature is between 17 to 18 degrees C. (62 and 65 degrees F.), and frost-free season is about 180 to 240 days."
