  "OVERVIEW": "The Pahrump series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits from lake bed and offshore bar sediments derived from limestone. Pahrump soils are on lake terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C. (64 degrees F.).",
