  "OVERVIEW": "The Pawcatuck series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in herbabceous organic deposits over sandy mineral material. They are in tidal marches subject to inundation by salt water twice daily. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to very high in the organic layers and very high in the underlying mineral sediments. Mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C and mean annual precipitation is about 1143 mm.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the organic deposits ranges from 40 to 130 cm. The soil is strongly acid to slightly alkaline.  In a 1:5 soil to water mixture by volume the electrical conductivity (EC) ranges from 0.0 to 4.5 deciSiemens per meter. Thin layers of silt and very fine sand are common in the organic horizons.\nThe surface tier is neutral or has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 0 to 3. It is typically hemic materials but some pedons have fibric materials. Organic matter content ranges from 20 to 80 percent or more.\nThe subsurface and bottom tiers are neutral or have hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 5 and chroma of 0 to 3. The organic materials are dominantly hemic but some pedons have layers of fibric or sapric materials up to 30 cm thick. Organic matter content ranges from 20 to 90 percent and generally decreases with depth.\nThe C horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5BG, value of 2 to 7 and chroma of 0 to 3. Texture is dominantly loamy sand or sand. Some pedons have finer-textured subhorizons but the weighted average texture class is sandy. Organic matter content ranges from less than 5 percent to 20 percent. The C horizon has 0 to 25 percent gravel. Shell fragments and herbaceous fibers are common."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in salt marsh and provide food and habitat for fish, shell fish and wildfowl. Small scattered areas are in saltgrass hay. The most common grasses are salt meadowgrass, salt water grass and spike grass. Other vegetation includes blackgrass, sea lavender, saltwort, seaside goldenrod, aster, and purple gerardi. In areas where the 1:5 EC by volume is below 1.5 deciSiemens per meter, vegetation consists principally of tall reeds and sedges."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This revision reflects general updating. Pawcatuck soils have been mapped as Tidal marsh, undifferentiated. Some of the Pawcatuck soils were classified and mapped at the Great Group or Subgroup level. Pawcatuck series was originally described as consisting of fibric organic materials. Current procedures for estimating fibers indicate that the materials are dominantly hemic. These soils become extremely acid when drained.\nThe lab and/or field method for total salts in the Typical Pedon is not known but is retained for historical purposes. Total salt content previously reported in the RIC is generally more than 10,000 ppm, but total salt content ranges from 1,000 to 40,000 ppm.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\n1. Histosols - have organic materials that total 40 cm or more between the soil surface and a depth of 50 cm - the zone from a depth of 0 to 117 cm (Oe1,Oe2, and Oe3 horizons).\n2. Sulfidic materials are within 100 cm of the surface. New pedons should include incubation pH measurements to determine if horizons should receive a 'se' subordinate distinction due to sulfate content.\n3. Reaction (pH value) is more than 4.5 throughout the control section.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to publication \"Tidal Marshes of Connecticut and Rhode Island,\" Hill, D. E. and Shearin, A. E., Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 709, Feb. 1970.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
