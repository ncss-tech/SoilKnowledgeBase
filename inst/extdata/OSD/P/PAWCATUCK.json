    "content": "REMARKS: This revision reflects general updating, reformatting, and inclusion of blue carbon data. Pawcatuck soils have been mapped as Tidal marsh, undifferentiated. Some of the Pawcatuck soils were classified and mapped at the Great Group or Subgroup level. Pawcatuck series was originally described as consisting of fibric organic materials. Current procedures for estimating fibers indicate that the materials are dominantly hemic. These soils become extremely acid when drained."
