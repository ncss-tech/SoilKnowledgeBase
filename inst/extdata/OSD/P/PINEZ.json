  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinez series consists of deep over an indurated duripan, well drained soils on fan piedmont remnants. Pinez soils formed in mixed alluvium mainly from quartzite and volcanic tuff with minor components of limestone, dolomite and shale. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm (5 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C. (64 degrees F.).",
