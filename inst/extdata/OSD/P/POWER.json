  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Power soils are on lava flow troughs and buttes on lava plains and shield volcanoes and old stream terraces in valleys.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 2,000 to 4,800 feet.  These soils formed in silty alluvium from loess and weathered valcanic ash over loamy alluvium from igneous materials.  The climate is semi-arid with cool moist winters and hot dry summers.  The frost-free period is 100 to 160 days.  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, including up to 3 feet of snow.  Average annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F."

Chilcott, Owinza, and Lanktree soils have Bt horizons containing more than 35 percent clay, and Chilcott soils have duripans.  Jenness and Lolalita soils lack argillic horizons.  Purdam soils have a weakly expressed duripan above 40 inches.  These soils all occur on landscape positions similar to Power soils."
