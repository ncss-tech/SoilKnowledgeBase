  "OVERVIEW": "The Power series consists of very deep well drained soils on plains and valleys.  They formed in silty alluvium from loess and weathered volcanic ash over loamy alluvium from igneous materials.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

Elevations range from 2,000 to 4,800 feet.  These soils formed in silty alluvium from loess and weathered valcanic ash over loamy alluvium from igneous materials.  The climate is semi-arid with cool moist winters and hot dry summers.  The frost-free period is 100 to 160 days.  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, including up to 3 feet of snow.  Average annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F."

Purdam soils have a weakly expressed duripan above 40 inches.  These soils all occur on landscape positions similar to Power soils."
