  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinacol series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over outwash derived from mixed sources with eolian influence in some pedons.  Pinacol soils are on hillslopes, mesas, and structural benches.  Slopes range from 1 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
