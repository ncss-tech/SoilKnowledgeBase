  "REVDATE": "06/2009",
  "STATES": "MN,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Plainbo series consists of excessively drained soils which are moderately deep to a paralithic contact with sandstone. They formed mostly in water laid or eolian sandy deposits on bedrock controlled outwash plains, sand sheets, and stream terraces. Permeability is rapid in the sandy mantle and moderately slow or moderate in the sandstone. Slopes range from 1 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to the paralithic contact with sandstone range from 20 to 40 inches. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 30 percent in the water laid deposits. Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the residuum. Reaction naturally ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid, but ranges to neutral in the upper horizons where the soil is limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Some pedons have an Ap horizon, with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2. The Ap or A horizon is sand, or loamy sand.\nWhere present, the E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sand or loamy sand.\nThe Bw or BC horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 3 to 6. Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. It is sand or loamy sand or the gravelly analogs. Bw horizons with spodic color have less than 0.6 percent organic carbon.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. Some pedons do not have a 2BC horizon.\nThe 2Cr horizon has colors like the 2BC horizon described above. In some pedons the 2Cr horizon grades to a 2R horizon below 50 inches. Thickness of the 2Cr is more than 10 inches."
