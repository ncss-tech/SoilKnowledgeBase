  "OVERVIEW": "The Powderriver series consists of shallow, well-drained soils on backslopes of mountains.  Powderriver soils formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks mixed with a small amount of volcanic ash. Slopes are 15 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and mean annual temperature about 40 degrees F.",
