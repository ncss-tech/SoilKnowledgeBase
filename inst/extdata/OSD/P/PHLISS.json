Checkett soils have Bt horizons with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR.  Chubard soils have mainly cobbles in the particle-size control section. Cottle soils are noncalcareous throughout the particle-size control section and contain 12 to 18 percent clay. Doorkiss and Richinde soils average more than 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Fortyday and Nevo soils do not contain Btk horizon and are not dominated by channers. Old Camp soils have a noneffervescent matrix. Stewval soils receive appreciable amounts of summer precipitation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Phliss soils are on crests and side slopes of mountains and foothills.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from phyllite, slate and schist with minor amounts of quartzite.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,310 to 2,290 meters.  The climate is cool, semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."
