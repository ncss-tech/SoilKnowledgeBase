  "OVERVIEW": "The Pandoah series is a member of the loamy-skeletal, mixed, frigid family of Calciorthidic Haploxerolls. Typically, Pandoah soils have reddish gray and reddish brown calcareous cobbly and channery light loam a1 horizons, reddish brown moderately calcareous channery light loam C horizons containing more than 35 percent rock fragments, and weak red sandstone bedrock at a depth of 26 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 degrees to 47 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 59 degrees to 66 degrees F. The soils are usually dry and are continuously dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 50 to 70 days during late summer and fall. Sandstone or related bedrock is at depths of 20 to 40 inches. the control section between a depth of 10 inches and the bedrock averages less than 18 percent clay and more than 35 percent rock fragments mainly sandstone.  The rock fragments are angular pebbles, channery fragments, angular cobbles, flagstones or stones. The mollic epipedon and the solum range from 7 to 16 inches thick. The A1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It has moderate or strong granular structure. This horizon is moderately or slightly calcareous but is noncalcareous in the upper few inches in some pedons. The C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 5. It ranges to loamy sand in the lower part. This horizon is moderately or slightly calcareous and mildly or moderately alkaline."

Nielsen soils have argillic horizons and have sandstone bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches. Rito soils have cambic horizons and are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock. Wahtigup soils have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, less than 35 percent rock fragments and no bedrock above a depth of 40 inches."

    "content": "SETTING:  Pandoah soils are on hilly to very steep uplands at elevations if 4,800 to 6,500 feet. Slopes range from 10 to 70 percent but those between 20 and 45 percent are dominant. The soils formed mostly in residuum weathered from reddish noncalcareous or slightly calcareous sandstone, but colluvium and/or loess has influenced the upper part. The climate is semiarid with dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is 11 to 15 inches including 2.5 to 5 feet of snowfall.  Average freeze-free period is 80 to 110 days."
