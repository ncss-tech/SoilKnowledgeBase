  "REVDATE": "01/2007",
  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Peekaboo series consists of moderately deep, excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and eolian sands derived from Navajo sandstone. Peekaboo soils are on dunes on structural benches. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
