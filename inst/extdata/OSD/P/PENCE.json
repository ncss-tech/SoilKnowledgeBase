  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 18 to 36 inches. Thickness of the loamy mantle is 10 to 20 inches.  Volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the loamy mantle. Volume of gravel ranges from 15 to 35 percent in the sandy outwash as a weighted average but ranges from 0 to 65 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout.  Some areas have boulders on the surface and a bouldery phase is recognized.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum, but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part of the solum and from strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, or has neutral hue;  value of 2 to 3; and chroma of 0 to 2. Some pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 1 to 3. Uncoated sand grains are common in the Ap or A horizon.  Texture of the A or Ap is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam but in some places it is loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. Texture  is typically sandy loam, but the range includes loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy sand.\nSome pedons have a Bhs horizon less than 3 inches thick.  It has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.  Texture has texture like the Bhs horizon above.\nSome pedons have a 2Bs horizon with color like the Bs horizon described above.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand or the gravelly analogues of these textures.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 to 8. Texture is sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy fine sand, or the gravelly analogs. Some pedons have strata which are very gravelly or extremely gravelly analogs of these textures and some have strata of gravel.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  Typically, Texture is stratified with layers of sand or coarse sand, or the gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogs.  Some pedons have strata of gravel."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on glacial lake plains, outwash terraces, outwash plains, eskers, and kames within moraines.  Slopes range from 0 to 50 percent. Pence soils formed in a thin mantle of loamy alluvium or eolian deposits and in the underlying sand or stratified sandy outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.   Mean annual temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 70 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 600 to 2000 feet"

The moderately well drained Manitowish soils and the somewhat poorly drained Wormet soils form a drainage sequence with Pence soils.  The well drained Padus soils, the moderately well drained Tipler soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Worcester soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where the loamy mantle is 20 to 40 inches thick.  The excessively drained Sayner and Vilas soils are on landscape positions similar to those of Pence soils where the loamy mantle is absent."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas remain in woodland. Forest vegetation is mixed coniferous and deciduous forest. Timber stands are mostly sugar maple, paper birch, red maple, American basswood, northern red oak, white ash, eastern hemlock, and eastern white pine.  Red pine, aspen, balsam, and yellow birch are also in some stands. Some areas are used for cropland or pastureland.  Common crops are corn, small grains, and hay."
