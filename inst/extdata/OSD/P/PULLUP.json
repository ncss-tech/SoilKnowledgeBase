Depth to the ortstein ranges from 10 to 20 inches and ranges from 7 to 15 inches thick.\nIf an A horizon is present it has a hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or is neutral, value of 2 to 4, and a chroma of 0 to 2.\nThe E horizon has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2.  The A and E horizons are sand or fine sand. Reaction of the A and E horizons range from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4. It is sand or fine sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bsm horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 8.  Greater than 50 percent of the color has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 4. It is sand or fine sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sand or fine sand. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma 4 to 6. It is sand or fine sand. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid."
