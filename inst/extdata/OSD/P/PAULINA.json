Elevations range from 1,220 to 1,525 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 40 to 80 days."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between the soil surface and 46 cm (very shallow and shallow free water occurrence classes) from January to June. Water levels may drop as low as 100 cm between July and December. Cumulative annual duration class is Permanent. Some phases are susceptible to frequent ponding for very long duration during February and March with water up to 15 cm deep. Some phases adjacent to streams are susceptible to frequent flooding for long periods between March and June."
