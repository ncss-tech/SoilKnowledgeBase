  "OVERVIEW": "The Pogal series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and lacustrine deposits derived from limestone and sandstone.  Pogal soils are on mounds on lake plains.  Slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
