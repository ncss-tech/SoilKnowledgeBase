    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pogal soils are on rounded or elongated mounds on lake plains.  The mounds are about 6 to 20 feet high and have short, abrupt sides.  The soils formed in loess and lacustrine deposits derived mainly from limestone and sandstone.  Slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 4,250 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, the mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."
