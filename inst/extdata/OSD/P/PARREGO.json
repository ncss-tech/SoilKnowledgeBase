Base saturation is 50 to 75 percent throughout.\nThe Oi horizon is 1 to 3 inches thick, except where disturbed.\nThe A horizon has a value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 moist and dry. It is 5 to 18 percent field estimated clay content. Total soft rock fragments range from 15 to 30 percent.  It has 50 to 80 percent glass and glass coated aggregate.

All of these soils except for Fugawee and Kyburz are over 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Fugawee soils have base saturation of 35 to 50 percent throughout the subsoil and lack the ash surface mantle.  Kyburz soils lack the ash surface mantle, are slightly to very strongly acid and have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR in the Bt horizon."

They formed in ash over residuum and colluvium and weathered from ash flow tuff. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 25 inches, falling mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 47 degrees F. The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
