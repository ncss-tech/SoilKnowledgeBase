The soil between a depth of 7 to 23 inches is dry, in all parts, from July 1 to October 15, and is moist, in all parts, from January 1 to April 30.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 5/3, 5/4; 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3 or 2.5Y 6/2.  Moist colors are 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4; 10YR 3/3 or 3/4.  Where the colors meet the requirements of a mollic epipedon, the thickness is insufficient. It is loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon is 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 10YR 4/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2 or 2.5Y 6/2.  Moist colors are 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6, 5/6; 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2 or 6/3.

Argonaut soils have a paralithic contact with weathered rock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Contra Costa soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Fancher soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to fractured serpentine rock.  Kilaga soils have a solum 60 to 80 inches thick. Trabuco soils have a solum 40 to 80 inches thick and have formed in weathered basic igneous bedrock."

The mean annual temperature varies from 55 degrees to 59 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation varies from 25 to 35 inches.  The frost-free season is 160 to 200 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Thses soils were thought to be formed on terraces but have subsequently been eroded and dissected to erode the summits of the terrace landform.  Phipps soils that occur on slopes of 2 to 8 percent are probably remnants if these old summits.  If detailed soil surveys were made these summits would be differentiated from the Phipps soils.  Less than 500 acres have been recognized to date.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in January of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This pedon was sampled for the National Soil Survey Laboratory, July 1978.  Pedon number S78CA-003-024, NSSL Pedon Number 459, not published.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
