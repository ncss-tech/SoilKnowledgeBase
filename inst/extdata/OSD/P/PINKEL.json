  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinkel series is a member of the loamy, skeletal, mixed, mesic family of Ruptic Lithic Haplustolls.  Typically, Pinkel soils have brown very cobbly loam A horizons and brown very cobbly sandy clay loam B2 horizons over shale and sandstone.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock within each pedon ranges from 8 to 40 inches with the dominant depth ranging from 20 to 40 inches.  Coarse fragments in the control section range from 35 to 85 percent.  The average annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 59 degrees F.  These soils are dry in some part of the section from 4 to 12 inches less than 1/2 the time the soil temperature is 41 degrees F.  or more.  The driest period occurs between October and June.  The solum is neutral to mildly alkaline and noncalcareous to moderately calcareous.  The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, values are 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It contains 1 to 4 percent organic matter.  The B2 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, to light clay loam containing 18 to 35 percent clay.  The C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma ranging from 2 through 4 dry or moist.  Form of the lime ranges from nonvisible and finely divided to common, fine to medium, soft lime concretions and mycelia and a few thin caliche coatings on the bottom of the fragments in the lower part.  The calcium carbonate equivalent increases with depth with the weighted average in the control section being less than 15 percent."

    "content": "SETTING:  The Pinkel soils occur on strongly to very steeply sloping and rolling hills and mountains at elevations of 5,800 to 6,900 feet.  The parent materials are mainly from sandstone and gray shale.  These soils occur in a semiarid climate.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 to 16 inches with a summer maximum.  The average annual temperature is about 45 to 47 degrees F."
