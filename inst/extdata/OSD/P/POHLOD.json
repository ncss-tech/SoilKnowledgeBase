  "OVERVIEW": "The Pohlod series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum from mixed igneous rock sources.  These soils occur on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 700 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
