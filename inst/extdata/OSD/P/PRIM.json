  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the soil over continuous chalk ranges from 4 to 20 inches.  The chalk has a hardness of less than 3 on Mohs scale and can be dug with a spade.  Limestone fragments cover from 20 to 70 percent of the surface.  They range from 5 to 45 cm in diameter but are usually less than 25 cm. They are hard limestone and are known locally as \"horse-bone rock.\"  The soil is calcareous throughout.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of less than 3.5, and chroma of 3 or less.  Texture is very cobbly loam, very cobbly silty clay loam, or very cobbly clay loam; or their extremely cobbly analogues.  Thickness of the A horizon is 10 inches or less.  Content of limestone fragments range from 35 to 70 percent by volume and range from 2 mm to 30 cm in diameter.  Fine concretions of calcium carbonate range from none to few.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or more, and chroma of 1 through 3.  This horizon may contain a few mottles of yellowish brown or olive yellow. Texture is very cobbly loam, very cobbly sandy loam, or very cobbly clay loam; or their extremely cobbly analogues.  Chalk fragments range from 40 to 90 percent by volume and range from 2 mm to 40 cm in diameter.  Fine concretions of calcium carbonate range from none to common.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 or more, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Texture of the chalk is loam, sandy loam, or clay loam.  Splotches or streaks of yellowish brown, olive yellow, yellow, and pale olive in the chalk range from none to common.  This horizon may be interbedded with layers of harder limestone up to 14 inches thick.  These layers have the same colors as do the chalk but they are more difficult to cut with a spade.  Thickness of continuous chalk or limestone is usually greater than 6 feet.  Structure is usually massive but may be weak platy in some pedons.  Fine calcium carbonate concretions range from none to common."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Prim soils are on outcrops of soft limestone or chalk within the Coastal Plain.  The landscape is dissected, and slopes are mainly 10 to 35 percent, but range from 4 percent on the ridgetops to 40 percent on the steeper side slopes. The outcrops are primarily from the Byram or Marianna formation. Near the type location, the annual precipitation is 56 inches and the mean annual temperature is 64 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Luverne, Bama, and Troup series which form perimeters around the outcrop areas.  Luverne soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section and are acid in reaction.  Bama soils have thick Bt horizons and are acid in reaction.  Troup soils have thick sandy epipedons.  Also associated are Oktibbeha and Watsonia soils.  These soils have acid subsoils."
