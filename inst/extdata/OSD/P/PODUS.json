  "OVERVIEW": "The Podus series consists of shallow, somewhat poorly drained soils on terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from tuff, basalt, diatomite and volcanic ash and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
