  "OVERVIEW": "The Pacon series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and/or slope alluvium over residuum weathered from limestone, sandstone and shale.  Pacon soils are on structural benches.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 centimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C.",
