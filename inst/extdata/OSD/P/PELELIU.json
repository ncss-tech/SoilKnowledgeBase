By volume, it is 25 to 50 percent limestone pebbles, .1 to 3 inches in size; and 25 to 35 percent limestone cobbles, 3 to 10 inches in size.  Reaction in 1:1 water is neutral or mildly alkaline.  This horizon is slightly effervescent or noneffervescent.\nThe B2 horizon has moist color of 7.5YR 3/4, 4/6, or 5/6 or of 10YR 4/4, or 4/6.  It has an apparent field texture of very gravelly or extremely gravelly loam or very cobbly or extremely cobbly loam.  Clay content, as measured by the product of 2.5 times the 15-bar water percentage, is more than 45 percent.  By volume, it is 25 to 50 percent limestone pebbles, .1 to 3 inches in size; and 15 to 35 percent limestone cobbles 3 to 10 inches in size.  Reaction in 1:1 water is neutral or mildly alkaline.  This horizon is slightly effervescent or noneffervescent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

On the extremely steep slopes of high, raised coral islands, these soils occupy small, nearly level pockets between jagged coral limestone rock outcrops.  Elevation ranges from 3 to 567 feet.  The mean annual rainfall is about 114 to 145 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 81 degrees F."
