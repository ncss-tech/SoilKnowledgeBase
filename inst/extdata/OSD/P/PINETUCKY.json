    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to horizon that contains more than 5 percent plinthite is 25 to 60 inches.  Strongly cemented to indurated iron oxide concretions less than 2 cm in diameter range from 0 to 10 percent in the A horizons and 0 to 5 percent in the Bt horizon. CEC ranges from 8 to 15 meq per 10 gm of soil.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The E horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The horizons are fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy fine sand.  Reaction is medium acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma from 4 through 8.  Mottles range from none to many, with hues of 10R to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma from 3 to 8.  The Btv horizons have the same colors as the upper Bt horizons, and in addition, contain few to many mottles with value of 6 or 7, and chroma from 1 to 3.  The Btv horizon contains 5 to 20 percent plinthite in some part.  The texture of the Bt and Btv horizons is sandy clay loam or clay loam throughout, with a clay content ranging from 20 to 35 percent.  Reaction is strongly acid to very strongly acid."

Baxterville soils have Bt horizons that are 5YR and redder.  Bowie soils are on Eocene age landscapes of the upper coastal plains.  Boykin soils have loamy fine sand surface layers 20 to 40 inches thick.  Dothan and Tifton soils have less than 20 percent silt in the control section.  Malbis and Otanya soils have perched water tables at shallower depths.  Notcher and Rogan soils have more than 15 percent ironstone pebbles.

The soils formed in loamy sediments of Pleistocene age, mainly from the Willis formation.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 46 to 58 inches.  Summer rainfall ranges from 30 to 40 inches.  Summer moisture deficit ranges from 0 to 4 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 70 degrees F., and the Thornthwaite annual P-E index exceeds 72."

Bonwier, Urland, and Newco soils occur on ridgetops and low hills in the landscape; they all have clayey control sections.  Boykin soils are on slightly higher areas.  Conroe and Doucette soils are on similar positions and have thicker loamy fine sand surface layers.  Rogan soils occur on gently sloping areas.  Stringtown soils occur on steep side slopes and have a clay content in the Bt horizon that decreases within 60 inches of the surface."
