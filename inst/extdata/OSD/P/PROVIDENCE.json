  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is more than 60 inches. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 18 to 38 inches. The particle-size control section contains 18 to 30 percent clay and from 5 to 15 percent sand. Depth to the discontinuity with more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser material ranges from 24 to 48 inches of the surface. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid, except in areas that have been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 6. In eroded areas, the Ap horizon is a mix of the E and Bt horizons. Texture is silt loam but can range up to silty clay loam in severely eroded areas.\nWhere present, the E horizon has hue, 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Btx and 2Btx horizons either have a matrix with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8 with iron depletions in shades of gray, and masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown, and red, or they are variegated in shades of these colors. Characteristically the fragipan has gray vertical seams that form a roughly polygonal pattern of prisms. The matrix in the prisms between the seams is very firm when dry and brittle when moist, and in the major part, it constitutes more than 60 percent of the volume. The Btx horizon and the upper part of the 2Btx horizon is silty clay loam or silt loam. The lower part of the 2Btx horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam (containing evident amounts of sand), clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or sandy loam. Concretions range from none to many.\nThe 2Bt horizon ranges in color from red to gray and is commonly variegated in these colors. It is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, silt loam or clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Jay and Loring series in the same family, and the Bude, Byram, Calloway, Debute, Dulac, Duralde, Gigger, Grenada, Lax, Leverett, Ora, Paden, and Savannah series in closely related families. Jay soils formed in loamy material overlying siltstone or cherty limestone on uplands in the Ozark Highlands. Byram soils have a slightly acid to moderately alkaline clayey 2C horizon at a depth ranging from 48 to 72 inches. Dulac soils have clay and silty clay 2B horizons underneath the fragipan. Gigger soils do not have a siliceous 2B horizon developed in Coastal Plain sediments. Loring soils have less than 15 percent sand and commonly less than 5 percent in all horizons within a depth of 48 inches from the surface. Bude and Calloway soils have a double clay maxima in the solum, do not have evident clay films in the B horizon, and have iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less in the upper 16 inches of the soil. Debute, Lax, Ora, and Savannah soils have base saturation of less than 35 percent at 30 inches below the top of the fragipan. In addition, Ora and Savannah soils have more than 15 percent fine and coarser sand in the Bt horizon. Lax soils have a gravelly Bx horizon. Duralde and Leverett soils do not have a fragipan and have intrusions of albic materials in the B horizon. Grenada and Paden soils have a double clay maxima in the solum and do not have evident clay films in the upper part of the B horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Providence soils are on nearly level to moderately steep topography in the Southern Coastal Plain (MLRA 133A) and the Southern Mississippi Valley Silty Uplands Major Land Resource Areas. Slopes are dominantly 2 to 8 percent and range from 0 to 15 percent. The soil formed in a mantle of silty materials, about 2 feet thick, and the underlying sandy and loamy sediments. The climate is warm and humid. The mean annual temperature is about 67 degrees Fahrenheit, and the mean annual precipitation is 57.0 inches near the type location."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bude, Loring, and Paden soils listed as competing series and the Lexington, Ruston, and Saffell soils. Somewhat poorly drained Bude soils are on lower lying terrain, and moderately well drained Loring and Paden soils are in similar landscape positions as the Providence soils. Well drained Lexington, Ruston, and Saffell soils do not have a fragipan and mainly are on the more rolling parts of the same landscape, especially the short hillsides and more undulating ridge tops."

The soil has a perched water table at a depth of 1.5 to 3.0 feet during the months of January through March in normal years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of the Providence soils are used for growing corn, soybeans, cotton, small grains, annual legumes, truck crops, and orchards. Some areas are used for hay and pasture. Native vegetation is a mixed pine and hardwood forest. Common trees are loblolly pine, shortleaf pine, Shumard oak, sweetgum, and yellow-poplar."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 7 inches (A and E horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 7 to 60 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btx, 2Btx1, 2Btx2, 2Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons).\nFragipan - the zone from 23 to 53 inches (Btx, 2Btx1 and Btx2 horizons).\nThe Providence series was reclassified from a Typic Fragiudalf to an Oxyaquic Fragiudalf in 2002 based on the depth to saturated zone that it has historically been interpreted with. The type location profile description was updated in 2004 to add additional data from observations in the fragipan, and to extend the description to 80 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data: Characterization data for two pedons are published in SSIR No. 13, pp. 126-129. Physical and chemical data for one pedon are published in Soil Survey of Benton County, Mississippi (issued January 1977) pp. 40-41. Engineering test data for pedons are published in Soil Survey of Covington County, Mississippi (issued February 1965) pp. 52-53. Engineering test data for two pedons are published in Soil Survey of Lincoln County (issued May 1963) pp. 38-39 and Soil Survey of Marshall County, Mississippi (issued July 1972) pp. 42-43, respectively. Physical and chemical data is also available from: The Soil Survey of Rankin County, Mississippi (1987). Pg. 177. Soil Survey of Simpson County, Mississippi (1996). Pg. 144.
