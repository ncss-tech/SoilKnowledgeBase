  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Pyron series was formerly included with the Rowena series. The series was separated based on the absence of vertic features and the presence of an argillic horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 6 to 26 inches. (Bt horizon)\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 15 inches. (A and Bt1 horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 6 to 29 inches. (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon: 29 to 47 inches. (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number S03TX-415-005 from Scurry County, Texas.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL Data from type location S03TX-415-005. Particle-size analysis, calcium carbonate equivalent, sieve analysis and pH tests were performed at the project office on 13 pedons.\nTaxonomic version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
