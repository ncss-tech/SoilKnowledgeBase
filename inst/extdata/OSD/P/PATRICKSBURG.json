    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bartle, Doles, Dubois, Platea, Wadsworth, and Weinbach series. None of these soils have a paralithic contact within the series control section. Bartle soils formed in mixed silty or loamy alluvium and loess on stream terraces. Doles soils formed in loess and silty colluvium or old alluvium on valley fills in abandoned preglacial drainage systems. Dubois soils formed in loess and a palesol from loamy lacustrine sediments on lake plains. Platea and Wadsworth soils formed in Wisconsinan age till on till plains and moraines and have carbonates in the series control section. Weinbach soils formed in old acid alluvium on terraces."

They formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess and in the underlying paleosol in residuum from sandstone, siltstone and shale. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11.1 to 13.9 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free days range from 170 to 200.

In drained areas, the depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table is 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2.0 feet) between December and April in normal years. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) above the fragipan and low to moderately high (0.07 to 1.41 micrometers/s) in and below the fragipan. Permeability is moderate (0.6 to 2 inches per hour) above the fragipan and very slow or slow (0.01 to 0.2 inches per hour) in and below the fragipan. The potential for surface runoff is medium or high."
