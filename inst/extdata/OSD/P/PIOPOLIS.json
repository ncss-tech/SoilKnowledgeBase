  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Piopolis soils are in backswamps of flood plains or flood-plain steps within lake plains. Slope gradients commonly are less than 1 percent, and range from 0 to 2 percent. Piopolis soils formed in silty alluvium. The alluvium is silty clay loam in the upper part. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 965 to 1143 mm (38 to 45 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C (54 to 58 degrees F). Frost- free period is 180 to 200 days. Elevation is 104 to 183 meters (340 to 600 feet) above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Birds, Bonnie, Cape, Jacob, Karnak, Stendal, and Zipp soils. Birds, Bonnie, Cape, and Petrolia soils are in backswamps of flood plains. Bonnie soils contain less clay in the particle-size control section. Cape, Jacob, and Karnak soils contain more clay in the particle-size control section and are typically in backswamps. The somewhat poorly drained Stendal soils are on slightly higher flood-plain steps. The more clayey Zipp soils are on flats and depressions of lake plains."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained or very poorly drained. In undrained conditions, depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 61 cm (2 feet) above the surface to at the surface between November and June in normal years. Where drained, the depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below between December and May in normal years. Potential for surface water runoff is low or negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. Permeability is slow. Flooding from stream overflow is common during late winter and spring."

In most areas these soils have been described as having weak or moderate blocky structure through the middle part of the series control section.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 18 cm (7 inches) (Ap horizon)\nCambic horizon: from a depth of 18 to 94 cm (7 to 37 inches) (Bg1, Bg2, Bg3 horizons)\nAquic conditions: redoximorphic features present in all horizons below the ochric epipedon\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
