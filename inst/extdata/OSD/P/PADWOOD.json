    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon, thickness of the loamy mantle, and depth to sandy outwash all range from 24 to 40 inches. Depth to the stratified lacustrine deposits ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the loamy mantle but typically is less than 15 percent in the upper part.  The volume of gravel in the sandy outwash ranges from 3 to 50 percent as a weighted average, and from 0 to 60 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the loamy mantle and in the sandy outwash.  Rock fragments typically are absent in the lacustrine material.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid below the spodic horizon. Redox accumulations are below the spodic horizon but within 40 inches. Saturation occurs within 40 inches at some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs. It is present in at least 50 percent of each pedon.\nSome pedons have a Bhs horizon less than 3 inches thick with hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.  It has textures like the Bhs horizon above.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon with color and texture like the E horizon described above except in some pedons it is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nPadwood soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both). The E' part has color and texture like the E' horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nSome pedons have a Bt horizon with color and texture like the Bt part described above.  The argillic material averages 8 to 17 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR and value and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, fine sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nSome pedons have a 2BC horizon with color and texture like the 2Bt horizon described above.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It has more than 85 percent sand and is fine sand, sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs. Stratification is common in many pedons.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 5YR 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 6.  It is stratified dominantly with silt, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, or very fine sand, but thin strata of silty clay loam, loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, and fine or medium sand are in most pedons."

Annalake, Goodwit, Newood, and Sarwet soils do not have more than 85 percent sand (sandy outwash) in the series control section.  Peavy soils do not have a glossic horizon.  Shoepac soils have 18 to 30 percent clay in the argillic horizon.   Tipler and Padwet soils have more than 85 percent sand throughout the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Padwood soils are in outwash-veneered areas of stream terraces and glacial lake plains.  They formed dominantly in loamy alluvium and in the underlying sandy outwash which is underlain in turn by stratified loamy and sandy lacustrine deposits.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 90 to 120 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1900 feet."

The somewhat poorly drained Worwood soils are in a drainage sequence with the Padwood soils.  The well drained Padus soils, the moderately well drained Tipler soils, the somewhat poorly drained Worcester soils, and the poorly drained and very poorly drained Minocqua soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where the substratum is sand and gravel to depths of more than 60 inches."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Surface runoff is slow or medium.  Permeability is moderate in the loamy mantle, moderately rapid to very rapid in the sandy outwash, and moderately slow in the stratified loamy and sandy lacustrine material.  Padwood soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 2.5 to 3.5 feet at some time during the period of October to May for 1 month or more per year in 6 or more out of 10 years."
