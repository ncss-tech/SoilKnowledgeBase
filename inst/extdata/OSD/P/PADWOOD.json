  "OVERVIEW": "The Padwood series consists of very deep moderately well drained soils in outwash-veneered areas of outwash terraces and glacial lake plains. They formed dominantly in moderately deep, loamy alluvium underlain by sandy outwash which is underlain in turn by stratified lacustrine deposits.  Permeability is moderate in the loamy alluvium, moderately rapid to very rapid in the sandy outwash, and moderately slow in the stratified loamy and sandy substratum.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon, thickness of the loamy mantle, and depth to sandy outwash all range from 24 to 40 inches. Depth to the stratified lacustrine deposits ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the loamy mantle but typically is less than 15 percent in the upper part.  The volume of gravel in the sandy outwash ranges from 3 to 50 percent as a weighted average, and from 0 to 60 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the loamy mantle and in the sandy outwash.  Rock fragments typically are absent in the lacustrine material.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid below the spodic horizon. Redox accumulations are below the spodic horizon but within 40 inches. Saturation occurs within 40 inches at some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs. It is present in at least 50 percent of each pedon.\nSome pedons have a Bhs horizon less than 3 inches thick with hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.  It has textures like the Bhs horizon above.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon with color and texture like the E horizon described above except in some pedons it is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nPadwood soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both). The E' part has color and texture like the E' horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nSome pedons have a Bt horizon with color and texture like the Bt part described above.  The argillic material averages 8 to 17 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR and value and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, fine sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nSome pedons have a 2BC horizon with color and texture like the 2Bt horizon described above.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It has more than 85 percent sand and is fine sand, sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs. Stratification is common in many pedons.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 5YR 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 6.  It is stratified dominantly with silt, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, or very fine sand, but thin strata of silty clay loam, loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, and fine or medium sand are in most pedons."
