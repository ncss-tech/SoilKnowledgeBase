  "OVERVIEW": "The Purcella series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Purcella soils are on fans, piedmonts, and terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Golondrina, and Romine soils do not have a calcic horizon. Majada soils have a calcic horizon within 40 inches.  Willowman soils are less than 20 inches to the base of the Bt horizons.  Nederland soils have more than 45 percent sand in the particle-size control section. Montoso soils have strongly contrasting layers of cinders between 12 and 32 inches (The concept of Montoso should be reexamined and possibly reclassified as Loamy over pumiceous or cindery). Murdo soils have sola 10 to 20 inches thick over horizons of strongly contrasting sands and gravel (The concept of Murdo should be reexamined and possibly reclassified as Loamy-skeletal over sandy or sandy-skeletal). Irock, Mokiak, and Salas soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact of gneiss or schist bedrock. Jumbopeak soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact of gneiss and schist. Wandurn soils are deep to a lithic contact of monzonite. Wheelerwell soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact of dolomite."
