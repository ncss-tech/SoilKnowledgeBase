The Bairs soils average 10 to 25 percent clay and more than 45 percent sand in the Bt horizon.  The Breko soils have average annual soil temperature above 12.7 degrees C.  Cowgil soils have secondary carbonates in the lower part of the Bt horizon or immediately below.  Drino and Hefed soils average 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have average annual soil temperature of 52 to 55 degrees F.  Hunewill soils average 18 to 27 percent clay in particle-size control section and less than 2 percent clay below 50 cm.  Jungo soils are moderately or strongly alkaline and have secondary carbonates in the Bt horizon.  Lithgow soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 50 to 100 cm.  Stucky soils have more than 45 percent sand in the Bt horizon.  Washoe soils are 80 to 114 cm deep to the base of the Bt horizon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Plush soils are steep on sideslopes of foothills, commonly below cliffs, and on landslide deposits at elevations of 915 to 1,605 meters.  Slopes range from 25 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and slope alluvium from welded rhyolitic tuff and related extrusive rocks.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation is 250 to 330 mm, and average annual temperature is 7.2 to 11.1 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 90 to 135 days."
