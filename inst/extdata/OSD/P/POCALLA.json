The soil ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon and is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout the rest of the profile.  Nodules of plinthite range from common to many in the Btv horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2.  It is sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is sandy loam.\nThe E' horizon or the B/E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is sand or loamy sand.\nThe Btv horizon commonly is mottled in shades of yellow, brown, red, or gray.  Some pedons have a matrix with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8 with mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray.  The Btv horizon is sandy loam or sandy clay loam with more than 5 percent nodules of plinthite."
