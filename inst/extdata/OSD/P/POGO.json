  "OVERVIEW": "The Pogo series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Pogo soils are on flood plains and drainageways.   Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
