  "OVERVIEW": "The Picketpin series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderate permeability that formed in mixed colluvium and alluvium from granitic sediments and silty lacustrine deposits. Slopes range from 25 to 65 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Ahsahka soils have 2Bt horizons with 32 to 50 percent clay and slickensides, and have Oi horizons. Colma soils have mottled B horizons overlying slowly or very slowly permeable C horizons and have a mean annual soil temperature of 55 to 58 degrees F. Canyonspring soils are not currently in the database and cannot be competed. Currymountain, Duzel and Tweedy soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Dragnot, Farrot, Hatspring, Immiant, Lobitos, Mehlhorn and Vollmer soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to lithic contact. Elkheights soils have Cd horizons and are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days. Facey and Taneum soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a lithic contact. Foehlin soils have average annual soil temperatures of 52 to 56 degrees F. and do not have lamellae in the Bt horizon. Ladd soils have high amounts of volcanic ash in the soil surface, do not have lamellae in the argillic horizon and are dry for 80 to 90 consecutive days in the summer. Pittville soils have average annual soil temperatures of 52 to 54 degrees F. Sagaser soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Tieton soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a lithic contact and have calcareous C horizons. Yardarm soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact (schist) and have a MAST of 54 to 59 degrees F."
