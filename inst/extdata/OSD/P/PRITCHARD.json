    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is dry in all parts\nbetween about 4 and 10 inches for 60 to 90 consecutive days\nafter the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature\nis 47 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60\ninches, but may be 40 to 60 inches in some pedons.  Depth to\nthe 2Bt horizon is 10 to 20 inches.  Organic matter content\ndecreases to less than 1 percent at 20 inches.  There is an\nabsolute increase in clay of 20 to 30 percent between the A2\nand 2Bt horizons.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and\nchroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 10 percent\ngravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and\nchroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is clay or silty\nclay.  It is slightly effervescent in most pedons in the\nlower part.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist and dry and chroma\nof 3 or 4 moist and 4 through 6 dry.  It is clay loam or\nsilty clay loam.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 5\npercent cobbles."

The soil formed in colluvium and residuum\nderived dominantly from gabbro.  The climate is\ncharacterized by cold moist winters and warm dry summers.\nThe mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean\nannual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free\nperiod is 110 to 130 days.  The soil is on the geomorphic\nsurface equivalent to the Eola geomorphic surface of the\nWillamette Valley."
