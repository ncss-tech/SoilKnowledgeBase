  "OVERVIEW": "The Pennichuck series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in loamy glacial till underlain by unweathered phyllite.  They are on rolling uplands.  Permeability is moderate. Slope ranges from 3 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 47 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 54 degrees F.",

Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nRock fragment content in the solum is 10 to 50 percent channers and 0 to 15 percent gravel.  Rock fragment content in the C horizon is 30 to 75 channers and 5 to 15 percent flagstones.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral throughout the soil.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  In forested areas, the A horizon may have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 3.  Texture is dominantly fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam, but includes loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction, but some pedons have loamy coarse sand immediately above the bedrock."

Lithology of the till is generally similar to that of the local phyllite bedrock.  The climate is humid temperate.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 47 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 54 degrees F.  The growing season is 130 to 195 days."

Canton soils are on similar landforms but have contrasting textures and are very deep.  Hinckley and Hoosic soils are on nearby glaciofluvial landforms, are underlain by stratified sand and gravel and are very deep. Hollis soils are shallow and are somewhat excessively drained.  Bernardston soils are on similar landforms, are underlain by dense till and are very deep to bedrock."
