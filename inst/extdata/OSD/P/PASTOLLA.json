  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nThe series was formerly classified as medial over loamy, mixed, mesic Histic Endoaquands.  It was reclassified due to additional laboratory data.  It was changed to the current classification because the Fe and Al oxalate values were very low and did not meet the andic soil properties for andisols or an andic subgroup.  It did not have an Ap horizon and therefore did not meet the organic carbon and clay requirements for a histic epipedon.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This pedon was characterized by the NSSL in 1984.  Pedon number is S 84CA-089-002 unpublished.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.
