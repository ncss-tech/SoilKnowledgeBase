  "OVERVIEW": "The Peeksville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils which are moderately deep to a densic contact. These soils formed in loamy alluvium and in loamy till underlain by dense loamy and mostly sandy lodgement till on drumlins. Permeability is moderate in the loamy alluvium, moderate or moderately slow in the loamy till, and slow in the dense till. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the dense sandy or loamy till ranges from 24 to 40 inches. Content of clay averages from 3 to 7 percent in the particle-size control section and the content of sand coarser than very fine averages 35 to 70 percent. Coarse fragments are dominantly of igneous origin and are of mixed lithology. Total volume of rock fragment ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the loamy alluvium, 0 to 25 percent in the loamy till, and 5 to 35 percent in the dense till. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the loamy alluvium and 5 to 25 percent in the loamy till and from 5 to 30 percent in the dense till. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 7 percent and volume of stones ranges from 0 to 3 percent throughout. Surface stones have coverage ranging from 0 to 3 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the loamy alluvium and loamy till and from strongly acid to slightly acid in the dense till. Redoximorphic features and aquic conditions occur within 20 inches of the mineral soil surface in the albic or spodic horizons.\nA horizon\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 2 or 3\nChroma: 1 or 2\nTexture: fine sandy loam\nCultivated pedons have an Ap horizon\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 2 or 3\nChroma: 1 or 2\nTexture: fine sandy loam\nE horizon\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 4 or 5\nChroma: 2 or 3\n(Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 6 or more)\nTexture: fine sandy loam or sandy loam\nBs horizon\nHue: 7.5YR\nValue: 3 to 5\nChroma: 4\nTexture: fine sandy loam or sandy loam\nPeeksville soils have a glossic horizon.  Horizonation has a wide range depending on the thickness of the loamy alluvium and degree to which eluviation has occurred.  Therefore, there can be E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons singularly or in combination.  The E part of the E/B or B/E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value, dry of 7 or more. The Bt part of the E/B or B/E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  The E part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizons has colors similar to the E described above.  The Bt part has colors similar to those of the 2Bt horizon described below.  Texture for the 2E/B or 2B/E is sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam. Bulk density ranges from 1.65 to 1.80 gm/cc in the glossic. The B/E or 2B/E horizon does not have the clay increase to meet the requirements for an argillic horizon.\n2Bt horizon\nHue: 5YR or 7.5YR\nValue: 4 or 5\nChroma: 3 or 4\nTexture: sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam\n2BCd horizon\nHue: 5YR or 7.5YR\nValue: 4\nChroma: 3 or 4\nTexture: sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam\nMoist bulk density--1.80 to 2.00 gm/cc\n3BCd and 3Cd horizons\nHue: 5YR or 7.5YR\nValue: 4\nChroma: 3 or 4\nTexture: predominantly loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand, but some pedons have sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam textures\nClay content in the dense till--2 to 7 percent\nMoist bulk density--1.85 to 2.00 gm/cc"
