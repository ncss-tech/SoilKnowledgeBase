  "OVERVIEW": "The Panthercreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in debris flow colluvium derived from schist. Panthercreek soils are on stabilized debris slides on mountains and have slopes of 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2030 millimeters (80 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
