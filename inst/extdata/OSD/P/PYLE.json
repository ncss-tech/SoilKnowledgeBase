  "OVERVIEW": "The Pyle series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from granodiorite, quartz monzonite, quartz diorite and other related rocks. These soils are on mountain slopes and ridges. Slopes are 5 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 750 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C.",
