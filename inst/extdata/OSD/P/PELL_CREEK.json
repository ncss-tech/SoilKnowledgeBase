This structure is evident in pits and cutbanks and rarely observed by smaller scale investigations. The change in moist bulk density of 1.45 to 1.65 g/cc was based on lab data of soils that are similar and field investigations by soil scientist in this geomorphic landform of the Coteau des Prairies bench\".\nBased on current investigations, elevation range in MLRA 103 is about 270 to 480 meters above sea level. However, the elevation data in the 2006 issue of USDA Handbook 296, has not been changed to agree with this elevation data.\nCation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
