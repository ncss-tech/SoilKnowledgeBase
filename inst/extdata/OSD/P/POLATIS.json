  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The soils were classified formerly as Sierozems and later as Xerollic Calciorthids. The previous official series description states that some pedons have an SAR of up to 30. Those pedons with high sodium accumulations would now classify as Sodic Xeric Haplocalcids. There are also many pedons mapped as Polatis that contain 20 percent or more firm or very firm nodules. These pedons would now classify as Petronodic Haplocalcids. Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon\nCalcic horizon - the zone from 7 to 28 inches (Bk1, Bk2 and Bk3 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 28 inches (part of the Bk1, the Bk2 and the Bk3 horizons)."
