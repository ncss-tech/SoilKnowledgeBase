  "OVERVIEW": "The Pleasant series consists of very deep, well to moderately well drained soils that formed in thick, noncalcareous, silty to clayey materials derived as local alluvium from eolian deposits, silty sedimentary rocks or adjacent soils.  Pleasant soils are on drains, depressions on uplands and fans, and outwash pediments.  Slopes are about 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 41 centimeters (16 inches) and means annual temperature is 10 degrees C. (49 degrees F.) at the type location.",
