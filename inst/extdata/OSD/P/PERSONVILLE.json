The lower boundary of the solum rests abruptly on limestone bedrock or grades into bedded limestone.  Clay content in the particle-size control section ranges from 18 to 25 percent.  Siliceous pebbles range from 0 to 5 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.  The E horizon, when present, is one or two units of value more than the A horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Mottles are in shades of red, yellow, or brown.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral. Fragments of limestone range from 0 to 5 percent just above the limestone bedrock. Black concretions range from none to few.\nThe 2R layer is hard limestone bedrock that is tightly fractured.  Fossils range from few to common.  Hardness is more than 3 on Moh`s  scale."

Cisco, Gholson, and May soils do not have a lithic contact of limestone.  Lavender soils have a lithic contact of limestone at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Gasil soils lack a lithic contact.  Groesbeck soils have a mollic epipedon.  Rosanky soils have a fine control section.  Silawa soils have a redder hue in the Bt horizons.  Styx soils have a solum of 60 to more than 80 inches."

These soils formed in loamy Pleistocene sediments deposited over the Tehuacana Limestone, mainly of the Midway Group of Tertiary age.  Slope gradients are mainly between 1 and 3 percent but range up to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 38 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 67 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 250 to 260 and elevation ranges from 430 to 650 feet.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 56 to 64."

The Axtell and Gredge soils have fine textured argillic horizons and are in similar positions.  The Groesbeck soils have a mollic epipedon and a solum thickness of 20 to 40 inches over limestone.  The Lavender and Silawa soils have redder hues in the Bt horizons and Lavender soils have a solum thickness of 20 to 40 inches over hard limestone.  Padina soils have a sandy surface greater than 40 inches thick.  Rader soils are in concave positions and have gray mottles due to wetness.  Styx soils have a sandy surface layer 20 to 40 inches thick."
