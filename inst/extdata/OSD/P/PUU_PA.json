The soils are on all hillslope positions of undulating to hilly ash fields and `a`a flows that are 65,000 to 250,000 years old.  A small extent of Puu Pa soils occur on steep cinder cones. Slope gradients range from 6 to 20 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash in `a`a lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 510 to 1270 millimeters (20 to 50 inches) with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1780 to 2030 millimeters (70 to 80 inches). The mean annual air temperature ranges from 15 to 22 degrees C (60 to 71 degrees F). The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
