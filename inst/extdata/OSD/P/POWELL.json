The soils are usually moist but are dry throughout between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days during the period of 120 days following the summer solstice.  Depth to the fragipan is 15 to 24 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 7 to 9 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has few faint and distinct redox concentrations at depths between 12 inches and the fragipan.  This horizon is silt loam and has more than 18 percent clay on the basis of 15 bar water of 9 or 10 percent.\nThe 2Bx horizon (fragipan) has variegated colors, distinct high or low chroma redox features and tongues or coatings with chroma of 2.  It has massive, prismatic or platy structure and is firm or very firm."
