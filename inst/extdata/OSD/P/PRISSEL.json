  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the sandy mantle and depth to the stratified loamy and sandy alluvium ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the pedon.  Redox accumulations and saturation occur within a depth of 72 inches.  Saturation does not occur within a depth of 40 inches for than 1 month or more per year, in 6 or more out of 10 years.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Reaction naturally ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral in Ap horizons where the soil is limed.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is typically sand or loamy sand but includes fine sand and loamy fine sand.  Reaction naturally ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral where the soil is limed.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sand, or sand.  Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid, but ranges to neutral in the upper part where the soil is limed.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is stratified.  Individual strata are mostly sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam, with thin (<3\") strata of coarser texture.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 3BC and 3C horizons have hue of 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  These horizons are stratified.  Individual strata are mostly sand or fine sand with thin (typically <1\") strata of finer texture.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Brice(T), Delton, Metea, Okee, Ormas, Puchyan, Rohrbeck, and Seward series.  Brice soils have lamellae (E&Bt horizon) in the lower part of the argillic horizon and do not have redox features or saturation in the series control section.  Delton and Seward soils have 35 percent or more clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Metea, Okee, Ormas, and Rohrbeck soils have free carbonates in the lower part of the series control section.  Puchyan soils have more than 50 percent silt with 12 to 20 percent clay in the middle or lower part of the series control section, or in both."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Prissel soils are used for cropland.  Corn, soybeans, small grains, and hay are the principal crops.  A few areas remain in woodland.  Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and pine forest.  Common trees are northern pin oak, jack pine, red pine, and eastern white pine."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Prior to 1996, Prissel soils were mapped as a loamy substratum phase of the Plainfield series.  A Grossarenic subgroup is needed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - 0 to 9 inches (Ap); argillic horizon - 48 to 56 inches (2Bt1, 2Bt2); arenic feature - sandy particle size throughout a layer extending from the mineral soil surface to the top of an argillic horizon at a depth of 50 cm or more (0 to 48 inches; Ap, Bw1, Bw2, Bw3).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Soil Interpretation Record - WI0601\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
