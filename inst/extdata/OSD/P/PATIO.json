  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 35 inches.  Base saturation is less than 75 percent in some part of the upper 30 inches or above the bedrock. The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F. The mean summer temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 66 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry for 50 to 80 consecutive days during the summer. Rock fragments consist of angular argillite, phyllite and schist pebbles and cobbles, and range from 20 to 40 percent in the Al horizon and 55 to 70 percent in the B2 horizon.\nThe Al horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist. It is slightly acid to neutral and is 8 to 13 inches thick.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist. It ranges from very gravelly heavy loam or light clay loam to very cobbly light clay loam. Structure ranges from weak to moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky. This horizon is slightly acid to medium acid and is 10 to 24 inches thick."

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from argillite, phyllite, and schist. The climate is moist subhumid, and the average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 25 inches. The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is 56 to 62 degrees F., and the frost-free period ranges from 80 to 90 days."
