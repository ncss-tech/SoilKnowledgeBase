  "OVERVIEW": "The Patio series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from argillite, phyllite and schist. These soils are on south and east facing mountain slopes. The mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
