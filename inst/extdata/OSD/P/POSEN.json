  "OVERVIEW": "The Posen series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy deposits on till plains and glacial lake benches.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
