  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness typically is 6 feet or more but ranges from 4 to 8 feet.  In general, free carbonates are lacking to depths of 10 feet or more.\nThe A or Ap horizon typically has hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe E horizon typically has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2.  In many pedons, the E horizon is mixed in the Ap horizon.\nThe BE horizon has 2.5Y or 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction of the E and BE horizons typically is medium acid or strongly acid but ranges to very strongly acid in the E horizons of some pedons.\nThe Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 8.  These horizons are silty clay or silty clay loam.  The finest part of these horizons generally contains between 42 and 48 percent clay.  The upper boundary of the finest part of the Bt horizon commonly is within depths of 14 to 20 inches below the surface.  The upper part of the Bt horizon has thin, discontinuous silt coats, but they are lacking in the lower part.  Reaction of the Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons ranges from medium acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bt4 and Bt5 horizons range from slightly acid to strongly acid. The Bt4 and Bt5 horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 through 6; and chroma of 1 through 6.  Silty clay loam textures commonly extend to depths of 5 feet or more, but some pedons are silt loam in the lower part of the sola.  In some pedons, on uplands, the lower part of the sola formed in paleosols."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Armstrong, Hoyleton, Mystic, and Sunbury series of the same family and the Atterberry, Belinda, Givin, Hedrick, Kniffin, Ladoga, Mexico, and Weller series.  Armstrong and Hoyleton soils have 2B horizons that contain more sand and coarse fragments.  Mystic soils contain more sand throughout the solum. Sunbury soils have 2B horizons and have free carbonates above depths of 60 inches.  Atterberry soils are fine-silty.  Belinda soils have thicker E horizons and have an abrupt change in texture from the E horizon to the B horizon.  Givin and Hedrick soils have less clay in the Bt horizons.  Kniffin soils are shallower to the horizon highest in clay and contain more clay in the finest part.  Ladoga soils have less clay in the B horizons and are deeper to mottles or colors of low chroma.  Mexico soils have a thinner solum and have more clay in at least part of the B horizon.  In addition, Mexico soils have common or many red mottles.  Weller soils have lighter colored or thinner A horizons or both and the upper part of the B horizon commonly has redder hue and higher value and chroma."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pershing soils typically are on convex slopes bordering the flat interstream divides in the loess-covered Kansan and Nebraskan till plain.  They also are on benches in a few places.  On uplands, these soils are underlain by paleosols at depths of 6 to 10 feet.  On benches, they are underlain below depths of 4 or more feet by alluvium of Wisconsin or pre-Wisconsin age.  Slopes range from 2 to 14 percent.  These soils formed in loess that contains less than 5 percent sand and is of Wisconsin age.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 50 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 32 to 36 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Belinda and Weller soils and the Adair, Gara, and Grundy soils.  Belinda soils are on nearly level interfluves.  Weller soils are on similar landscape positions as the Pershing soils.  Adair and Gara soils are on the more sloping parts of the landscape at slightly lower elevations.  These soils have more coarse fragments in their sola, and Gara soils are lower in clay.  Grundy soils are on similar slopes and have mollic epipedons.  In some places, soils formed in residuum weathered from shale are on nearby lower slopes."
