    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 47 degrees F., and a mean summer soil temperature immediately above bedrock of about 59 to 64 degrees F.  The soil moisture regime is typic ustic.\nThe mollic epipedon is 4 to 13 inches thick and constitutes over one-third the thickness of soil above bedrock.  The depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments average 35 to 60 percent in the particle-size control section.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 27 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 dry and moist.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is very channery, very gravelly or very cobbly loam, or very cobbly sandy loam.\nSecondary carbonates are recognized as coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments in Bk horizons that replace the C horizon in some pedons.  Secondary carbonates can occur at a depth of 7 to 15 inches."

The soils formed in collluvium and/or residuum on limestone and calcareous sandstone.  Slope gradients are 2 to 80 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches and the freeze free period ranges from 60 to 100 days.  The mean annual temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F."
