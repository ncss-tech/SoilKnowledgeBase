  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinto series consists of moderately well drained soils that formed in material derived mainly from sedimentary alluvium.  Pinto soils are on marine terraces and old alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 57 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil between depths of 7 and 21 inches becomes moist in some part in October or November and remains moist until May.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 59 to 61 degrees F.  The solum is medium acid to neutral. Rock fragments make up 0 to 15 percent of the soil.  Base saturation is more than 75 percent throughout the upper 30 inches of the B2t horizon.\nThe A1 horizon is grayish brown, brown or dark grayish brown (10YR 5/2, 5/3, 4/2, 4/3).  It is very fine sandy loam, loam or light clay loam.\nThe A2 horizon is light brownish gray, pale brown, light gray or very pale brown (10YR 6/2, 6/3, 7/2, 7/3).  It is fine sandy loam, loam or light clay loam.  Color of the A2 horizon comes from coatings of the mineral grains.\nThe B2t horizon is brown, yellowish brown, light yellowish brown, brownish yellow, or very pale brown (10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/4, 6/6, 7/3) or light brown or reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/4, 6/6).  Coatings on faces of peds are white, light gray or light brownish gray silt in hue of 10YR or 2.5Y.  Concretions and stains are black or very dark gray.  This horizon is loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam and has about 25 to 35 percent clay.\nThe C horizon is reddish yellow, brown, light yellowish brown or very pale brown (7.5YR 7/6, 6/6, 5/4; 10YR 6/4, 7/3) with prominent very dark gray or black (10YR 2/1, 3/1) stains.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  This horizon is moderately acid or strongly acid.  In some pedons below a depth of 40 inches, the substratum is weakly silica cemented."

Elevation is 20 to 1,000 feet.  The soils are in a subhumid mesothermal climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches.  The average January temperature is 48 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 61 degrees F; and the average annual temperature is 57 to 59 degrees F.  The frost free season is about 250 days."
