  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is more than 60 inches thick.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 14 to 32 inches.  The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout except where the surface layers have been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Some pedons have a thin A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6, with mottles in shades of brown, yellow, and gray, or it is mottles in these colors.  Mottles with chroma of 2 or less are within 16 inches of the surface.  Texture is silt loam or loam.  The particle-size control section, the section between a depth of 10 inches and the upper boundary of the fragipan, has 10 to 18 percent clay andhas less than 15 percent fine and coarser sand.\nThe E' horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silt loam that has less clay than either the overlying Bw or the underlying  Bx horizons.  Some pedons have an E/B or B/E horizon that is mottled in shades of brown and gray.\nThe Bx horizon has a matrix in hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 with few to many mottles that have chroma of 2 or less; also mottles in shades of yellow and brown commonly are few to many; or, the horizon is mottled in these colors.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.  The layers highest in clay are in this horizon."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Closely related series include the Bude, Calloway, Leadvale, Longview, Paden, Prentiss, Sango, and Taft soils.  Bude, Calloway, Leadvale, Paden, and Taft soils have a fine-silty particle size class; also, Bude, Calloway and Paden have mixed mineralogy; also Bude and Calloway soils have more than 35 percent base saturation at 30 inches below the upper boundary of the fragipan.  Longview soils have a fine-silty particle size class and do not have a fragipan.  Prentiss soils have a fine-loamy particle size class and do not have mottles with chroma of 2 or less within 16 inches of the surface.  Sango soils do not have mottles with chroma of 2 or less within 16 inches of the surface."

The somewhat poorly drained Bude soils are in similar positions as the Pheba soils, on broad terraces.  The moderately well drained Cane and Ora soils, which have a fine-loamy control section and an argillic horizon above the fragipan, are on adjacent higher lying ridges and hillsides.  Somewhat poorly drained Stough soils, which have a coarse-loamy control section and do not have a fragipan, are in similar positions as the Pheba soils.  The poorly drained Weston soils, which have a coarse-loamy control section, are predominantly gray, and do not have a fragipan, are in depressions, swales, and in drainageways."
