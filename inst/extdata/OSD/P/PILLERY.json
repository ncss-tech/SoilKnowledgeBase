  "OVERVIEW": "The Pillery series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains and low terraces at elevations of 900 to 1,200 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 100 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

Base saturation (by sum) is assumed to be 40 to 65 percent.\nThe upper part of the A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, and value of 6 or 7 dry.  It is stratified with lenses of loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, and silt loam.\nThe lower part of the A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, and value of 3 or 4 moist.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.  It has 5 to 15 percent rock fragments.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 to 5.
