Base saturation (by sum) is assumed to be 40 to 65 percent.\nThe upper part of the A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, and value of 6 or 7 dry.  It is stratified with lenses of loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, and silt loam.\nThe lower part of the A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, and value of 3 or 4 moist.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.  It has 5 to 15 percent rock fragments.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 to 5.

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pillery soils are on flood plains and low terraces at elevations of 900 to 1,200 feet.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from basic igneous rock.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters.\nAverage annual precipitation is 90 to 110 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 130 days."
