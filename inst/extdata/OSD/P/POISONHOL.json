  "OVERVIEW": "The Poisonhol series consists of moderately deep, well drained, soilsthat are formed in mixed alluvium. They are on coalesced fan terraces and hillsides.  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
