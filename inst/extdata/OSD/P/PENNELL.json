Herlong soils have hue of 10YR or yellower, have sodium adsorption ratios of more than 13, and have uncemented parent materials below the lithic contact.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pennell soils are on mesas and benches at elevations of 3,120 to 5,500 feet.  Slopes range from 1 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium, residuum, and eolian material from sedimentary rocks. The average annual precipitation is 5 to 10 inches.  The precipitation is distributed evenly throughout the year with a slight bulge from July to October.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 180 days."
