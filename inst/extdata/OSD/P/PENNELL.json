  "OVERVIEW": "The Pennell series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in colluvium, residuum and eolian material from sedimentary rocks.  These soils are on mesas and benches.  Slopes are 1 to 50 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is about 6 inches.",

These soils formed in colluvium, residuum, and eolian material from sedimentary rocks. The average annual precipitation is 5 to 10 inches.  The precipitation is distributed evenly throughout the year with a slight bulge from July to October.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 180 days."
