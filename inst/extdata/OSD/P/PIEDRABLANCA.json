  "OVERVIEW": "The Piedrablanca series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in gypsiferous eolian deposits over gypsiferous lacustrine deposits. These nearly level soils are on interdune areas overlying playa steps, and stabilized, vegetated playa steps. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 67 degrees F.",
