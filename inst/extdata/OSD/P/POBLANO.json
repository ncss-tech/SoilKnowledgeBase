  "OVERVIEW": "The Poblano series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in colluvium and alluvium from monzonite.  These strongly sloping to steep soils are on mountain flanks and bases.  Slope ranges from 5 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F.",
