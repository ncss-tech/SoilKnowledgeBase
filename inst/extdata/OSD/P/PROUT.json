    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments are of shale and sandstone lithology in the A and B horizons, and are of shale lithology in the 2BC or 2C horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 (6 or more dry), and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 2 to 15 percent. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to extremely acid. Some undisturbed pedons have an A horizon 1 to 4 inches thick.\nUndisturbed pedons have an E or BE horizon 3 to 8 inches thick. Rock fragment content ranges from 2 to 20 percent. Reaction ranges from is strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe Bt or Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. At least one subhorizon above a depth of 30 inches has chroma of 3 or more. It is silty clay loam or clay loam or their channery analogues. Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 25 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid or extremely acid.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is channery or very channery analogues of silty clay loam or clay loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 60 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid or extremely acid.\nSome pedon have a 2C horizon with similar characteristics to the 2BC horizon.\nBedrock commonly is soft shale that is weathered in the upper part."

The very poorly drained Fries and Pewamo soils are in low lying areas and drainageways, and in addition, Pewamo soils are more than 60 inches to shale. The moderately well drained Bogart soils are on low beach ridges composed of gravel having a high content of sandstone and shale. The well drained Colyer soils are shallow to bedrock, and are on broad shale ridges and steeper slopes along drainageways. Fitchville soils are on similar landscape positions, but formed entirely in lacustrine sediments."

Depth to an intermittent apparent seasonal high water table is .5 to 1 foot below the surface during December to April of most years. Permeability is moderately slow. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low."
