  "OVERVIEW": "The Paoli series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium. Paoli soils are on fans and terraces and have slopes of 0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 36 centimeters (14 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F.) at the type location.",
