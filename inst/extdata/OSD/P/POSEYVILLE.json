  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Poseyville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy and loamy material less than 61 cm (24 inches) thick overlying loamy till or lacustrine deposits on till plains and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).",
