  "OVERVIEW": "The Phizphre series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from limestone.  The Phizphre soils are on summits and shoulders of plateaus.  Slopes range from 8 to 15 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is 55 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",
