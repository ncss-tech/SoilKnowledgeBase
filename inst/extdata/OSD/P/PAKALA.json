    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are very stratified; thickness and texture of the horizons ranges widely in short distances.  Effervescence with hydrogen peroxide ranges from slight to strong.  The soils have hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 2 through 4 and chroma of 2 through 4.  The C horizon can be stratified with very fine sand, sand, and gravel. The thin smeary layers in the C horizon are absent in some pedons.  Mean annual soil temperature is about 23 degrees C.
