  "OVERVIEW": "The Pakala series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium weathered from basic igneous rock.  Pakala soils are on alluvial fans and in valleys; and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 762 millimeters (30 inches) and mean annual air temperature is about 23 degrees C. (74 degrees F.)",

Effervescence with hydrogen peroxide ranges from slight to strong.  The soils have hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 2 through 4 and chroma of 2 through 4.  The C horizon can be stratified with very fine sand, sand, and gravel. The thin smeary layers in the C horizon are absent in some pedons.  Mean annual soil temperature is about 23 degrees C.
