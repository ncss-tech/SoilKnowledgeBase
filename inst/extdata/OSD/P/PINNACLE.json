  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to lithic contact with hard, unweathered bedrock ranges from 21 to 40 inches.  Mineral layers, where present, at the soil bedrock interface range from 2 to 17 inches thick and are less than 50 percent of the overall thickness of the pedon.  The organic material and the mineral material are extremely acid.\nThe Oi horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 2, and chroma of 1.  It is slightly decomposed organic material from rhododendron and sand myrtle (fibric material).\nThe Oe horizon has a hue 5YR, value of 2.5, and chroma of 2.  It is partially decomposed organic material from rhododendron and sand myrtle (hemic material).\nThe Oa horizon has a hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 2.5, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is highly decomposed organic material from rhododendron and sand myrtle (sapric material).\nThe mineral horizons where present, (A, Bw, or C) have hue of 10YR or 5YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is loam or silt loam or the mucky versions thereof.\nSome pedons have a thin Cr horizon at the soil-rock interface that is fractured metasedimentary rock.\nThe R layer is slightly to highly fractured metasedimentary rock."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  Ricker soils are in a related family.  Ricker soils are on landscapes affected by glacial activity in Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire, and New York and have cryic soil temperature regimes.  Pinnacle soils are on nonglacial landscapes and have a frigid soil tempereature regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pinnacle soils are on ridges and mountain slopes at high elevations in the Southern Blue Ridge (MLRA 130B).  The mean annual air temperature is 45 F, frost free season ranges from 90 to 135 days, and the average annual rainfall ranges 80 to 100 inches.  Elevation ranges from 3800 to 6700 feet.  Slopes range from 5 to 95 percent.  These soils are on the heath balds that occur on summits, spur ridges, side slopes, and nose slopes.  Bedrock is metasandstone and phyllite of the Thunderhead and Anakeesta formations."
