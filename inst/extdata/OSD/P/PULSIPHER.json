  "OVERVIEW": "The Pulsipher series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from metamorphic rocks. Pulsipher soils are on foothills of mountains and have 15 to 30 percent slopes. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 57 F.",

Garr soils are strongly alkaline, have less than 0.6 percent organic matter and are never moist in any part of the moisture control section during the summer. Virgin Peak soils have a mollic epipedon, and are usually moist in some or all parts of their moisture control section during a major part of the summer."

The soils formed in material weathered from metamorphic rocks mainly gneiss and schist. The average annual temperature is about 55 to 58F.; average precipitation is about 8 to 11 inches; and frost-free season is about 200 days."
