  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Garr and Virgin Peak series. Garr soils are strongly alkaline, have less than 0.6 percent organic matter and are never moist in any part of the moisture control section during the summer. Virgin Peak soils have a mollic epipedon, and are usually moist in some or all parts of their moisture control section during a major part of the summer."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Pulsipher soils are on foothills and lower slopes of mountains at elevations of 3500 to 4,500 feet. Slopes are 15 to 30 percent. The soils formed in material weathered from metamorphic rocks mainly gneiss and schist. The average annual temperature is about 55 to 58F.; average precipitation is about 8 to 11 inches; and frost-free season is about 200 days."
