  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 60 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Rock fragments, mostly sandstone gravels and channers, range from 0 to 30 percent in the solum and 0 to 75 percent in the substratum. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through extremely acid, unless limed.\nThe Ap or A horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. If value is 3, dry color is 6 or more. Fine-earth texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Some pedons have iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less below 40 inches. Fine-earth texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Some pedons have iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less. Fine-earth texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam, or stratified layers of these textures. Some pedons have stratified sand layers below 40 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Comus and Linden series are members of the same family. Comus soils formed in alluvium high in mica. Linden soils allow 5YR or redder hue in the Bw horizon. Linden soils have redder colors in the solum. Series in closely related families are McNulty, Occum and Wenonah. These soils are all in a superactive CEC activity class. Additionally, McNulty soils occur in areas where mean annual precipitation ranges from 60 to 90 inches. Occum soils formed in alluvium derived mostly from gneiss, granite and schist. Wenonah soils formed in post glacial alluvium from glacial drift and contain more feldspars and weatherable minerals."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pope soils are on flood plains with slopes mainly less than 4 percent. They formed in alluvium weathered from Pennsylvanian aged acid sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Near the OSD site average annual air temperature ranges from 48 to 57 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation from 42 to 54 inches."

Allegheny, Atkins, Cotaco, Gilpin, Jefferson, Monongahela, Muskingum, Rowdy and Shelocta soils are fine-loamy. Cuba, Morehead and Stendal soils are fine-silty. Allegheny, Clymer, Cotaco, Gilpin, Jefferson, Monongahela and Shelocta soils have argillic horizons.  . Atkins soils are poorly drained. Cotaco and Morehead soils are moderately well or somewhat poorly drained. Monongahela and Philo soils are moderately well drained. Stendal soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Gilpin, Matewan and Muskingum soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Monongahela soils have fragipans."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Pope soils were classified in the Alluvial great soil group in the 1938 classification system. The 7/99 and 12/99 revisions update Pope to 8th edition standards. The CEC activity class placement is based on similar geographically associated soils such as Philo and Stendal. Competing series were also updated.\n10/05 revision added location data and a review of over 40 pedons in KY that revealed only 2 instances of 7.5YR color in the Bw horizon, confirming that Pope is centered on the more yellow hues that differentiate it from the Linden Series.\nDiagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon)\nCambic horizon: The zone from 8 to 42 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)\nMLRAs: 115, 116B, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 140, 144A, 147, 148, 149A\nRevised: 4/94-JHN,WHC,JMR; 7/99-SJH,DBD; 12/99-BAW,DHK; 10/05 JDM\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
