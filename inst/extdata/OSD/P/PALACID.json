Balon, Decolney, Gaddes, Rauzi and Spenlo soils are noncalcareous to depth of 35 inches or more.  Barx, Cerrillos, Clovis, Fernando, Hiland, Los Alamos, Millett, Scholle, Sundance, Tapia, Toluca, and Tuweep soils have calcic horizons.  Bowbac, Cushman, Fattig, Flaco, Gaddes, Gapbutte, Hagerman, Pokeman, Progresso, Pugsley, and Spangler soils have lithic or paralithic contact at depths between 20 and 40 inches.  Buckle soils are calcareous at 20 to 35 inches.  Cambria and Stoneham soils are less than 13 inches deep to the base of the Bt horizon.  Oelop soils have have Bt horizons with a base less than 40 inches deep.  Forkwood, Fort Collins, Harbord, Olney, Potts, and Threetop soils are moist in some part periodically during April, May, and June.  Maysdorf soils have Bt horizons with hue of 5YR or 2.5YR.  Olney, Penistaja and Yenlo soils have 40 to 75 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine sands or coarser."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 8 inches.  (A and AB horizons) (this layer is too thin to qualify as a mollic epipedon)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from about 8 to 45 inches.  (Bt and Btk horizons)\nUstollic feature - organic carbon content and soil moisture regime meets the requirement for \"Ustollic\".\nIn October 2000, taxonomic classification was converted to the closest match found in Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition 1999.  No update was made to horizon nomenclature, competing series section, etc.  Other placements may be more appropriate after a complete update.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
