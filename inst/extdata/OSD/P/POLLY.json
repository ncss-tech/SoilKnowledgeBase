  "OVERVIEW": "The Polly series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium with a minor influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  Polly soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
