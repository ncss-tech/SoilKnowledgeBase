The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. The particle-size control section contains 25 to 35 percent clay.  Depth to calcium carbonate accumulation and the base of the argillic horizon is 15 to 25 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of  2 or 3 moist,  4 or 5 dry, and chroma of  2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe Bt horizon has value of  2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of  2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam or sandy clay loam and contains 0 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe Bk horizon has value of  3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of  2 or 3 moist and dry. It is loam or sandy loam and contains 0 to 30 percent gravel. It is slightly to moderately alkaline.  It is slightly to violently effervescent."

Caliralls soils are 25 to 43 inches to secondary carbonates.  Drybed soils are 8 to 20 inches deep to secondary carbonates and carbonates are present throughout the argillic horizon.  Haw soils have carbonates at 22 to 38 inches and are greater than 5 inches to the top of the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Polly soils are on fan terraces at elevations of  3,000 to 3,800 feet.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium with a minor influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches, the mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F, and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
