The soils are usually moist, but are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days in late summer. The upper 10 to 25 inches of the 10- to 40-inch control section is silty clay loam, silt loam, or loam and averages 18 to 35 percent clay, more than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand and less than 35 percent rock fragments. A strongly contrasting sand and gravel layer is at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR and chroma of 2 or 3. It is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. It has weak or very weak prismatic and/or weak or very weak subangular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3."
