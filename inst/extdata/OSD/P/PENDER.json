  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A and upper B horizon unless limed and moderately acid to mildly alkaline in the lower B horizon.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 and 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe upper Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 4 to 7, and chromas of 3 through 8.  The lower Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 8, and is mottled.  Low chroma colors occur within the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Silt content in the control section is less than 30 percent.  The clay content of the Bt horizon is more than 2 times the clay content of the A or E horizon.\nThe BCg and Cg horizon is gray with mottles in shades of brown, yellow, and red.  It is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Thin strata of loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or clay are present in some pedons.\nThe 2Cg horizon is light colored soft marl, interbedded with clay and sandy clay in most pedons.  Some pedons contain hard marl fragments and manganese concretions.  Also some pedons contain platy ironstone fragments that occur as a discontinuous capping over the marl.  Some pedons do not have a 2Cg horizon of marl and may be sandy, loamy, or clayey marine or fluvial sediments."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Closely related soils are the Goldsboro, Grifton, Invershiel, Meggett, and Tanyard.  Goldsboro, Meggett, and Tanyard soils are not underlain by marl.  In addition, Goldsboro soil lacks the abrupt textural change and the base saturation in less than 35 percent.  Meggett soils have an aquic moisture regime and is in the five family.  Tanyard soils have a lower base saturation and lack an abrupt textural changes.  Grifton soils have an aquic moisture regime and lack an abrupt textural change.  Invershield soils are in the five family and have montmorillinitic minerology."
