  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinavetes series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian deposits derived from mixed material on dunes. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

Calladito soils have 8 to 10 inches precipitation and are noneffervescent. Dwyer, Karval, Valent, Orpha, and Tullock soils are moist in some part periodically during May and June. Karval soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments. Mido soils have hues of 7.5YR or redder. Pensom soils are deep to sandstone. Tullock soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Valent and Wigton soils are noncalcareous."
