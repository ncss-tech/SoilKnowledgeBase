  "OVERVIEW": "The Patel series consists of well drained, slowly permeable, sodic soils which are moderately deep to soft bedrock.  Patel soils formed in alluvium, slope alluvium and residuum derived from shale, siltstone, and limestone on footslopes below structural benches and cuestas. Slopes are 5 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
