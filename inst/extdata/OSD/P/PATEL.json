    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Patel soils are on footslopes below structural benches and gently dipping cuestas.  They formed in alluvium and residuum derived from shale, siltstone, and dolomitic limestone.  Slopes are 5 to 25 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,800 to 5,400 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

Salinity values were also determined on three pedons, including the type location, with a Wheatstone bridge.  Calcium carbonate equivalence determined with a field volume calcimeter.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
