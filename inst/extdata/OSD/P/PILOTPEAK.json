  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the lithic contact is 7 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 68 degrees F.   Clay content in the particle-size control section ranges from 5 to 17 percent.  Rock fragment content in the particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 70 percent.  Rock fragments are dominantly 3 to 6 inch channers, angular cobbles, and some coarse pebbles.  The surface is covered with 15 to 80 percent similar rock fragments.  Reaction of the profile is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR; value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist; and chroma of 3 through 6 dry and moist.  Coarse fragments range from 5 to 25 percent coarse pebbles and 10 to 20 percent angular cobbles.\nThe Bk and or Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR; value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist; and chroma of 3 through 6 dry and moist.  Texture usually is very fine sandy loam,  fine sandy loam or sandy loam with 35 to 70 percent rock fragments typically 5 to 50 percent angular cobble and 15 to 55 percent coarse pebbles.  Secondary calcium carbonate occurs as small concretions in the matrix and as pendants on rock fragments. Secondary calcium carbonate content ranges from 15 to 35 percent."

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and \"redbed\" sandstone. Some areas are interbeded with conglomerate. Elevation is 6,000 to 8000 feet. Precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is approximately 60 to 110 days."
