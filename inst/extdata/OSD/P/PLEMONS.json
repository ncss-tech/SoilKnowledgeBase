  "OVERVIEW": "The Plemons series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy sediments derived from the upper part of the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age. These soils are on gently to strongly sloping valley sides, draws, or broad erosion remnants. The slope ranges from 1 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 496 mm (18 in) and the mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (58 degrees F).",
