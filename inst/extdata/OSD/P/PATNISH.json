Depth to aquic conditions ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches. The upper 8 to 15 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.15 to 1.40 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 0.7 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples. The upper part of the particle-size control section averages 18 to 25 percent clay and 5 to 35 percent rock fragments and the lower part has 8 to 14 percent clay and more than 65 percent rock fragments. Base saturation throughout the upper 30 inches is 55 to 75 percent. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout. Depth to contrasting extremely gravelly or extremely cobbly sand or loamy sand 3C horizons is 25 to 35 inches.\nThe Ap and A1 horizons have value of 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist. Texture is ashy loam, ashy sandy loam or ashy sandy clay loam.\nThe A2 and AB horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry. Texture is loam, sandy loam or sandy clay loam with 18 to 27 percent clay.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.
