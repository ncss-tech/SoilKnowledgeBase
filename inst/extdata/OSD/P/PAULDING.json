  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Related soils are the Covington, Hoytville, Latty, Livingston, Panton, Toledo, and Wetzel series. Covington, Hoytville, Panton, and Wetzel soils have argillic horizons. Latty and Toledo soils have less than 60 percent clay throughout the sola, and in addition, Toledo soils have a dark surface layer. Livingston soils have a dark surface layer."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Paulding soils are on broad level or nearly level parts of lake plains that have a linear or concave surface. Slope gradient commonly is less than 1 percent but ranges to 2 percent. The soils formed in very fine-textured, calcareous lacustrine material that has evidence of weak lamination. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 965 mm (28 to 38 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 11 degrees C (47 to 52 degrees F). Frost free days range from 150 to 230 days. Elevations range from 175 m to 230 m (574 to 756 feet)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Broughton and Roselms soils that are in a toposequence with Paulding soils, and the Defiance, Fulton, Hoytville, Latty, Nappanee, St. Clair, and Wabasha soils. Moderately well drained Broughton soils are on gently sloping to steep dissected areas adjacent to drainageways. Somewhat poorly drained Roselms soils are on slightly higher landscape positions or are on gently sloping or sloping areas adjacent to drainageways. Defiance and Wabasha soils are on nearby flood plains. Fulton soils contain less clay and are on slightly higher landscape positions. Hoytville and Latty soils are on similar landscape positions but contain less clay, and in addition, the Hoytville soils formed in till. Nappanee and St. Clair soils formed in till and have argillic horizons."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 15 cm (6 inches) below the surface from January to April or  during periods of high rainfall. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low in the subsoil and very low in the substratum."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: The Paulding soils are largely cleared and cultivated or used for pasture. Principal crops are soybean, wheat, hay, and some corn. Native vegetation is deciduous swamp forest."
