  "OVERVIEW": "The Paulding series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that are moderately deep or deep to dense clayey lacustrine material. These soils formed in clayey glaciolacustrine deposits. They are on lake plains and till-floored lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Paulding soils are on broad level or nearly level parts of lake plains that have a linear or concave surface. Slope gradient commonly is less than 1 percent but ranges to 2 percent. The soils formed in very fine-textured, calcareous lacustrine material that has evidence of weak lamination. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 965 mm (28 to 38 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 11 degrees C (47 to 52 degrees F). Frost free days range from 150 to 230 days. Elevations range from 175 m to 230 m (574 to 756 feet)."

Moderately well drained Broughton soils are on gently sloping to steep dissected areas adjacent to drainageways. Somewhat poorly drained Roselms soils are on slightly higher landscape positions or are on gently sloping or sloping areas adjacent to drainageways. Defiance and Wabasha soils are on nearby flood plains. Fulton soils contain less clay and are on slightly higher landscape positions. Hoytville and Latty soils are on similar landscape positions but contain less clay, and in addition, the Hoytville soils formed in till. Nappanee and St. Clair soils formed in till and have argillic horizons."

The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 15 cm (6 inches) below the surface from January to April or  during periods of high rainfall. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low in the subsoil and very low in the substratum."
