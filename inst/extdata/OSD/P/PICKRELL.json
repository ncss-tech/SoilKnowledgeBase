These soils formed in eolian deposits and residuum from sandstone.  The climate is arid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 8 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 52 degrees to 56 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 72 degrees to 77 degrees F., and the frost-free period ranges from 150 to 180 days."
