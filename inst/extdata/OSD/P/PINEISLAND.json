  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 70 to 120 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the solum.  The effective cation exchange capacity of the solum is 3 to 11 (C mole+/kg).  The soil is 20 to 50 percent saturated with exchangeable aluminum from the E horizon to a depth of 60 inches or more.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Ec horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe E/B and B/E horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Btx and Bt horizons have hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Iron depletions are in shades of gray and range from none to common. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe BC and C horizons, where present, have the same range in colors and reactions as the Btx and Bt horizons.  Texture is loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.  Bude, Bussy, Byram, Calloway, Cart, Erno, Gigger, Grenada, Libuse, Loring, Necessity, Olivier, Providence, and Thage soils are in related families.  Bude, Calloway, Necessity, Thage, and Olivier soils have 1 or 2 chroma mottles in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  Bussy, Cyram, Gigger, Grenada, Libuse, Loring, and Providence soils do not have a glossic horizon.  In addition, Byram, Gigger, Grenada, Loring, and Providence soils have mixed mineralogy.  Cart soils have coarse-silty and Erno soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pineisland soils are on elongated, deltaic natural levees on the Gulf Coast Prairie.  They formed in loamy alluvial sediments of Pleistocene age.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 53 inches.  Elevation is 10 to 40 feet."

The Crowley, Frost, Leton, and Mowata soils are in lower positions and are more poorly drained than Pineisland soils.  They have dominant colors with chroma of 2 or less throughout the solum.  The Mamou and Messer soils are on side-slopes and on pimple mounds, respectively.  Neither the Mamou nor the Messer soils have a fragipan."
