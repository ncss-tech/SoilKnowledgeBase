  "OVERVIEW": "The Pulaski series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable flood plain soils that formed in loamy alluvial sediments of Holocene age. These nearly level to very gently sloping flood plain soils are on small tributaries in the Cross Timbers (MLRA-84A). Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 16.1 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 864 mm (34 in).",
