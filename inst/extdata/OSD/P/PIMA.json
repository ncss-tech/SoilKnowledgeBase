  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pima soils are on alluvial fans and flood plains.  Elevations range from 1,100 to 5,400 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in stratified and mixed alluvium from volcanic, granitic, metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  The climate is warm and dry.  The average annual precipitation is 6 to 12 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and winter rain and snow.  The mean annual temperature is 54 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 180 to 240 days."
