Presher soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt mixed with loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash. Summers are dry and warm; winters are cool and moist. The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 30 inches. The average January temperature is 26 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 64 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
