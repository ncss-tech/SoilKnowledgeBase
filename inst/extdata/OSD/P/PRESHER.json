  "OVERVIEW": "The Presher series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt mixed with loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash. Presher soils are on plateaus and footslopes of mountains. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
