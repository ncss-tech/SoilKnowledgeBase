  "OVERVIEW": "The Pywell series consists of very deep, very poorly drained organic soils in depressional areas of bottomlands, drainageways and flood plains. They formed in material derived dominantly from herbaceous plants, but including some woody materials. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 625 mm, and the average annual air temperature is about 7.2 degrees C.",
