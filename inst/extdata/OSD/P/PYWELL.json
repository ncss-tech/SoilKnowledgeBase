They are used primarily for production of spring wheat, oats, barley, grass seed, hay, and pasture. Some areas are used for wetland wildlife habitat. Natural vegetation is willow, black cottonwood, thinleaf alder, pyramid spirea, narrowleaf cattail, reed canary grass, sedge, and rush with scattered western redcedar and Englemann spruce along edges of meadows."
