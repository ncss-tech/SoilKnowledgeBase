  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 8 to 24 inches.  Depth to the loamy glacial till ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The upper sediment contains from 0 to 25 percent gravel in the A and E horizons and averages 35 to 65 percent in the B horizons.  The underlying glacial till contains from 5 to 15 percent rock fragments.  The rock fragments are mixed in lithology, but limestone and granite are major components.   The soil moisture control section is not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days in most years.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is coarse sand, sand, fine sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Some subhorizons are loamy coarse sand or loamy sand.  The average texture of the Bt horizon is coarse sandy loam or finer.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Mottles are in all parts of this horizon in some pedons. The fine earth fraction is coarse sand, sand, fine sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has few to many mottles.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 40 percent.  Some pedons have a 2C horizon with the same range of color and texture as the 2Bw horizon."

They formed in 20 to 40 inches of gravelly lacustrine sediments overlying loamy glacial till.  These deposits are Late Wisconsinan in age.  Mean annual temperature is 36 to 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 19 to 24 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 130.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 785 to 1350 feet."
