  "OVERVIEW": "The Pedleford series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and eolian material reworked by water over basalt.  Pedleford soils are on basalt plains and buttes and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent. Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
