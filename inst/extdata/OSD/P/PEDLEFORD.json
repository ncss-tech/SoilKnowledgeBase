  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pedleford soils are on basalt plains and buttes.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,700 to 6,000 feet.  The soil formed in loess and eolian material reworked by water over basalt. The average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, most of which falls as winter snow and early spring rain.  The average annual air temperature is about 41 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."

Deerhorn and Wildors soils have average annual soil temperatures warmer than 47 degrees F.  McCarey soils have an argillic horizon and has less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Molyneux soils have argillic horizons and are very deep.  Rehfield soils are deep and very deep and have average annual soil temperatures warmer than 47 degrees F.  Cox, Deerhorn, McCarey, and Wildors soils occur on convex positions on basalt plains and sides of buttes.  Molyneaux and Rehfield soils occur in drainageways and depressions on basalt plains."
