  "OVERVIEW": "The Perinos series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable, soils that formed in material weathered from basic igneous rocks. Perinos soils are on mountain slopes and have slopes of 3 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 35 degrees F.",

Burnette, Cochetopa, Faim, Fulcher, Grouseville, Luna, Slights, Sudduth, Sudpeak, and Teedown soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the argillic horizon.  Burnette soils have a calcic horizon. Cochetopa soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section. Fulcher soils have an accumulation of carbonate at depths of 17 to 50 inches.  Luna soils have an A1 horizon less than 6 inches thick and are 20 to 40 inches deep over decomposing ash or tuff. Friana soils are mottled in the lower part of the argillic horizon with black coatings that effervesce with hydrogen peroxide. Mayflower and Runlett soils are 20 to 40 inches deep over bedrock. Paulson soils have an A1 horizon 4 to 8 inches thick and have a silty clay argillic horizon. Richens soils have an A2 horizon and have a argillic horizon that is medium acid or slightly acid and has a chroma of 6 or more. Skutum soils have a gravelly argillic horizon with 15 to 35 percent gravel. Slights soils have boulders throughout the profile and have a lithologic discontinuity that separates the upper and lower part of the B2t horizon. Sudpeak soils have a Bg (gleyed) horizon and are moderately well drained. Toponce soils have a combined thickness of the A and B horizons that is greater than 60 inches and the particle size control section is moderately to slightly acid."
