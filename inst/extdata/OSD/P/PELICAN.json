These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the volcanic ash influence and the mollic epipedon is 10 to 25 inches, and has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried sampled.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 55 percent rock fragments and 10 to 18 percent clay.  Depth to the densic material is 35 to 50 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe 2Bw1 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam,  It has 15 to 35 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  This horizon has a minor amount of ash but does not qualify as Vitrandic.\nThe 2Bw2 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It averages 30 to 45 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 3C1 and 3C2 horizons have chroma of 4 or 6 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam or very cobbly sandy loam.  It has 35 to 45 percent gravel and 0 to 25 percent cobbles.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 3Cd horizon has chroma of 4 or 6 dry or moist.  It is dense glacial till that crushes to very gravelly sandy loam or very cobbly sandy loam.   It has 35 to 45 percent gravel and 0 to 25 percent cobbles.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral."
