  "OVERVIEW": "The Pelican series consists of moderately deep to deep to densic material, well drained soils formed in till with minor amounts of colluvium from metasedimentary rock and a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  These soils are on backslopes of mountains usually on southerly aspects.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 20 inches and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
