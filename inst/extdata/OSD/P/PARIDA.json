  "OVERVIEW": "The Parida series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone and mixed sources.  Parida soils are on hills and ridges and have slopes of 10 to 40 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.",
