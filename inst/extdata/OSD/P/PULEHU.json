  "OVERVIEW": "The Pulehu series consists of well drained soils that formed from alluvium washed from basic igneous rock.  Pulehu soils are on alluvial fans, and stream terraces and in basins and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 74 degrees F.",

Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, and 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 throughout the soil.  The strata of the C horizon range in thickness from less than 1 inch to more than 1 foot, and in texture from sand to silty clay loam.  Some gravel is on the surface and throughout the soil."
