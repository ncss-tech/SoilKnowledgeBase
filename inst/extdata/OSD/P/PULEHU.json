    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 74 degrees F.  In most years, these soils are dry for more than 90 cumulative days in the moisture control section.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, and 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 throughout the soil.  The strata of the C horizon range in thickness from less than 1 inch to more than 1 foot, and in texture from sand to silty clay loam.  Some gravel is on the surface and throughout the soil."

Kekaha soils have a very-fine textured control section and have 5YR or redder hue in the B horizon.  Koele soils have strong structure in the A horizon, mean annual soil temperature of less than 71.6 degrees F., and a fine-silty control section.

The soils formed in alluvium from material weathered from basic igneous rock in the drier areas.  Average annual rainfall is 10 to 35 inches.  The average January temperature is about 72 degrees F., average July temperature is about 78 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is about 74 degrees F."
