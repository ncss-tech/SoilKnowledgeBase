  "OVERVIEW": "The Pololu series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from basalt. Pololu soils are on valley floors. Slopes range from 3 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 78 inches (2000 millimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F (23 degrees C).",
