  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Without altered drainage these soils are saturated in some part between the surface and a depth of 20 inches for 4 to 12 months each year.  The mean annual soil temperature is 61 degrees to 66 degrees F.  Faint to prominent mottles are present in all but the uppermost 5 to 15 inches of the profile.  From a depth of 10 to 30 inches or more the dominant matrix moist chroma is 2 and the dominant moist value is 5.  Hue is 10YR, 5Y or 2.5Y.  Moist mottles have a chroma of 4, 6 or 8 and a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.  Sodium saturation is less than 15 percent in all parts or is less than 15 percent to a depth of 30 inches or more.  The profile is calcareous throughout.  The average texture of the control section is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Strata of minor thickness of loamy sand or sand occur below the control section. Average clay content is about 9 to 14 percent.  Natural drainage prior to reclamation and regional subsidence in the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta may have been better than poorly drained.\nSome pedons have a dark gray to very dark gray upper A horizon as much as 8 inches thick that has about 2 to 50 percent organic matter.  (This horizon is too thin to qualify as a histic or mollic epipedon.  Where formerly present, histic or mollic epipedons have been destroyed or removed by subsidence, plowing or land leveling).\nThe upper part of the A may be 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 3/1, 5/3 or 4/3.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/1, 3/4, 3/1, 4/3 or 3/3.  Textures range from sandy loam to fine sandy loam.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline. The lower part or all of the A horizon is 10YR 5/2, 6/2, 7/2, 7/1; 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2 or 7/2 dry.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2, 4/2, 5/2; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2 or 5/2.  Texture ranges from fine sandy loam, sandy loam, sand, or loamy sand.\nThe Bkq is 10YR 7/1, 7/2; 2.5Y 7/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 6/2, 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2; 5Y 5/2, 5/3.  Textures range from fine sandy loam to sandy loam.  Lime is segregated in the form of few to many seams or soft rounded bodies.  Small to a large portion of this horizon has weak cementation, mostly by calcium carbonate but cementation by silica also seems to be present.\nThe 2C horizon or the soil below the depth of about 40 inches has 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4; 2.5Y 6/2 or 6/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 5/4, 5/3, 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2, 4/2 or 4/4.  It is sand, loamy sand or fine sand, and in most pedons is somewhat stratified and is more sandy than the Bkg horizon."

They formed in sandy or coarse-loamy alluvium mostly from granitic sources along streams in low basins and in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.  The climate is dry subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 9 to 16 inches.  Average July temperature is 74 degrees to 82 degrees F., average January temperature is about 49 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 225 to 300 days."

In the San Joaquin Valley, water tables have been lowered by pumping for irrigation and stream diversion.  Slow to medium runoff.  Moderate slow permeability. Permeability somewhat variable due to varied amount of cementation and pore filling by calcium carbonate.  Saline phases are dependent upon local water management."
