  "OVERVIEW": "The Pleito series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium. Pleito soils are on terraces, fan remnants, erosional remnants and alluvial fans. Slope is 2 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches (28 centimeters) and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degree F. (16.7 degrees C.).",
