These soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum from basalt, cinders, bombs, and volcanic rocks.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December to February.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 170 to 230 days."

The original Official Series Description was updated to reflect current soil taxonomy, to clearly define the range of characteristics, and to improve interpretations.  The central concept, definition, and historical importance of the series were preserved.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nRevised for the correlation of Graham County, AZ, Southwestern Part; March, 2011, WWJ\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
