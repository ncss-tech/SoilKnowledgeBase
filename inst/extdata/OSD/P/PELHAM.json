Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout, except where the surface has been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 through 4.  Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, fine sand, sand or coarse sand.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown and yellow are none to common.  Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, fine sand, sand or coarse sand.\nThe BEg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades yellow and brown and depletions in shades of grey are none to common.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam.\nThe upper part of the Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 through 7.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of yellow, brown and red and depletions in shades of gray range from none to many.  Texture is sandy clay loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon has the same colors and masses of iron accumulation and depletion as the upper part.  Some pedons may have hue of 10YR, value of 5 and chroma of 4 through 8, with common to many depletions.  Texture is usually sandy clay loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam, but ranges to sandy clay.\nThe BCg or Cg horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of yellow or brown and depletion in shades of gray are none to many.  It is usually fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand or sand."

Leagueville soils have chroma of 3 in some part of the E horizon and are better drained.  Alapaha and Blichton soils have more than 5 percent plinthite in some horizons above the 60 inch zone.  In addition, Blichton and Kanapaha soils have a mean average soil temperature of more than 72 degrees F.  Ellabelle and Surrency soils have an umbric epipedon.  Kanapaha and Plummer soils have a sandy epipedon more than 40 inches thick."
