  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 58 degrees F.  The soils are saturated with water all or most of the year.  Depth to mineral soil ranges from 17 to 30 inches.  The organic soil horizons are slightly decomposed in the upper part but below a depth of 12 inches the fiber content visible after rubbing is less than 10 percent.  These horizons are slightly acid to slightly alkaline and are slightly calcareous in the upper few inches of some pedons.  The mineral soil horizons are medium or moderately fine textured.  They are neutral to moderately alkaline and are noncalcareous."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Linwood, Mountainview, Mukilteo, Palms, Peteeneet, Semiahmoo, Shalcar, and Tepete series.  Linwood soils have up to 20 percent coarse woody fragments.  Mountainview soils have one or more layers of mineral soil interstratified with layers of organic soil.  Mukilteo, Peteeneet, and Semiahmoo soils have no mineral layer above a depth of 35 inches.  Palms and Shalcar soils lack relatively undecomposed layers in the upper part.  Also, Shalcar soils are medium acid to extremely acid. Tepete soils have a mean annual temperature colder than 47 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Philbon soils are in level swales or basins in bottomlands and very low terraces.  Elevations range from 2,000 to 5,000 feet.  The organic soil horizons were formed dominantly from the decomposition of rushes, sedges, cattails, bulrushes, and other water loving herbaceous plants.  The mineral soil horizons were formed from mixed alluvium.  The climate has 8 to 25 inches of precipitation and a mean freeze-free period of 100 to 160 days."
