  "OVERVIEW": "The Priestgrade series consists of shallow soils formed from colluvium over residuum from metasedimentary rocks such as phyllite, argillite, schist or slate. The Priestgrade soils are on backslopes, shoulders and summits of high hills, ridges and canyons. Slopes range from 8 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 725 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C.",
