  "OVERVIEW": "The Pyrady series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from mudstone.  Pyrady soils are on broad ridgetops of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 145 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
