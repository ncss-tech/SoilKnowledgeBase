The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay, less than 15 percent (by weight) coarser than fine sand, and has 10 to 20 percent rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  The profile is very strongly acid throughout.  Depth to the 2Bt horizon is 20 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 4 to 6 dry.  It has 27 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 10 percent gravel, and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 4 to 6 dry.  It is gravelly clay loam, clay loam, or gravelly clay with 35 to 45 percent clay.  It has 10 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and dry.  Common fine distinct to many medium prominent redox concentrations occur throughout this horizon.  It is gravelly silty clay loam, gravelly silty clay, or gravelly clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  It has 15 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  The lower portions of this horizon are gleyed.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 5 through 7 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Common coarse to many medium prominent redox concentrations occur throughout the horizon.  It is gravelly clay or gravelly silty clay with 45 to 60 percent clay.  It has 10 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 30 to 40 percent (2 to 5 mm) manganese concretions."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pyrady soils are on metastable broad ridgetops of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from highly sheared mudstone rocks of the Dothan Formation.  Elevations are 2,500 to 3,800 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and warm moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 130 to 160 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 120 days."
