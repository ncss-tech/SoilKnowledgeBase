  "OVERVIEW": "The Pixley series consist of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in mixed alluvium and loess from volcanic ash and extrusive rocks.  Pixley soils are on fan terraces.  Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent.  Average annual precipitation is 360 mm, and average annual temperature is 6.7 degrees C.",
