  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Poplimento series are very deep and well drained with moderately slow permeability.  They formed in residuum from a mixture of shale, limestone, siltstone, and fine sandstone bedrock in the Ridge and Valley portion of the Shenandoah Valley.  Mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches near the type location.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 70 inches. Depth to hard limestone, shale, or siltstone bedrock is greater than 60 inches and varies greatly over short horizontal distances. The content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 55 percent in the A and BA horizons, 0 to 15 percent in the upper part of the Bt horizon, and from 0 to 55 percent in the lower part of the Bt and the C horizons.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid throughout.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Horizons with value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3 are less than 7 inches thick.  The Ap or A horizon is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 8.  It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  The Bt horizon is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay in the fine-earth fraction.  The particle size control section averages more than 35 percent silt and less than 15 percent sand.\nThe BC (where present) and C horizon have colors similar to those of the Bt horizon.  In some pedons, the C horizon is dusky red (2.5YR 3/2) or reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4, 5/4), (5YR 4/3).  They are silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay in the fine-earth fraction."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ebal, Fauquier, Lenberg, Montalto, Needmore, Norton, and Pisgah series.  Ebal soils contain more than 15 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the B horizon and have a lithologic discontinuity within the solum. The Fauquier, Montalto, and Norton soils have hue of 10R or 2.5YR in some part of the Bt horizon.  In addition, Fauquier soils have a solum 20 to 40 inches thick and Montalto soils contain basic igneous rock fragments.  Lenburg soils have a paralithic contact to soft shale within a depth of 40 inches.  Needmore soils have a solum less than 40 inches.  Pisgah soils have less than 35 percent silt or more than 15 percent sand in the particle size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Nonrocky, rocky, and very rocky phases occur in some areas.  These soils formed in material weathered from a mixture of shales, limestone, siltstones, and fine sandstones.  Mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches near the type location.  The growing season ranges from 155 to 200 days."

Duffield soils are fine- loamy.  Nicholson soils have a fragipan.  Hagerstown soils have a redder subsoil. Frederick and Groseclose soils have less than 35 percent base saturation.  Timberville soils occur in slight depressions and at the heads of drains and have thicker surface layers.  Webbtown soils are loamy-skeletal."
