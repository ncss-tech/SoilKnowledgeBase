  "OVERVIEW": "The Pikaden series consist of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on mountain sideslopes. Slopes are 40 to 65 percent. These soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from quartzite and loess. Permeability is moderately rapid. The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 35 degrees F.",
