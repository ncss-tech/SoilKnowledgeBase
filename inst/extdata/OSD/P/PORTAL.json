The depth to carbonates typically ranges from 10 to 28 inches but ranges to 36 inches in some pedons. The A, E and Btn horizons have less than 5 percent rock fragments and the Bk and C horizons have less than 10 percent coarse fragments of mixed lithology.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loamy sand.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loamy fine sand, fine sand, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have a Btnz horizon below a depth of 16 inches.  Some pedons have a Bw horizon below the Btn horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.
