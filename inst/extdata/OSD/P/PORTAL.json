  "OVERVIEW": "The Portal series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on outwash plains.  Permeability is moderately slow in the Btn horizon and moderately rapid below.  These soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits.  Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.",
