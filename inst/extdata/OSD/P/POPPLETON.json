The series control section commonly is fine sand, but sand marginal to fine sand is within the range.  The content of medium sand and coarser ranges from 5 to 30 percent.  The content of coarse and very coarse sand is less than 5 percent of the sand fraction.  The series control section ranges from slightly acid or neutral in the upper part and neutral or slightly alkaline in the lower part.  The soil moisture control section is dry for 20 to 35 consecutive days at some time during the 120 days following the summer solstice in most years.\nSome pedons have an A horizon ranging from 4 to 9 inches in thickness.  The A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The texture is fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.  Reaction is neutral to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR with a value of 4 or 5, and  chroma of 2.  Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or loamy sand.  Reaction is neutral to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have an AB horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3 extending to depths from 10 inches to as much as 16 inches; the soil in this zone contains less than 1 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizons have hue of 10YR with value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Some subhorizon(s) of the B horizon commonly has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y with a chroma of 2.  A prominent feature of this soil is redoximorphic features in the Bw horizon. Redoximorphic features have hue of 7.5YR or yellower.  Texture is fine sand, sand or loamy sand.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, and value of 5 to 7, chroma of 2 to 4.  The texture is sand or fine sand.
