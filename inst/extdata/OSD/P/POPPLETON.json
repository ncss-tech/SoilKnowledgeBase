  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 30 to 70 inches.  The series control section does not have rock fragments.  The series control section commonly is fine sand, but sand marginal to fine sand is within the range.  The content of medium sand and coarser ranges from 5 to 30 percent.  The content of coarse and very coarse sand is less than 5 percent of the sand fraction.  The series control section ranges from slightly acid or neutral in the upper part and neutral or slightly alkaline in the lower part.  The soil moisture control section is dry for 20 to 35 consecutive days at some time during the 120 days following the summer solstice in most years.\nSome pedons have an A horizon ranging from 4 to 9 inches in thickness.  The A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The texture is fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.  Reaction is neutral to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR with a value of 4 or 5, and  chroma of 2.  Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or loamy sand.  Reaction is neutral to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have an AB horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3 extending to depths from 10 inches to as much as 16 inches; the soil in this zone contains less than 1 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizons have hue of 10YR with value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Some subhorizon(s) of the B horizon commonly has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y with a chroma of 2.  A prominent feature of this soil is redoximorphic features in the Bw horizon. Redoximorphic features have hue of 7.5YR or yellower.  Texture is fine sand, sand or loamy sand.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, and value of 5 to 7, chroma of 2 to 4.  The texture is sand or fine sand.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline."

The Aylmer soils are dry for more than 35 consecutive days in the soil moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice in most years.   Hiwood and Lino soils are moderately acid or strongly acid in the series control section.  The Clearriver, Meehan and Rushlake soils contain more than 30 percent medium sand and coarser in the series control section. The Redby soils contain common or many Fe concentrations with hue of 5YR or redder in the B horizon.  Sciota soils are dry for less than 20 consecutive days in the soil moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice in most years.  Winterfield soils have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with increasing depth."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on slightly convex to slightly concave positions on nearly level glacial lake plains.  Slope gradients are less than 3 percent.  They formed mostly in very deep, fine sand, lacustrine deposits of Late Wisconsin age.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 19 to 24 inches.  Frost-free days range from 110 to 140.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 785 to 1000 feet."
