    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F. The color is very dark brown or very dark gray or black. The depth of organic soil over mineral soil ranges from 36 inches to more than 6 feet. The Oa1 layer is slightly to strongly calcareous. Reaction, except for the Oal layer, ranges from slightly acid to neutral (1-5 dilation in H20). Organic matter content is 30 to 100 percent."

They occur as somewhat elongated bodies that are 2 to 4 feet higher in the middle and slope to the outer edges. The climate is dry subhumid The mean annual temperature is 49 to 50 degrees F., and mean summer temperature is 70 degrees F., and an average annual precipitation of 11 to 16 inches. The frost-free period is 120 to 150 days."
