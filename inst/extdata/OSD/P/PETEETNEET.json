  "STATES": "ID,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Peteetneet series consists of deep, very poorly drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in organic materials.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping depressions of low lake terraces and in the low areas of valleys. The mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F., and an average annual precipitation of 14 inches.",

The depth of organic soil over mineral soil ranges from 36 inches to more than 6 feet. The Oa1 layer is slightly to strongly calcareous. Reaction, except for the Oal layer, ranges from slightly acid to neutral (1-5 dilation in H20). Organic matter content is 30 to 100 percent."

The climate is dry subhumid The mean annual temperature is 49 to 50 degrees F., and mean summer temperature is 70 degrees F., and an average annual precipitation of 11 to 16 inches.
