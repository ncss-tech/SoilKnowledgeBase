  "BYREV": "Rev. HFH",
  "REVDATE": "09/2002",
  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Palmetto series consists of deep, poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in unconsolidated marine sandy and loamy materials.  They occur in sloughs, depressions, and poorly defined drainageways in the flatwoods in Peninsular Florida.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.",

Felda soils lack a Bh horizon and have A horizons 20 to 40 inches thick.  Floridana soils have a mollic epipedon, lack a Bh horizon, and have A horizons 20 to 40 inches thick.  Sellers soils have thick umbric epipedons and are sandy to depths of 80 inches or more.  Zephyr soils have a histic epipedon."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Palmetto soils are poorly drained.  Runoff is slow.  Permeability is rapid in the A and Bh horizons and moderately slow in the Bt horizon.  The water table is at depths less than 10 inches for 2 to 6 months in most years.  Water may stand on the surface briefly after heavy rainfall in the rainy season.  Depressions are ponded for 2 to 6 months or more in most year."

In the sloughs natural vegetation is chalky bluestem, blue maidencane, sand cordgrass, pineland threeawn, low panicums, and scattered slash pines and scattered clumps of sawpalmetto.  In depressions native vegetation is sawgrass, maidencane, arrowhead, cattail, spikerush, St. Johnswort, bluestem, bay and cypress in places."
