Reaction of the A and Bh horizons ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid and of the B2t, B3g, and Cg horizons very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe A1 or Ap horizon has hue 10YR, value 1 to 4, and chroma 2 or less; or hue N, value 1 to 4.  Thickness is 8 inches or less where value is 2 or 3.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe A2 horizon has hue 10YR, 2.5Y, or N, value 5 to 7, and chroma\n2 or less with or without mottles or value 5, chroma 2 with\nmottles.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bh&A2 horizon, where present, has colors like those of the component parts.\nThe B2h horizon does not meet the requirements of a spodic\nhorizon.  Color is predominantly hue 10YR, value 3, chroma 2 or 3,\nor value 4, chroma 2 to 4; or hue 7.5YR, value 4, chroma 2 or 4,\nbut ranges to hue 10YR, value 5, chroma 2 to 4 where value of the\nA2 horizon is 7.  Common to many uncoated sand grains are in the\nB2h horizon.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nSome pedons have an A'2 horizon, where present, hue is 10YR or\n2.5Y, value 5 to 7, chroma 3 or less.  Texture is sand or fine\nsand.\nThe B2tg or B'2tg horizon has hue 10YR or 5Y, value 4 to 7, chroma\n1 or 2; hue 2.5Y, value 4 to 7, chroma 1 or 2; hue 2.5Y, value 4\nto 7, chroma 2; or hue N, value 4 to 7 with or without mottles of yellow, brown, red, or gray.  Texture of the control section is\nsandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  In some pedons, texture of the lower B2tg horizon is sandy clay.\nThe B3 or B'3g horizon, where present, has the same color range as that of the B2tg horizon.  Texture ranges from loamy sand to fine sandy loam.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has hue 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value 5\nto 8, chroma 4 or less.  Texture ranges from sand to loamy fine\nsand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Palmetto soils occur in sloughs, depressions, and poorly defined drainageways in the flatwoods of Peninsular Florida.  They formed in thick beds of unconsolidated sandy and loamy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent."

EauGallie, Immokalee, and Oldsmar soils are on higher flatwoods landscapes and have spodic horizons.  In addition, Immokalee soils lack an argillic horizon.  Felda soils lack a Bh horizon and have A horizons 20 to 40 inches thick.  Floridana soils have a mollic epipedon, lack a Bh horizon, and have A horizons 20 to 40 inches thick.  Sellers soils have thick umbric epipedons and are sandy to depths of 80 inches or more.  Zephyr soils have a histic epipedon."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Palmetto soils are poorly drained.  Runoff is slow.  Permeability is rapid in the A and Bh horizons and moderately slow in the Bt horizon.  The water table is at depths less than 10 inches for 2 to 6 months in most years.  Water may stand on the surface briefly after heavy rainfall in the rainy season.  Depressions are ponded for 2 to 6 months or more in most year."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of this soil are in natural vegetation.  Some areas are used for improved pasture.  In the sloughs natural vegetation is chalky bluestem, blue maidencane, sand cordgrass, pineland threeawn, low panicums, and scattered slash pines and scattered clumps of sawpalmetto.  In depressions native vegetation is sawgrass, maidencane, arrowhead, cattail, spikerush, St. Johnswort, bluestem, bay and cypress in places."
