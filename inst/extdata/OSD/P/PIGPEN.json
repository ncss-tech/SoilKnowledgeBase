    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pigpen soils are on earthflows on lower mountain slopes. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. Elevations are 67 to 971 meters (215 to 3185 feet). The soils formed in earthflow colluvium derived from mudstone and sandstone. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1780 to 2290 millimeters (70 to 90 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 16 degree C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 15 degree C (50 to 59 degrees F). Frost free season is about 250 to 280 days."
