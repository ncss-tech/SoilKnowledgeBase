These soils are saturated with water at some period during the year.  The control section contains less than 10 percent coarse fragments and is dominantly clay loam and sandy clay loam.  The soils are slightly acid to neutral becoming less acid with depth.  The mollic epipedon is 24 to 36 inches thick.\nThe A horizon have value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  It has weak granular or blocky structure.\nThe B2g horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist, and is mottled.  It is clay loam or sandy clay loam.  The B2g horizon has weak structure and is massive.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of  1 or 2 dry or moist and is mottled.

Coland soils have mollic epipedons more than 36 inches thick and have 15 to 30 percent fine sand or coarser in the control section.  Comfrey soils have mildly to moderately alkaline C horizons that contain free carbonate.  Glencoe soils have hue of 5Y or 2.5Y in the B horizon. James Canyon soils have gravelly control sections.  Kimmerling soils have 5Y hue in the control section.  McClave soils lack a significant component of volcanic ash in the upper part of the control section. Wenas soils overlie loose, gravelly alluvium at moderate depths."

Peoh soils formed in mixed alluvium.  There is some loess and volcanic ash mixed in the surface layer of the soils and this overlies older heavier textured alluvium.  The soils occur at elevations of 800 to 1,500 feet in a subhumid climate; the mean annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F.; the average annual precipitation is 15 to 25 inches; and the frost free season is 130 to 165 days."
