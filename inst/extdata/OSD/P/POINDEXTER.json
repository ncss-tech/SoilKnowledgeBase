    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 14 to 40 inches.  Depth to weathered bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches and depth to hard rock ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent throughout.  Rock fragments usually consist of quartz in the upper part of the solum and quartz or other acid or basic rocks in the lower part of the solum.  Content of mica ranges from none to many flakes and usually increases with depth.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through neutral throughout unless limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  Eroded areas and some Ap horizons also range to clay loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe BA, BE, and EB horizons, where present, have hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  They are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Some pedons have thin continuous or discontinuous lenses or bodies of clay in the Bt horizon.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, is mottled in shades of brown, yellow, black, red, green, olive, white, and gray.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, or silty clay loam saprolite.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered bedrock that is moderately to very highly fractured.\nThe R horizon is unweathered bedrock that is very slightly to moderately fractured."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Karma, Mocksville, and Teksob series in the same family and the Bremo, Lewisberry, Louisburg, Relay, Saluda, Sekil, Siloam, Spriggs, Wilkes, and Zion series in related families.  Karma, Mocksville and Teksob soils are very deep and, in addition, Karma soils formed on stream terraces in MLRAs 133B, 118A, and 188B and Teksob soils formed in loamy alluvium in MLRA 131.  Bremo soils are mesic, do not have an argillic horizon, and have a depth to hard bedrock of 20 to 40 inches.  Lewisberry, Relay, and Saluda soils are mesic.  Louisburg soils have a cambic horizon and less than 35 percent base saturation.  Sekil soils have a coarse-loamy particle size control section and a depth to hard bedrock of 20 to 40 inches.  Siloam and Wilkes soils have a paralithic contact at depths shallower than 20 inches.  In addition, Shiloam soils are mesic.  Spriggs soils are mesic.  Zion soils are mesic, have a clayey subsoil, and a depth to hard bedrock of 20 to 40 inches."

Slopes are dominantly convex and 8 to 25 percent, but they range from 2 to 60 percent. The Poindexter soils formed in materials weathered from basic rocks or a mixture of acid and basic rocks.  The climate is temperate and humid.  Mean annual temperature is above 57 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 48 inches."
