  "OVERVIEW": "The Padova series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from gneiss and igneous rock sources. Padova soils are on foothills. Slopes range from 15 to 55 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 584 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C.",
