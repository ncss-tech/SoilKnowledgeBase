  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 40 to 70 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 59 to 64 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of about 9 to 27 inches is usually moist all of the time from about the middle of October until about the middle of May and is dry all the rest of the time.  Rock fragments average 10 to 35 percent in the 10 to 40 inches control section.  Most of these fragments are less than 3/4 inch in diameter.  The amount and size of rock fragments increase with depth and most pedons have more than 35 percent rock fragments below a depth of 40 inches.  Organic matter is 1.5 to 2.5 percent in the upper 10 inches and decreases gradually to less than 1 percent at a depth of 20 inches.  The soils are sandy loam or coarse sandy loam throughout and are neutral or slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon is brown, dark brown , or dark yellowish brown (10YR 5/3, 4/3, 4/4) dry and dark brown or very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/3, 3/2; 7.5YR 3/2) moist.\nThe B horizon is brown, dark brown, or strong brown (7.5YR 5/4, 4/4, 5/6, 4/6) dry.  Some pedons have a few thin clay films."

Andregg and San Andreas soils are 24 to 40 inches deep to granitic rocks or sandstone.  Ben Lomond and Junipero soils have a mean annual soil temperature cooler than 59 degrees F. and have a base saturation of 50 to 75 percent in some part of the soil to a depth of 30 inches.  Sheridan soils have a dark colored A horizon with more than 1 percent organic matter to a depth of 20 inches or more."

They formed in material weathered from sandstones, schists, gneiss, and granitic rocks.  The climate is moist subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 55 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.; and the average July temperature is about 75 degrees F.  The frost free season ranges from 225 to 300 days."
