  "OVERVIEW": "The Pfeiffer series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone, schist, gneiss and granitic rocks.  Pfeiffer soils are on uplands and have slopes of 2 to 85 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 36 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 40 to 70 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 59 to 64 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of about 9 to 27 inches is usually moist all of the time from about the middle of October until about the middle of May and is dry all the rest of the time.  Rock fragments average 10 to 35 percent in the 10 to 40 inches control section.  Most of these fragments are less than 3/4 inch in diameter.  The amount and size of rock fragments increase with depth and most pedons have more than 35 percent rock fragments below a depth of 40 inches.  Organic matter is 1.5 to 2.5 percent in the upper 10 inches and decreases gradually to less than 1 percent at a depth of 20 inches.  The soils are sandy loam or coarse sandy loam throughout and are neutral or slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon is brown, dark brown , or dark yellowish brown (10YR 5/3, 4/3, 4/4) dry and dark brown or very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/3, 3/2; 7.5YR 3/2) moist.\nThe B horizon is brown, dark brown, or strong brown (7.5YR 5/4, 4/4, 5/6, 4/6) dry.  Some pedons have a few thin clay films."
