Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragment content, by volume, ranges from 2 to 30 percent in the A horizon, from 5 to 50 percent in individual horizons of the B, and from 30 to 90 percent in the C horizon, the control section average is less than 35 percent. The soil, where unlimed, ranges from extremely through strongly acid in the upper part of the solum, is strongly acid or moderately acid in the lower part of the solum, and ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid in the C horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 10R, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon (where present) has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10R through 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Brecknock, Caribel, Fredericktown, Greencreek (T), Neshaminy, and Weedmark series are in the same family. All of these soils are more than 40 inches from the soil surface to bedrock. The Brecknock series has dominant rock fragments of porcelanite and hornfel channers. The Caribel and Weedmark series receive less than 35 inches of precipitation much of it from snowfall and have hues 5YR or yellower. The Fredericktown series has depths to the base of the argillic horizon of 60 to 100 inches or more and has rock fragments dominated by gravels. The Neshaminy series have sola dominated by diabase rock fragments and colors can range yellower than 5YR. The Greencreek series does not have an OSD available."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Penn soils are on nearly level to steep moderately dissected uplands. Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent. They formed in materials weathered from noncalcareous reddish shale, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone, normally of Triassic age. The climate is humid temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 48 inches, mean annual air temperature ranges from 50 to 59 degrees F, and the frost free season ranges from 170 to 200 days."
