  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the discontinuity ranges from 28 to 35 inches.  The soil is usually moist, but when dry it has cracks ranging from 0.5 to 3 inches in width extending to the very gravelly 2C horizons.  Cracks are open from 90 to 150 days (cumulative) during most years.  The soil is clayey throughout the A, ABss and BC horizons.  The typifying pedon is from a microlow.  Cycles of microlows and microhighs are repeated each 7 to 15 feet.  The thickness of the A and ABss horizons varies from 30 inches in the microlow to 15 inches in the microhigh.  Reaction throughout the A, ABss and BC horizons ranges from neutral in the microlows through mildly alkaline in the microhighs.  Intersecting slickensides are common in the A ABss horizon.\nThe A and ABss horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma 2 through 4.  Texture is clay.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4.  It ranges from clay to gravelly clay.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4.  Texture is very gravelly loam or very gravelly clay loam with 35 to 60 percent by volume of gravel."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aguirre, Cartagena, Fe, Fraternidad, Guanica, and Poncena series in similar subgroups.  Aguirre, Guanica, and Poncena soils are less well drained and have A horizons with colors of lower chroma.  In addition, Poncena soils have a calcic horizon.  The Cartagena, Fe, and Fraternidad soils lack horizons with more than 35 percent gravel within 40 inches of the soil surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Paso Seco soils occur on nearly level to gently sloping alluvial fans.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 5 percent.  The soil formed in fine textured sediments of mixed origin which overlie gravelly medium textured sediments.  The climate is semiarid tropical.  Average yearly rainfall is 30 to 40 inches and mean annual air temperature is 78 to 80 degrees F."
