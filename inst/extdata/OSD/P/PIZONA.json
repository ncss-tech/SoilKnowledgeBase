    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to basaltic bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.   The soil between depths of 12 and 30 inches is usually dry from mid-May until sometime in November, and is moist in some part the rest of the time.  The soil temperature is above 5 degrees C. from April 1 to December 15, and is above 8 degrees C. from April 15 to December 1.  Summer thunderstorms occur, but are spotty and usually do not wet the moisture control section.  The mean annual soil temperature is 8 to 13 degrees C.  Most of the rock fragments are angular or flaggy basaltic fragments.  Rock fragments cover 20 to 60 percent of the soil surface and in many areas project 8 to 50 cm above the soil surface. Surface stone coverage is 3 to 30 percent.  The dry bulk density of the ashy overburden is 1.1 to 1.25 g/cc and the moist bulk density is 1.30 to 1.45 g/cc.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 6/2 or 7/2.  Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 5/2 or 5/3. .  The ashy overburden is 15 to 36 cm thick.  Rock fragment content is 15 to 35 percent, consisting of 5 to 15 percent gravel, 5 to 15 percent cobbles, and 3 to 15 percent stones.  The organic carbon content is 0.1 to 0.3 percent.\nThe 2Ab horizon color is 10YR 6/2, 6/3 or 7/2.  Moist color is 10YR 4/4, 4/2 or 4/3.  Textures are gravelly or cobbly loamy sand or sandy loam.  Rock fragment content is 20 to 35 percent, consisting of 10 to 20 percent gravel, 5 to 10 percent cobbles and 3 to 15 percent stones.\nThe 2Btb horizon color is 10YR 6/2, 6/3 or 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3 or 4/4.  Textures are very cobbly or very stony sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 30 percent. Rock fragment content is 35 to 60 percent, consisting of 10 to 25 percent gravel, 15 to 25 percent cobbles, and 1 to 20 percent stones."

The soils formed in material weathered from basaltic rock, with a subsequent aerial deposition of rhyolitic volcanic ash.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, much of it as snow.  The mean January temperature is about -1 degrees C.; the mean July temperature is about 19 degrees C.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C.  The frost-free season is 110 to 140 days.  Some rock outcrops are associated with these soils."

Cold soil temperatures in winter prevent their meeting all the xeric moisture regime requirements.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
