  "OVERVIEW": "The Pagayvay series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from diorite.  Pagayvay soils are in floodplains and flood plain steps.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

(Bk1 and Bk2 horizons) Based on presence of pedogenic carbonate.\nUstifluventic feature  an irregular decrease in organic carbon is inferred from the landscape position and accompanying flooding.\nSource of carbonates is believed to be from carbonatic dust from surrounding areas.\nThe cambic horizon qualifies because of the increase in carbonates in the Bk2 horizon in relation to the Bk1 horizon.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003"
