(parts of the Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 3 inches.  (A horizons)\nCambic horizon:  The zone from 3 to 60 inches.  (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons) Based on presence of pedogenic carbonate.\nUstifluventic feature  an irregular decrease in organic carbon is inferred from the landscape position and accompanying flooding.\nSource of carbonates is believed to be from carbonatic dust from surrounding areas.\nThe cambic horizon qualifies because of the increase in carbonates in the Bk2 horizon in relation to the Bk1 horizon.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
