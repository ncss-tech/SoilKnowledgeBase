    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The weighted average clay content in the control section ranges from 18 to 25 percent, and silt content from 30 to 45 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is very fine sandy loam or loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It commonly has redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, or gray.  Texture is very fine sandy loam or loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bt/E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Redoximorphic features are in shades of brown, gray, yellow or red and range from few to common.  In some pedons the lower part has a mixed matrix of these colors .  Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.  The E part, or albic materials, make up 5 to about 25 percent.  However, some part of this horizon that is 4 inches or more thick contains 15 percent or more albic materials.  Electrical conductivity ranges from 0 to 4.0 mmho/cm.  Typically, the EC increases with depth.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has matrix colors in shades of gray or brown.  Redoximorphic features or strata in shades of brown, gray, yellow or red range from few to many.  It is shale, mudstone, or stratified layers of these materials with strata of siltstone and sandstone in some pedons.  The texture is mainly clay but some pedons are clay loam.  Electrical conductivity ranges from 2.0 to 8.0 mmho/cm.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral."

Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual temperature ranges from 65 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit.  The average rainfall ranges from 40 to 46 inches and the Thornwaite P-E index ranges from 70 to 76.  The elevation ranges from 230 to 400 feet above sea level.

A perched water table is at a depth of 1.5 to 4 feet during the winter and spring seasons for very brief to brief durations.  The water table is present for a cumulative period of 1 to 2 months during most years."
