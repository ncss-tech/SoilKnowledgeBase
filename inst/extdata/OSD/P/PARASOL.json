  "OVERVIEW": "The Parasol series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on side slopes and foot slopes of volcanic hills and mountains.  They formed in plutonic residuum.  Near the type location, the mean annual air temperature is about 80 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is bout 40 inches.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.",
