The sand fraction of the sandy clay loam consists of 50 to 80 percent fine and very fine sands. Sandy loam texture may occur below a depth of 50 inches. Clay content is 18 to 35 percent. Gypsum crystals are present in some pedons. Bk horizons with segregated carbonates are present in most pedons and calcium carbonate equivalent is less than 5 percent.

The sand fraction of the sandy clay loam consists of 50 to 80 percent fine and very fine sands. Clay content is 18 to 35 percent. Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Panoche series formerly included soils with an aridic bordering on a xeric moisture regime. Such soils will now be within the Polonio series. The Panoche series was historically classified as Typic Torriorthents.  This was changed to Typic Haplocambids when a cambic horizon was describedin the Panoche profile. The presence of a cambic horizon is based on the following characteristic:\n1. Soil structure in the cambic horizon (unless moist from irrigation or rainfall or drastically modified by deep ripping).\n2. Removal of carbonates or gypsum from the cambic horizon.\n3. Accumulation of carbonates or gypsum below the cambic horizon which supports loss of carbonates or gypsum from overlying horizons.\n4. Higher chroma in the cambic horizon in some pedons.\n5. Most areas of Panoche soil are irrigated with 2 to 3 feet of water per year applied for crop production. Previous to irrigation, only about 7 inches of precipitation coupled with flood water, was available for soil development. Movement of carbonates, gypsum, fertilizers, and salt through the soil profile has created more pronounced cambic horizons because of application of irrigation water.\nThe recognition of a cambic horizon in this soil necessitates the placing of all saline-sodic and saline-alkali phases of Panoche series into another soil series. These soils would classify as Sodic Haplocambids. Many of these soils will be called Calflax series. Calflax series has an irregular decrease in organic carbon content with increasing depth, which appears to be the case with soils mapped as Panoche, saline sodic. They also occur on lower positions in the landscape (fan skirts) than Panoche soils, which are not saline-sodic (alluvial fans and flood plains).\nMajor Diagnostic Horizons:\n1.  Ochric Epipedon--0 to 7 inches (Ap).\n2.  Cambic Horizon--7 to 24 inches (Bw).\n2.1 Removal of carbonates or gypsum from the cambic horizon.\n3.  Zone of redistribution--24 to 60 inches (Bk).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
