    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil between the depths of 5 and 15 inches becomes moist in some part in the latter part of December and stays moist until about the end of February or March. It is usually dry the rest of the year. Mean annual soil temperature is about 60 degrees to 66 degrees F. The soil temperature is always above 47 degrees F. Coarse fragments are generally less than 5 percent, though some pedons have thin strata with up to 35 percent below 40 inches. Organic matter is less than 1 percent and decreases regularly with increasing depth.  They generally are calcareous below a depth of 1 to 7 inches.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Panoche series formerly included soils with an aridic bordering on a xeric moisture regime. Such soils will now be within the Polonio series. The Panoche series was historically classified as Typic Torriorthents.  This was changed to Typic Haplocambids when a cambic horizon was describedin the Panoche profile. The presence of a cambic horizon is based on the following characteristic:\n1. Soil structure in the cambic horizon (unless moist from irrigation or rainfall or drastically modified by deep ripping).\n2. Removal of carbonates or gypsum from the cambic horizon.\n3. Accumulation of carbonates or gypsum below the cambic horizon which supports loss of carbonates or gypsum from overlying horizons.\n4. Higher chroma in the cambic horizon in some pedons.\n5. Most areas of Panoche soil are irrigated with 2 to 3 feet of water per year applied for crop production. Previous to irrigation, only about 7 inches of precipitation coupled with flood water, was available for soil development. Movement of carbonates, gypsum, fertilizers, and salt through the soil profile has created more pronounced cambic horizons because of application of irrigation water.\nThe recognition of a cambic horizon in this soil necessitates the placing of all saline-sodic and saline-alkali phases of Panoche series into another soil series. These soils would classify as Sodic Haplocambids. Many of these soils will be called Calflax series. Calflax series has an irregular decrease in organic carbon content with increasing depth, which appears to be the case with soils mapped as Panoche, saline sodic. They also occur on lower positions in the landscape (fan skirts) than Panoche soils, which are not saline-sodic (alluvial fans and flood plains).\nMajor Diagnostic Horizons:\n1.  Ochric Epipedon--0 to 7 inches (Ap).\n2.  Cambic Horizon--7 to 24 inches (Bw).\n2.1 Removal of carbonates or gypsum from the cambic horizon.\n3.  Zone of redistribution--24 to 60 inches (Bk).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
