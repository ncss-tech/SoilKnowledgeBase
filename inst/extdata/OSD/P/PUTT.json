  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a weakly cemented or compacted horizon is from 20 to 34 inches. The base saturation is generally less than 50 percent throughout the profile and ranges form about 20 to 50 percent.  Thickness of the umbric epipedon ranges from 20 to 29 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is between 48o and 55o F. The soil between depths of 10 and 26 inches is usually dry in all parts from late July until late October and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year. Gravel, cobbles and/or stones range from l5 to 60 percent throughout the profile with the textural control section averaging more than 35 percent rock fragments.  Measured clay to 15 bar water ratio is less than 1.25 for the upper 7 inches.  Bulk densities range from about 0.4 to 1.0 g/cc within the upper 40 inches, are less than 0.95 within the upper 7 inches and are greater than 0.85 wininthe upper 14 inches.\nThe A horizon has dry color of lOYR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 5/3; or 7.5YR 3/2 and moist color of lOYR 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 3/3; or 7.5YR 3/2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam and is modified by 15 to 60 percent rock fragments.  It is strongly acid to neutral. Base saturation is 3 to 58 percent.\nThe C horizon has colors of lOYR 5/4, 6/1, 7/lYor 2.5Y 7/4 and moist color of lOYR 3/4, 4/1, 5/1, 5/4, 5/6, 5/8.  Some pedons have common fine distinct mottles which are lOYR 5/8 or 7/6 dry and lOYR 5/8 or 7/8 moist. The upper part is weakly to strongly cemented or compacted and can be broken down to textures of loamy coarse sand, sandy loam or loam. It has 20 to 60 percent rock fragments. It is very strongly acid to slightly acid."

They formed in glacial deposits of Wisconson age derived from mixed sources mainly from the Mehrten formation. Elevations are 3,500 to 6,000 feet. The climate is subhumid mesothermal having a mean annual precipitation which varies from 50 to 70 inches, some of which occurs as snow. Average January temperature is 34o F.; average July temperature is 65 degrees, mean annual temperature is 45 degrees to 51 degrees. Frost-free season is about 100 to 150 days."
