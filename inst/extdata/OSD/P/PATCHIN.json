  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 36 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments, dominantly shale, range from 0 to 10 percent in the upper part of the solum and from 0 to 25 percent in the lower part of the solum, and in the substratum. This includes up to 5 percent rock fragments greater than 3 inches in diameter in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum. Thin subhorizons may contain up to 35 percent shale fragments just above the bedrock. Unless limed, reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout the soil.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam or silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium granular or subangular blocky structure. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 7, and chroma of 2 or less. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate thick to thin platy.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 or less. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam or silty clay loam. The Bg horizon has weak or moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky structure or prismatic parting to blocky. In the lower part, it can have plate-like divisions which are inherited from the weathered bedrock.\nThe BCg horizon has color and texture range similar to the Bg horizon.\nA C or Cr horizon up to 6 inches thick occurs in some pedons. Color range is the same as the B horizon. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is massive, witb or without plate-like divisions."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no known competing series in the same family.\nFremont and Orpark soils are similar soils in a related family. Fremont soils have bedrock at depths greater than 40 inches. Orpark soils have matrix colors dominated with chroma greater than 2 in at least one subhorizon between the base of the Ap and a depth of 30 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Patchin soils occupy depressional areas in bedrock-controlled till uplands. These depressional areas receive surface runoff from adjacent soils. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent, though slopes less than 2 percent dominate. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 56 degrees F., mean annual precipitation from 30 to 45 inches, and the mean frost-free period ranges from 120 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 800 to 1650 feet above sea level."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Most of the shale fragments in the B or C horizons break up during laboratory preparation. Original classification placed Patchin in the subgroup of Aeric Haplaquepts. Because of changes established in the 5th and 6th editions of `Keys to Soil Taxonomy' this soil now classifies in the new subgroup of Typic Endoaquepts. Competing series may change as similar soils are reclassified. Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 14 inches (Ap and E horizon)\n2) Cambic horizon - from 14 to 23 inches (Bg and BCg horizons)\n3) Typic subgroup - as evidenced by the dominance (50% or more) of 2 chroma or less in the matrix of all subhorizons between the base of the Ap horizon and a depth of 30 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
