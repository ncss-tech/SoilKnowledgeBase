  "OVERVIEW": "The Panamaker series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in sandy dredge material from volcanic mudflows.  Panamaker soils are on terraces and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 60 inches and average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages l5 to 30 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregates and 0 to l5 percent rock fragments.  These soils are very strongly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe C horizon has hue of l0YR or 2.5Y, values of 2 to 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.  Textures are stratified and range from fine sand to coarse sand with 0 to 20 percent rock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Panamaker soils are on low river terraces and flood plains along the Toutle River at elevations of 200 to 600 feet.  Panamaker soils formed in sandy dredge material from volcanic mudflows from the May l8, l980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens.  The sandy materials are l0 to 25 feet in depth.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summer, and mild moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 45 to 80 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 200 to 240 days."

Cowlitz soils are somewhat excessively drained soils formed in gravelly dredge spoils.  Mountsolo soils are somewhat poorly drained soils formed in gravelly mudflow material."
