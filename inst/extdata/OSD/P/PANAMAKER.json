The particle-size control section averages l5 to 30 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregates and 0 to l5 percent rock fragments.  These soils are very strongly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe C horizon has hue of l0YR or 2.5Y, values of 2 to 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.  Textures are stratified and range from fine sand to coarse sand with 0 to 20 percent rock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Panamaker soils formed in sandy dredge material from volcanic mudflows from the May l8, l980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens.  The sandy materials are l0 to 25 feet in depth.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summer, and mild moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 45 to 80 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 200 to 240 days."
