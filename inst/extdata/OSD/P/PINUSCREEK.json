  "OVERVIEW": "Pinuscreek series consists of deep, well-drained soils on backslopes to ridges of mountains, formed in volcanic ash over colluvium and residuum from andesitic basalt and andesite. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches and mean annual temperature about 38 degrees F.",
