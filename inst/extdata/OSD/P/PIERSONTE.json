  "OVERVIEW": "The Piersonte series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from shale or schist and mixed with ash. Piersonte soils are mainly on northerly slopes of mountains with slopes of 35 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Depth to fractured shale bedrock is over 60 inches.  Base saturation by sum is over 75 percent throughout the profile.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 35 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 2 or 3 dry and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is ashy loam and has 20 to 40 percent shale fragments in the upper part and 35 to 50 percent in the lower part.\nThe upper part of the Bw horizon has value of 2 through 4 moist, 2 through 4 dry and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is ashy loam or ashy clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay and 50 to 70 percent shale fragments.\nThe lower part of the Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is ashy loam, ashy clay loam or ashy sandy clay loam and has 50 to 80 percent shale fragments."

Bearspring soils contain angular granitic rock fragments.  Cassel soils are deep to a densic contact.  Cherrycreek and Longs soils are deep to basalt (lithic contact).  Eastpine, Egyptcreek, Fredonyer, Midpeak, Mineral, Peahke and Shalrock soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Scoap soils have rounded or subrounded rock fragments.  Skilling and Yellcreek soils have mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick.  Umatilla soils have base saturation less than 75 percent in some part above 30 inches (Ultic)."
