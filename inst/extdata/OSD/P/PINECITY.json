Smithcanyon soils are on cool, higher elevational north-facing slopes and have a typic bordering on xeric soil moisture regime. Desertqueen and Contactmine soils are on similar landscape positions when on hills and mountains, have argillic horizons above a paralithic contact and have a loamy or a fine-loamy, respectively, particle-size control section. Contactmine soils are also moderately deep to the paralithic contact."
