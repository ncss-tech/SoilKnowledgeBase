    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from about 10 to 24 inches.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 16 to 36 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or less.  It is silt loam, silty clay, clay, silty clay loam, clay loam or loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 2 to 4 and 3 to 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or less.  It has few to many distinct or prominent low or high chroma redoximorphic features.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It has thin layers of silty clay or clay in some pedons. It typically contains about 24 to 30 percent clay but ranges from 18 to 35 percent.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  It has moderate or strong grades or medium or fine angular or subangular blocky structure.  Some is weak or moderate prismatic structure parting easily to blocky or platy structure.  Some pedons have a Bkg horizon below a depth of 16 inches.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It has many redoximorphic features with chroma of 1 to 6.  It is silt, silt loam or silty clay loam, and is massive or varved.  Coarser or finer textured sediments are below depths of 40 inches in some pedons.  The Cg horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

The soils formed in calcareous silt loam and silty clay loam lacustrine sediments.  The climate is cool, subhumid.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from about 36 to 48 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation from 15 to 27 inches.  Frost-free period ranges from 90 to 140 days.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 650 to 2350 feet."

Kindred series are on flats and in shallow depressions and swales.  Bearden, Colvin and Overly soils are on slightly higher elevations in the lake plain.  Bearden and Colvin soils have calcic horizons within depths of 16 inches.  Overly soils do not have distinct redoximorphic features within depths of 30 inches and are moderately well drained.  Borup, Gardena and Glyndon soils are on nearby lake plains and are coarse-silty."

Water runs onto these soils and ponds for a time during wet seasons.  Perella soils commonly are too wet to cultivate unless drained.  A wet soil moisture status is at the surface to a depth of 1.5 feet below the surface sometime during the period March through July."
