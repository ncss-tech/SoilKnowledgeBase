  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The amount of gravel and cobble in the soil ranges from 35 to as much as 80 percent of the volume.  The fine earth is loam, sandy loam or clay loam with less than 35 percent clay.  The thickness of the very gravelly soil ranges from 40 inches to several feet.  This soil rests on sandstone or shale bedrock or on fine earth alluvium and glacial till.  Hue ranges from 10YR through 5Y. The average summer soil temperature ranges from 55 to 59 degrees F.  After mixing the surface 7 inches the dry soil color value is greater than 5.5.  There usually is no free lime in the upper few inches of dark colored soil.  Free lime lightly coats sand, gravel and cobbles in part of the C horizon but increase in amount of lime is estimated to be less than 5 percent."

Garlet soils are noncalcareous and have translocated clay and silt coating gravel and cobble in thin bands in a cambic horizon.  Merino and Tropal soils have hard bedrock at depths shallower than 20 inches, also Tropal soils have more than 40 percent CaC03 in the whole soil.  Mirabal soils have summer soil temperatures warmer than 59 degrees F.  Stecum soils have sand filling interstices between coarse fragments.  Utica and Whitore soils have calcic horizons and more than 40 percent CaC03 in the whole soil ______________."

At the type location the soil material is derived mainly from argillite, quartzite and limestone rocks in the Lewis Range.  Mean annual temperature is 39 to 40 degrees F.  Precipitation ranges from 15 to 20 inches annually."
