  "OVERVIEW": "The Poguepoint series consists of deep, well-drained soils on backslopes of mountains.  Poguepoint soils are formed in volcanic ash over colluvium from andesitic basalt. Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
