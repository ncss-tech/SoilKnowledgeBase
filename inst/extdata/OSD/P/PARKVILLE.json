    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  Free carbonates are typically throughout the profile.  The mollic epipedon averages between 10 and 20 inches in thickness.\nThe Ap or upper part of the A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The lower part of the A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or very fine sand and typically has thin strata of finer or coarser-textured material in the lower part of the control section. It ranges from mildly to moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Leta series in the same family and the Blencoe, Kimo, Myrick, Onawa, Percival, and Riley series.  Leta soils have clayey textures to greater depths.  Blencoe soils are noncalcareous above a depth of 30 inches.  Kimo soils are not calcareous in their upper part and have thicker dark-colored surfaces. Myrick soils are saturated with water for significant periods.  Onawa soils lack a mollic epipedon.  Percival soils are clayey over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Riley soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Parkville soils formed in deep, calcareous recent alluvium on flood plains of major streams.  The clayey surface material is 12 to 20 inches in thickness and is underlain by loamy alluvium up to 10 or more feet in thickness.  Slope gradients are from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 42 inches."

Haynie, Kenmoor, Modale, and Sarpy soils are lighter colored.  Waldron soils are clayey throughout the control section.  Haynie,Kenmoor and Sarpy soils are closer to the streams.  Leta, Modale and Waldron soils are on similar positions.  Myrick soils are in depressional areas."
