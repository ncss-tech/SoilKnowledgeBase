Devaul soils are deep to paralithic contacts.  Heechee soils have the base of the argillic horizon at 69 to 100 cm from the soil surface.  Glideski and Wambolt soils are moist in the upper part of the moisture control section for 10 to 20 cumulative days from precipitation received between July and October. Holmes soils have the base of the argillic horizon at 41 to 81 cm from the soil surface and have sandy textures within 100 cm of the soil surface.  Horrocks soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Hoskin and Valmar soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Howcan soils have the base of the argillic horizon at 64 to 100 cm from the soil surface. Longday soils have more than 60 percent rock fragments throughout the argillic horizons and lack secondary carbonates."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pequop soils are on hills, mountains, and fan remnants.  They typically occur of north-facing backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from rhyolite, tuff, and similar volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,525 to 2,505 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 330 to 380 mm, mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 75 to 100 days."

Quarz soils are clayey-skeletal and moderately deep to lithic contacts.  In addition, all of these soils have an aridic moisture regime."
