  "OVERVIEW": "The Parkay series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, or residuum derived from intermediate and basic igneous rocks or from mixed rock sources.  Parkay soils are on mountains, hills, plateaus, structural benches and fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches (53 cm) and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F (3.9 degrees C).",

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Type location was moved in 9/2009 to Sevier County, Utah to be located in an area with less summer precipitation and more in line with original xeric concept.\nChanges in the definition of the series control section and inclusion of the soil moisture regime in the series concept will make a thorough review of the use the Parkay series a necessity in MLRA updates. The Parkay soil mapped in New Mexico needs future recorrelation to another series. The soils mapped as Parkay in MLRA 25 appear to be outside the series range in soil depth and may need future recorrelation as well. Parkay mapped in Wyoming is a family level component; it was dropped from the range of distribution for this series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 30 inches (76 cm) (A, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 8 to 30 inches (20 to 76 cm) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 8 to 28 inches (20 to 71 cm) (Bt1 horizon and part of the Bt2 horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
