  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is more than 40 inches deep. The solum is usually 18 to 29 inches thick and ranges from 10 to 29 inches thick. The mollic epipedon is less than 20 inches thick. The average annual soil temperature is less than 47 degrees F. and the average summer temperature at 20 inches is 60 to 65 degrees F. These soils are usually moist but are dry in the 7 to 20 inch depth for more than 60 consecutive days.\nThe Al horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Modally it is noncalcareous but ranges from 0 to 10 percent lime.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is clay loam to heavy silty clay loam with 20 to 50 percent cobble and gravel (modally 30 to 40 percent).  It has 0 to 15 percent CaC03 equivalent but is mainly less than 10 percent. The lime occurs as nodules, or soft limestone fragments. The B3ca horizon is moderately to strongly calcareous, and mildly to strongly alkaline. The Cca horizon is sandy loam to clay loam, averaging less than 35 percent clay in the 10- to 40-inch section. It is strongly to very strongly calcareous."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Araveton, Aspen, Jacoby, and Ridge- crest series. Araveton soils have loam B2 horizons. Aspen soils are underlain at about 30 inches with loose gravelly sandy materials. Jacoby soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Ridgecrest soils have more than fifty percent coarse fragments in the control section and are less than 40 inches deep to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Picayune soils occur at elevations of 5,200 to 7,200 feet above sea level on steep or very steep mountain slopes with gradients of 15 to 70 percent slopes. These soils formed in medium textured colluvium or local alluvium derived mainly from limestone parent rocks. The climate is moist subhumid having mean annual temperatures of about 43 to 45 degrees  F., an average summer temperature of 62 to 65 degrees F. and an average annual precipitation of 18 to 20 inches."
