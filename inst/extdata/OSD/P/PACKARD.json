    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F.  The soil is usually moist but is dry throughout the control section for 45 to 70 consecutive days during a four month period following the summer solstice.  Depth to bedrock is over 60 inches and the sola is 24 to 40 inches thick.  The control section has an average of 35 to 50 percent rock fragments, mainly gravel and 25 to 35 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon is 24 to 40 inches thick.  It is medium to slightly acid throughout the soil.  The A and B horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  It has 15 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 moist to 20 inches or more and 3 or 4 below 20 inches, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It is gravelly or very gravelly clay loam or very gravelly loam.  It has 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 20 to 40 percent gravel.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is extremely or very gravelly clay loam or extremely gravelly loam with 35 to 60 percent gravel and 10 to 25 percent cobbles.  Some pedons have faint to distinct redoximorphic features below 30 inches."
