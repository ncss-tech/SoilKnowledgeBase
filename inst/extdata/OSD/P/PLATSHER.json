  "OVERVIEW": "The Platsher series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from gravelly alluvium and sedimentary shales.  These soils are on nearly level to sloping relict terraces.  Slopes are simple and range from 0 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 19 inches thick.  Depth to continuous horizons of carbonate accumulation ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F.  The soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days following mid-July in most years.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the A and Bt horizons and from 15 to 35 percent in the 2Bk horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline. An E horizon may be present in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The upper part of this horizon is typically part of the mollic epipedon.  Texture is typically clay and less typically clay loam with 35 to 55 percent clay and more than 15 but less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The Bt horizon is typically free of carbonates, but some pedons may be slightly effervescent in the lower part.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is clay loam with 27 to 40 percent clay.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate ranges from 10 to 30 percent.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is gravelly clay loam or gravelly loam with 20 to 32 percent clay.  Calcium carbonate ranges from 15 to 35 percent and decrease with depth.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
