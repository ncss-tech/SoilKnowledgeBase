  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Pamlico soils have 16 to 51 inches of organic material over dominantly sandy sediments.  Reaction is extremely acid (less than 4.5 in 0.01 M calcium chloride) in the organic layers, and ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the underlying mineral layers.\nThe Oi or Oe horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or it is neutral, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 0 to 2.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or it is neutral, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 0 to 2.  Fiber content is 10 to 33 percent unrubbed and less than 10 percent after rubbing.  Structure is coarse granular or massive.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or it is neutral, value of 2 to 6, chroma of 0 to 2.  The weighted average of the upper 12 inches of the Cg horizon, or of the part of the Cg horizon that is within a depth of 51 inches, whichever is thicker, is sandy.  Textures are typically sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand, but may also be mucky analogs of the same fine earth textures in some pedons.  In some pedons, thin subhorizons of the Cg within a depth of 51 inches are loamy.  Textures are typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Below a depth of 51 inches, texture is variable, typically ranging from sand to sandy clay loam."

Belhaven, Ponzer, and Scuppernong soils have mixed mineralogy and are underlain by dominantly loamy mineral soil material.  Croatan soils are underlain by dominantly loamy mineral material.  Currituck soils are less acid and have mixed mineralogy. Dare and Dorovan soils have organic layers more than 51 inches thick."

These soils are formed in decomposed organic matter overlying dominantly sandy mineral sediments.  The mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F. and the annual precipitation is 48 inches near the type location."

The native vegetation consists of pond pine, tupelo gum, sweetbay, gumtrees, cypress, greenbrier, wax myrtle bushes, with undergrowth of gallberry and cut bamboo briers.  These soils are used for improved pasture, corn, soybeans, oats, truck crops, and other cultivated crops when drained."
