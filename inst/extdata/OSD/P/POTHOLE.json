    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pothole soils occur in kettles on fan remnants and outwash plains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in glaciofluvial material with an influence of ash in the surface.  Elevations are 1,370 to 1,490 meters.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 355 to 510 millimeters and the mean temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C.  The frost free period is 30 to 80 days."

Choptie soils are shallow to tuffaceous sandstone bedrock and are on isolated fan remnants.  Daxty soils are loamy-skeletal, are moderately deep to tuffaceous sandstone, and are on low hills.  Herberger soils are in the fine family, are moderately deep to a densic layer, and are found on fan remnants.  Keerins soils are loamy-skeletal, shallow to shale bedrock, and are on rolling hills.  Luckycreek soils are fine-loamy and are on terraces.  Silvies soils are in the fine family and are on floodplains.  Sylvaille soils are loamy, shallow to densic layer, and are found on fan remnants with Pothole soils."
