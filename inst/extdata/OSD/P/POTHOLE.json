  "OVERVIEW": "The Pothole series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in glaciofluvial material with an influence of ash in the surface horizons.  They are found in kettles surrounded by glaciofluvial deposits on fan remnants and outwash plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 17 inches (430 millimeters), and the mean annual temperature is 6 degrees C.",

Herberger soils are in the fine family, are moderately deep to a densic layer, and are found on fan remnants.  Keerins soils are loamy-skeletal, shallow to shale bedrock, and are on rolling hills.  Luckycreek soils are fine-loamy and are on terraces.  Silvies soils are in the fine family and are on floodplains.  Sylvaille soils are loamy, shallow to densic layer, and are found on fan remnants with Pothole soils."
