  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum is 24 to 48 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 14 to 23 inches in thickness.  Depth to the contrasting loamy textures ranges from 18 to 30 inches. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral in the A and 2Bw horizons and moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the 2C horizon.\nThe Ap and A horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of  2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Clay content averages 35 to 50 percent.  Some pedons have a Bw horizon with the colors and texture similar to the A horizon.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Redoximorphic accumulations and depletions are in shades of brown and gray.  Texture is clay loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam.\nThe 2BC and 2C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Redoximorphic accumulations and depletions are in shades of brown and gray.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, fine sand, or sand."

Series in similar families are the Bowdre and Cooter series, Bowdre soils are somewhat poorly drained and occur below the Phillipy soils on nearly level to slightly depressional landscape positions.  Cooter soils have sandy textures immediately below the clayey surface horizons and occur on nearly level to depressional areas."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The soil formed in clayey alluvium in the upper 1.5 to 2.5 feet and the underlying loamy sediments. Most areas are protected from flooding by levees. Mean annual precipitation is about 52 inches and mean annual temperature is 59 degrees Fahrenheit near the type location."

All these soils, except for Bardwell and Ware, are at lower elevations on the flood plain.  Bardwell soils are fine-silty and are on similar positions as the Phillippy soils.  Bondurant soils have clayey textures to 3.5 feet and are somewhat poorly drained.  Commerce soils are fine-silty and somewhat poorly drained. Keyespoint soils are somewhat poorly drained and do not have a mollic epipedon.  Openlake soils are somewhat poorly drained, clayey throughout, and do not have a mollic epipedon. Tunica soils are poorly drained and are below the Phillippy soils on nearly level to depressional landscape positions. Ware soils are on similar landforms but do not have clayey textures in the upper part and are coarse-loamy."

Permeability of the clayey upper part is slow and moderate to moderately rapid in the underlying layers. A seasonal water table fluctuates between a depth of 2.0 and 4.0 feet during late winter and early spring. Unless protected by levees, this soil is subject to flooding."
