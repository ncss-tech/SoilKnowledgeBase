  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Peters soils are on linear to concave footslope and toeslope positions on low hills, slight depressions, and saddles between higher hillslope positions. Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. Gilgai microrelief is present in some areas. The soils formed in colluvium or residuum derived from basic tuff (andesitic)that was deposited by wind or water or both, primarily associated with the Mehrten formation.  The grain size distribution of these volcaniclastic rocks is dominantly sand sized, but there can be layers with volcanic conglomerate or andesitic coarse fragments. Gravel and cobbles in the soil profile are commonly lag deposits from remnant Pleistocene stream terraces associated with the overlying Arroyo Seco or China Hat formations. Elevations range from 35 to 370 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 365 to 725 mm. Mean annual air temperature is 15 to 17 degrees C. Mean January air temperature is about 8 degrees C, and mean July air temperature is 25 to 27 degrees C. Frost-free season is 295 to 340 days."

Amador and Gillender soils are on hills with mound and swale microrelief, form in acidic tuff, have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and have dry color values of 6 or more. Daulton soils form on hills in slate and have a lithic contact between 50 and 100 cm. Hadselville and Pentz soils form in basic tuff on mounds on hills with mound and swale microrelief, and have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Redding soils are on dissected fan remnants, have an argillic horizon, and a duripan of a depth of 50 to 100 cm. Keyes soils are on fans, stream terraces and hills, have an argillic horizon, and a duripan within 50 cm. Newville soils are on dissected fan remnants associated with the Tehama formation and have an argillic horizon.  Redding soils are on dissected fan remnants, have an argillic horizon, and a duripan between 50 to 100 cm."

The unclassified Raynor series fits this deeper concept. The Peters soils as mapped in the 1940 Stockton Area report have some depths less than 20 inches and some more than 20 inches. The latter would be excluded from this concept. The Peters as mapped in the 1967 Tehama County report have a lithic contact and would be excluded from this concept.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNASIS User Pedon ID: 1964CA099032\nPedon Purpose: Soil survey inventory\nSoil classified using the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
