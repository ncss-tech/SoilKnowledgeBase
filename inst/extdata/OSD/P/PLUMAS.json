The Dehlinger soils have a mollic epipedon that is 20 to 35 inches thick and have 18 to 30 percent clay in the control section.  The Drit soils have a mollic epipedon that is 20 to 38 inches thick and the moisture control section is dry 90 consecutive days.  The Gamboa soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a lithic contact and havea mean annual soil temperature of 54 degrees to 58 degrees F.  Langrell soils are only dry for 60 to 80 days following the summer solstice and are very cobbly or extremely cobbly.  The Packard soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 52 degrees to 57 degrees F and have 25 to 35 percent clay in the control section.  The Wrentham soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to hard bedrock."
