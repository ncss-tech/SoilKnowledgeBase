  "OVERVIEW": "The Percell series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on dissected, loess-covered lake plains. They formed in loess and the underlying lacustrine deposits. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1168 mm (46 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
