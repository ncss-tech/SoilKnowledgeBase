  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:   Solum thickness ranges from 40 to about 70 inches to chert and cherty limestone.  A few stones and boulders occur throughout some pedons.\nThe A1 horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The fine earth fraction is fine sandy loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Coarse fragments comprise 35 to 60 percent by volume with 0 to 15 percent larger than 76 mm.  Reaction is slightly acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe A2 horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 8, and chroma of 3 through 6.  The fine earth fraction is fine sandy loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam.  Coarse fragments comprise 40 to 85 percent by volume with 5 to 20 percent larger than 76 mm.  Reaction is strongly acid through neutral.\nThe B2t horizons ranges in hue from 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value from 4 through 6, and chroma from 4 through 8.  The fine earth fraction is clay or sandy clay with a clay content of 37 to 60 percent.  The B21t horizon contains from 40 to 90 percent coarse fragments and the B22t horizon contains from 50 to 90 percent coarse fragments.  Both horizons have from 5 to 20 percent larger than 76 mm included in the coarse fragments.   Reaction is strongly acid or medium acid.  The boundary between the B22t horizon and the R layer ranges from gradual to diffuse.\nThe R layer consists of weakly consolidated chert gravel, cobbles, stones and boulders and cherty dolomite that is weathered and fractured in the upper part and rapidly becomes indurated bedrock with depth."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Riesel series in the same family and the Bexar, Bonti, Castell, Nocken, Rosanky, Rumple, Scullin, Travis, and Voca series.  Riesel soils are formed in alluvial gravelly sediments.  Bexar and Rumple soils are underlain by limestone at depths of less than 40 inches.  Bonti, Chigley, and Scullin soils contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  In addition, Scullin soils have mollic epipedons.  Castell soils contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments and are 20 to 40 inches deep over gneiss.  Nocken soils are 20 to 40 inches deep over sandstone.  Rosanky and Travis soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Voca soils developed from weathered granite and contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments, except for the lower part of the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pebblepoint soils are on complex slopes on uplands.   Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  The soil formed in residuum from chert and dolomitic limestone uplifted in an irregular to oblong pattern. Outcrops of chert cobbles, stones, and boulders are common on ridge crests, which are usually 30 to 50 yards wide, and on the hillsides below.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 64 degrees to 67 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 34 inches.  Thornthwaite P-E indices ranges from 38 to 50."

Rumple, Roughcreek, and Tarpley soils are on adjacent uplands and are underlain with limestone.  Roughcreek and Tarpley soils have sola less than 20 inches thick.  Leeray and Sagerton soils are in broad valleys or on outwash plains and contain less than 15 percent coarse fragments.  In addition, Leeray soils are clayey throughout and have intersecting slickensides."
