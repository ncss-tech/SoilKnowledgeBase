  "OVERVIEW": "The Peaviner series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountain meadows and basins of mountain valley floors. Peaviner soils are formed in colluvium with an influence of volcanic ash overlying residuum of andesitic tuff and tuff breccia.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
