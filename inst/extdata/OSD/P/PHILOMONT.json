  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Philomont series are very deep and well drained.  They formed in residuum weathered from gneissic and granitic rocks in the Blue Ridge uplands that have been intruded and sheared with basic greenstones.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",

Coarse fragments of quartz and gneiss range from 0 to 35 percent in the Ap, Bt, BC, and C horizons.  Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam in the fine earth fraction.  The control section averages less than 18 percent clay.\nThe BC or BCt horizon, where present, is variegated gneissic material.  It is sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon is variegated weathered gneiss often intruded with thin lenses of basic greenstone.  It is sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction and often has thin layers of clay loam or clay."

Brentsville and Tankerville soils are moderately deep over lithic or paralithic materials.  Dunellen soils have stratified sand and gravel within 40 inches of the surface.  Ridgely soils have a thicker solum."

Tankerville and Catoctin soils are on similar landforms and are shallower to lithic or paralithic contact.  Purcellville soils are on gently sloping ridgetops and contain more than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Swampoodle soils are in adjacent upland drainageways and are moderately well drained."

A small area is in woodland.  Corn is the principle row crop.  Fescue, orchard grass, and red clover are typical pasture mixes.  Native vegetation is upland hardwood forest with some bluegrass in open areas."
