  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the C horizon typically ranges from 20 to 45 inches, but can range from 16 to 51 inches. Some pedons have layers of mucky peat within the sapric material of the subsurface and bottom tiers. The combined thickness of the hemic material is less than 10 inches. The fibers are derived mostly from woody fragments. Coarse woody fragments range from less than 1 percent to 20 percent by volume. The reaction ranges from ultra acid to extremely acid throughout the organic layers and from extremely acid to strongly acid in the C horizon.\nThe surface tier has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, or neutral, and chroma of 0 to 2 on broken face and rubbed. Rubbed fiber content is less than 10 percent by volume.\nThe subsurface tier has hue of 2.5YR or 10YR, or neutral; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 3 on broken face and rubbed. The structure of this layer is typically massive, but can contain moderate coarse granular, blocky, or platy structure in varying degrees.\nThe bottom tier where apparent has similar colors of the subsurface tier. The structure is massive and can have up to 15 percent mineral material by volume.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5GY, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 2. It ranges from fine sandy loam, sandy loam, silt loam or loam. Rock fragments range from 35 to 65 percent by volume from the top of the mineral soil to a depth of 70 inches. There can be layers of sandy loams with less than 35 percent rock fragments that combine for no more than 15 inches thick. Some pedons have buried organic layers within the Cg, and other Cg horizons can be dense basal till."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other soils within this family.\nClose relatives of this series are Andersontown, Manahawkin, and Swansea soils. Anderson soils have organic materials less than 51 inches deep over loamy mineral material. Manahawkin soils are over either sandy or sandy-skeletal siliceous mineral material, and Swansea are organics over sandy or sandy-skeletal material. Palms and Linwood are soils in related families with Euic reactions."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Paupack soils are on lake plains, till plains, moraines, or behind glacially blocked drainageways. They have formed in shallow lakes or ponds that range in size from 5 to 100 acres or more. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 50 inches and is evenly distributed throughout the year. Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F., and the growing season ranges from 110 to 200 days."
