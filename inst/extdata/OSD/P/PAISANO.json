Infantry and Sutherland soils are inactive. Neso soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 59 to 62 degrees F. In addition, Neso soils are in the Pecos-Canadian Plains and Valleys (MLRA 70) and are moist in May and June. Orrubo soils have Cr horizons below the hardpan at depths between 17 and 30 inches. Ferrogold and Philder soils have petrocalcic horizons from 14 to 20 inches.  Ferrogold, Orrubo, Sequite, Wechech, and Wodovar soils are in the Mohave Desert receive mostly winter precipitation and are usually dry from April through November. Tencee soils are drier in the control section for longer periods (typic/aridic). Wodavar soils have rock fragments that are mostly lime nodules and formed in lacustrine sediments."
