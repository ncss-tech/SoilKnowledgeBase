  "OVERVIEW": "The Pahrange series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived mainly from rhyolitic rock.  Pahrange soils are on mountains and have slopes of 15 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
