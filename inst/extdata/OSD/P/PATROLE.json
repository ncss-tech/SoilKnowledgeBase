    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Patrole soils occupy nearly level flood plains.  Slopes are 1 percent or less.  The soil formed in recent stratified alluvium consisting of silty over clayey sediments that are several feet thick.  The climate is arid to semiarid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 16 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 68 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 210 to 240 days and elevation ranges from 2,250 to 3,000 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices are less than 25."

Gila soils do not have contrasting textures and occur away from the flood channel. Harkey soils have a coarse-silty control section and are on similar positions.  Toyah soils have a fine-loamy control section and mollic epipedons. They are on uplands in water-receiving positions."

(A horizon)\nFluventic feature - Has an irregular decrease in organic matter content with depth.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.\nWhen the competing series section was updated in September 2001, questions were raised about the description and/or the classification of this series. It was suggested that this soil should classify in the subgroup of Fluventic Haplocambids or Sodic Haplocambids. A field study of the type location is recommended to resolve the questions.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
