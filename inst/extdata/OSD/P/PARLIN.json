  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent.  Depth to calcareous material normally ranges from 10 to 40 inches.  Depth to the loamy-skeletal material ranges from 15 to 40 inches.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate ranges from 12 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and from 35 to 80 percent in the lower part of the solum or the IIC horizon.  They are mainly 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter in the solum and are mainly 10 to 24 inches in diameter in the IIC horizon but are channery or flaggy in some pedons.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges 56 to 59 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is typically gravelly heavy clay loam or gravelly clay and the fine earth fraction has 35 to 50 percent clay, 5 to 40 percent silt and 15 to 55 percent sand, with more than 15 percent being fine or coarser sand.  This horizon ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine earth fraction and has less than 35 percent clay.  This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline."

The soils formed in locally transported sediments from rhyolite or similar rock.  The average annual precipitation is 15 to 17 inches, with peak periods of precipitation is 15 to 17 inches, with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and summer.  The mean annual temperature is 36 to 42 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 55 to 60 degrees F."
