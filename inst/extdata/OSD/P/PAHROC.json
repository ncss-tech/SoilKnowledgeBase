  "OVERVIEW": "The Pahroc series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Pahroc soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.",
