    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pahroc soils are on fan remnants that have been dissected by intermittent drainage channels.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium derived from ignimbrite, dolomite, limestone, quartzite, sandstone, and shale.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,070 to 1,830 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 12 to 15 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 160 to 180 days."

Bastian soils lack duripans but contain durinodes and are somewhat poorly drained.  Geer soils lack duripans and coarse-loamy particle-size control sections.  Leo soils are sandy-skeletal, very deep, and do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons."
