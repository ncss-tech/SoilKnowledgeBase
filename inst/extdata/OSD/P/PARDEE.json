Where there is mound and swale topography, Pardee soils occur on the mound positions. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. They formed in dark metamorphic and quartzitic gravelly and cobbly alluvium from mixed sources overlying unrelated volcaniclastic or metamorphic bedrock. Elevation ranges from 35 to 320 meters. Climate is Mediterranean with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 465 mm to 660 mm. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 16 to 17 degrees C. Mean January air temperature is about 8 degrees C, and mean July air temperature is 25 to 26 degrees C. The frost-free season ranges from 325 to 355 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 23 cm (A1 and A2 horizon).\nArgillic horizon: 23 to 46 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and 2Bt3 horizon).\nLithic contact: 46 cm (2R horizon)\nParticle size control section for this pedon: 23 to 46 cm\nThis pedon was sampled by the SCS Riverside Laboratory in 1960 as pedon number 60 CA-3-22-(1-6) and is published in the California SSIR No. 24, pages 70 and 71. It was also sampled in Sacramento County as S82 CA 067-004. Where there is very slight hummocky microrelief, a complex has not been mapped (Amador County). Where there is strong hummocky microrelief a mound, intermound complex has been mapped with Pardee soils occurring on the mound position and Ranchoseco soils in the intermound position (Sacramento and Yuba counties). Soils with solum thickness greater than 50 cm have been excluded in this revision.\nEdit notes 12/2018\nThe OSD pedon was described with a consolidated C horizon composed of andesitic conglomerate. Although this is the case, this horizon has been treated as a lithic contact in the series and component where this pedon is used as representative. Future investigations should evaluate if the bedrock is cemented at the type location and across its mapped extent.\nMLRA assignment changed from 17 (Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys) to 18 (Sierra Nevada Foothills) because this is a bedrock-controlled soil in a bedrock-dominated landscape, which conforms to the definition of MLRA 18.\nADDITION DATA:\nNASIS User Pedon ID: S1960CA005022\nPedon Purpose: Laboratory sampling site\nLab Pedon #: 40A2866\nLab Source ID: SSL\nSoil classified using the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
