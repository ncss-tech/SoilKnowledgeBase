It was also sampled in Sacramento County as S82 CA 067-004. Where there is very slight hummocky microrelief, a complex has not been mapped (Amador County). Where there is strong hummocky microrelief a mound, intermound complex has been mapped with Pardee soils occurring on the mound position and Ranchoseco soils in the intermound position (Sacramento and Yuba counties). Soils with solum thickness greater than 50 cm have been excluded in this revision.\nEdit notes 12/2018\nThe OSD pedon was described with a consolidated C horizon composed of andesitic conglomerate. Although this is the case, this horizon has been treated as a lithic contact in the series and component where this pedon is used as representative. Future investigations should evaluate if the bedrock is cemented at the type location and across its mapped extent.\nMLRA assignment changed from 17 (Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys) to 18 (Sierra Nevada Foothills) because this is a bedrock-controlled soil in a bedrock-dominated landscape, which conforms to the definition of MLRA 18.\nADDITION DATA:\nNASIS User Pedon ID: S1960CA005022\nPedon Purpose: Laboratory sampling site\nLab Pedon #: 40A2866\nLab Source ID: SSL\nSoil classified using the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
