  "OVERVIEW": "The Paintcreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in 13 to 51 centimeters (5 to 20 inches) of loess over clayey pedisediment and the underlying residuum from dolomite. These soils are on side slopes, nose slopes, and head slopes on dissected uplands. Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 79 centimeters (31 inches).",
