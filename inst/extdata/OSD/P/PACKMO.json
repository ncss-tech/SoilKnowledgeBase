  "OVERVIEW": "The Packmo series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately  permeable soils on outwash fans and fan terraces.  They formed in mixed  alluvium.  They have slopes of 1 to 20 percent.  The average annual  precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is  about 38 degrees F.",
