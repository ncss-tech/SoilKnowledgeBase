  "OVERVIEW": "The Pingree series consists of very shallow, well drained  soils formed in loess and material weathered from basalt.  Pingree soils are on lava flows on slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  Average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
