  "OVERVIEW": "The Pleitito series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary and/or granitoid rock. Pleitito soils are on alluvial fans and flood plains. Slope is 1 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 229 mm (9 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C (64 degrees F).",
