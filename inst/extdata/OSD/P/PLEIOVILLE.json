  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pleioville soils are on plains.  Slopes are 3 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 7,400 to 8,000 feet.  These soils formed in gravelly local alluvium derived from volcanic conglomerates and tuff.   The average annual precipitation is about 14 to 19 inches; the average annual temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 120 days. In Colorado slopes range as high as 65 percent and also occur on backslopes."
