  "OVERVIEW": "The Pleioville series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly local alluvium derived from volcanic conglomerates and tuff.  They are on plains.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The average annual precipitation is about 14 to 19 inches; the average annual temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 120 days. In Colorado slopes range as high as 65 percent and also occur on backslopes."
