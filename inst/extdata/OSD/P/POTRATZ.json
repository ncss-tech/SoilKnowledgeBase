  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 54 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature at a depth of 20 inches from 65 degrees to 72 degrees F. The soils are usually dry, but are moist for 60 to 80 consecutive days in late winter and spring. Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. Depth to the Cca horizon is 8 to 20 inches. Few fine basalt pebbles are distributed throughout the profile; and some areas are cobbly or stony. The section between depth of 10 inches and the bedrock averages 18 to 27 percent clay, more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand, and less than 35 percent rock fragments. The hue is chiefly 10YR, but ranges 2.5Y.\nThe A and B horizons range from neutral to moderately alkaline. The Ap horizon, or the upper 7 inches when mixed, has chroma of 2 or 3 and value of 5 through 7 dry and 3 through 5 moist. The organic matter of the upper 15 inches averages more than 0.9 percent. The B horizon is silt loam, or loam. It has weak prismatic to weak or moderate subangular blocky structure. Clay films range from none to few or common and are thin."

Agency soils lack calcic horizons.  Ferdelford soils have weathered tuff at depths of less than 20 inches.  Legler soils have sola thicker than 40 inches. McCain soils have argillic horizons. North Powder soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Pocan soils are 40 to 60 inches deep over granitic bedrock. Redmond soils have 20 to 60 percent ash in the control section. Vickery soils have a duripan and lack bedrock."

The soils formed in a thin covering of loess over residuum (or possibly colluvium) weathered from basalt. The climate is dry summers.  Frost-free period is 120 to 160 days. Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches, including 0.5 to 2 feet of snow."
