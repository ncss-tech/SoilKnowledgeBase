Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium, colluvium, and loess from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  The climate has dry, hot summers and cool, moist winters.   Average annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches and average annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 145 days."
