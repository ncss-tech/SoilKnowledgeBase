  "OVERVIEW": "The soils of the Pegler series are shallow, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and alluvium from mixed volcanic and sedimentary rocks over residuum from soft tuff. They are on rock pediments. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 cm and the mean annual air temperature is about 7.9 degrees C.",
