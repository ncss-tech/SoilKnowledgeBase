These soils formed in volcanic ash and alluvium from mixed volcanic and sedimentary rocks over residuum from soft tuff. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The climate is cool, semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of about 200 to 250 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.7 to 8.3 degrees C. The frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
