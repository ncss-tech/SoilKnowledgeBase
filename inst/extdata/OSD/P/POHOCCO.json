(Bw and Bk horizons)\nochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 6 inches.  (Ap horizon)\ncambic horizon:  The zone from 6 to 15 inches.  (Bw horizon)\nRedoximorphic concentrations: (Bw, Bk, and C horizons)\n6/00 changed reaction range in A horizon to include slightly acid. Added clay content and calcium carbonate equivalent to Range in Characteristics from Soil Interpretation Record. Added Frost Free Period to Geographic Setting from Soil Interpretation Record.\nADDITIONAL DATA: The Pohocco soils originally classified as fine-silty, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludolls. However, because of severe erosion, these soils no longer have the thick, dark surface layer necessary for this classification.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
