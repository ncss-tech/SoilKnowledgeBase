Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand.  Reaction is medium acid through neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand.  Reaction is medium acid through neutral.  It has none to few mottles and has 1/8 inch thick discontinuous red and brown lamellae in some pedons.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8 and contains none to common yellow, brown, and red mottles. The texture is sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam, or clay loam.  The upper 20 inches contains 18 to 30 percent clay.  Reaction is very strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe Bt2 and BC horizons are in shades of brown, gray, and red or are mottled in these colors.  Streaks and pockets of uncoated sand grains range from none to 10 percent by volume.  The texture is sandy clay loam or fine sandy loam."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Kenney, Landman, Latch, Lutterloh and Tonkaver series in the same family and the Boy, Darco, Desan, Larue, Patilo, and Troup series.  Kenney soils have red Bt horizons and lack gray mottles. Landman soils contain plinthite below 60 inches. Latch soils have mottles with chroma of 2 within 30 inches of the surface.  Lutterloh soils are dominated by chroma of 1 or 2 within 30 inches of the surface. Tonkaver soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of between 60 and 80 inches. Boy soils contain plinthite and have gray B21t horizons. Darco and Troup soils have base saturation of less than 35 percent. Desan and Patilo soils are dry for more than 90 days in most years. Larue soils have sandy A horizons less than 40 inches thick and have red Bt horizons."

The soil formed in lentil sands mainly of the Queen City and Wilcox Geologic Group. Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  At the type location, mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches; average annual temperature ranges from 62 to 68 degrees F., and P-E index ranges from 64 to 76.  Frost free days range from 235 to 275."

Larue soils are on similar positions.  Duffern and Tonkawa soils lack argillic horizons."
