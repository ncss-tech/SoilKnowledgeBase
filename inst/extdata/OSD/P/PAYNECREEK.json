  "OVERVIEW": "The Paynecreek series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in mixed alluvium from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  Paynecreek soils are on stream terraces with slopes of 0 to 16 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 360 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.",
