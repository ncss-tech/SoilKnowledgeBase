These soils formed in mixed alluvium from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer.  The average annual precipitation is 330 to 410 cm, and the average annual temperature is 5.0 to 7.2 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 60 to 100 days."
