  "REVDATE": "06/2004",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Picacho series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils on strongly dissected plutonic uplands.  They formed in residuum and colluvium that weathered from granodiorite of the Rio Blanco stock.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 185 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F.  Slopes range from 10 to 80 percent.",

Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, and brown range from few to many.  Redox depletions are common to many in the upper Bw horizon and decrease with depth.  Texture is sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam.\nThe C horizon has colors in hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8; or there is no dominant color and is multicolored in shades of red, brown, and yellow.

The poorly drained Guayabota soils are shallow to bedrock.  Icacos soils are on lower adjacent river flood plains.  The well drained Los Guineos soils have more clay in the control section and are Oxisols.  The well drained Utuado soils have coarse-loamy control sections.  The well drained Yunque soils have mixed mineralogy."
