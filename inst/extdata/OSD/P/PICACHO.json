Content of pebbles and cobbles range from 0 to 10 percent, by volume in the A and Bw horizons and from 0 to 15 percent, by volume, in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, and brown range from few to many.  Redox depletions are common to many in the upper Bw horizon and decrease with depth.  Texture is sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam.\nThe C horizon has colors in hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8; or there is no dominant color and is multicolored in shades of red, brown, and yellow.    Texture is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or their gravelly or cobbly analogs."

The poorly drained Guayabota soils are shallow to bedrock.  Icacos soils are on lower adjacent river flood plains.  The well drained Los Guineos soils have more clay in the control section and are Oxisols.  The well drained Utuado soils have coarse-loamy control sections.  The well drained Yunque soils have mixed mineralogy."
