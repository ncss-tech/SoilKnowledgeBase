  "REVDATE": "05/1999",
  "STATES": "MT,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinelli series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in thick, calcareous, alluvium and slope alluvium derived principally from sedimentary bedrock.  These soils are on alluvial fans and valley sideslopes with slopes ranging from 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches.",
