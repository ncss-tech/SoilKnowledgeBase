    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is greater than 5 feet.  Pebbles and cobblestones dominantly of sandstone range from 0 to 50 percent in the A horizon, and the weighted average by volume in the C horizon is dominantly greater than 50 percent, but ranges from 35 to 70 percent.  Subhorizons of the C horizon in some pedons are nearly free of rock fragments and in others it ranges to 80 percent.  Unlimed soils are mildly alkaline to very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 2 through 4.  Dry value is 6 or greater.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, loamy sandor loamy fine sand.  It shows evidence of stratification in the lower part in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loamy sand or sand.  Subhorizons of sandy loam, gravelly or cobbly sandy loam are in some pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Huel and Juno series in the same family, and the Pope and Tioga series in related families.  Huel and Juno soils are in a wet, cool marine climate having cool, relatively dry summers and moist, wet winters.  Huel soils have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y and an annual precipitation range of 120 to 160 inches.  Juno soils contain glacial erratics and have an annual precipitation range of 70 to 100 inches.  Pope and Tioga soils have a cambic horizon and a coarse-loamy particle-size control section."

Potomac soils formed in mixed alluvium washed from upland soils derived from sandstone, siltstone, shale and some limestone.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 44 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 55 degrees F."

The associated soils on flood plains have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section.  Chagrin and Lobdell soils are fine-loamy in the particle-size control section.  Huntington, Lindside and Melvin soils are fine-silty in the silty particle-size control sections.  The Berks, Dekalb, Elliber, Hazelton and Weikert soils are loamy-skeletal in the particle-size control ssection.  Elliber soils also have an argillic horizon."
