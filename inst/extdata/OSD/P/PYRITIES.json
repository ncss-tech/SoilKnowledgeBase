  "STATES": "CT,NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pyrities series consists of very deep, well drained soils on uplands. They formed in loamy, calcareous till. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum and moderately low to high in the substratum. Mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches.",

It is commonly fine sandy loam and less commonly is silt loam or loam. Structure is weak or moderate, granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through neutral.  A horizons are up to 5 inches  thick.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma 1 through 3. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam. Structure is weak or moderate, granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable.

The Kalurah soils are on lower topographic positions than Pyrities soils and have low chroma mottles above 24 inches. Malone, Muskellunge, and Swanton soils have aquic moisture regimes and are on lower backslopes, footslopes, and toe slopes. Nehasne soils are on nearby bedrock controlled terraces where the till regolith is 20 to 40 inches deep over bedrock. Waddington soils are on similar topographic positions as the Pyrities soils, but have sandy-skeletal family textures."
