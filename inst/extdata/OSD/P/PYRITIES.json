  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 25 to 50 inches. Bedrock is deeper than 60 inches. The depth of free carbonates ranges from 40 to 80 inches. Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent by volume in the A and B horizons and from 5 to 50 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is commonly fine sandy loam and less commonly is silt loam or loam. Structure is weak or moderate, granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through neutral.  A horizons are up to 5 inches  thick.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma 1 through 3. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam. Structure is weak or moderate, granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. It is commonly fine sandy loam and less commonly sandy loam or loam. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam. Structure is weak or moderate, platy or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable. Reaction ranges from slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam. Some pedons have thin layers of loamy sand. Structure is massive, or massive with plate-like divisions. Consistence is friable or firm.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pyrities soils are on the convex tops of ridges and hills in glaciated uplands. Slopes are commonly 3 to 15 percent, but the complete range is 0 to 45 percent. The soils formed in loamy till dominated by dolomitic limestone, sandstone, calcareous shale, and limestone materials. The mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 50 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kalurah, Malone, Muskellunge, Nehasne, Swanton, and Waddington soils. The Kalurah soils are on lower topographic positions than Pyrities soils and have low chroma mottles above 24 inches. Malone, Muskellunge, and Swanton soils have aquic moisture regimes and are on lower backslopes, footslopes, and toe slopes. Nehasne soils are on nearby bedrock controlled terraces where the till regolith is 20 to 40 inches deep over bedrock. Waddington soils are on similar topographic positions as the Pyrities soils, but have sandy-skeletal family textures."
