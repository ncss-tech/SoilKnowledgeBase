These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The mollic epipedon is 25 to 35 inches thick and includes the upper part of the argillic horizon. The upper 13 to 19 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 grams per cubic centimeter, volcanic glass content of 7 to 25 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 0.7 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples. The particle-size control section has 27 to 35 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. It has 0 to 5 percent rock fragments by volume. Organic matter is estimated to range from 3 to 5 percent in the Ap or A horizons decreasing to less than 1 percent below 35 inches.\nThe Ap horizons have value of 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2, dry or moist. Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2, dry or moist. Reaction is neutral or slightly acid. Texture is ashy loam or ashy silt loam.\nThe BAt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3, dry or moist. Texture is clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 4, dry or moist. Texture is clay loam or silty clay loam.
