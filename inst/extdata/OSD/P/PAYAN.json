  "OVERVIEW": "The Payan series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium or colluvium weathered from multi-colored, non-calcareous shale and sandstone.  Payan soils are on hillslopes, ridges, and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 8.9 degrees C.",
