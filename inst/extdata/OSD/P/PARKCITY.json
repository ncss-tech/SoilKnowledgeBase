  "OVERVIEW": "The Parkcity series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium and residuum derived from limestone, quartzite, and sandstone.  Parkcity soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
