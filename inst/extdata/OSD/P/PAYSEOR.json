  "REVDATE": "07/2007",
  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Payseor series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in clayey till overlying loamy till on till plains. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very slow in the clayey material and moderate or moderately slow in the loamy material.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
