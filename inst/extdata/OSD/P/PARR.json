  "OVERVIEW": "The Parr series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are moderately deep to dense till. The Parr soils formed in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of silty material and in the underlying loam till. A cap of fine sandy loam sediments is at the surface in some areas. They are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
