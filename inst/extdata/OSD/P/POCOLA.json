It is loam, silt\nloam, clay loam, or silty clay loam and ranges from strongly acid\nto slightly acid.\nThe B21t horizon is dark gray (10YR 4/1), gray (10YR 5/1), very\ndark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), or dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2)\nand has gray and brown mottles.  It is silty clay loam or clay\nloam and clay content ranges from 27 to 35 percent.  The B21t\nhorizon ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.  Some pedons\nlack the silty clay loam or clay loam B21t horizons.\nThe B22t and B23t horizons are very dark gray (10YR 3/1), dark\ngray (10YR 4/1), gray (10YR 5/1, 6/1), light gray (10YR 7/1), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), or dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2)\nand have gray, red, or brown mottles.  They are clay or silty clay and the clay content ranges from 40 to 60 percent.  They range\nfrom strongly acid to moderately alkaline but noncalcareous.\nThe B3 horizon is reddish brown (5YR 4/3, 4/4) or dark brown\n(7.5YR 4/4; 10YR 4/3, 3/3).  It is clay or silty clay.  It is moderately alkaline and usually calcareous with calcium carbonate concretions.\nThe C horizon is dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2), dark reddish brown\n(5YR 3/4), reddish brown (5YR 4/4), or dark brown (7.5YR 4/4).  It\nis clay or silty clay and is moderately alkaline and usually calcareous with calcium carbonate concretions."

Baldwin, Dowellton, Jackport, Mayhew, Midland, Panola, Sessum, Tensas, and Wilson soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy.  In addition, Dowellton and Jackport soils have more than 60 percent clay in the control section.  Boswell, Gore, McKamie, and White Store soils are more red in at least the upper part of the B2t horizon.  In addition McKamie\nsoils decrease in clay content at depths of 24 to 60 inches and\nWhite Store soils have sandstone bedrock at depths of 24 to 40 inches."

Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent.\nThey have formed in calcareous clayey alluvium.  They are rare or occasionally flooded.  The climate is humid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 55 inches.  Mean annual\ntemperature ranges from 60 degrees to 64 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 64 to 80."
