  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinerun series consists of very deep, well drained soils on flood plains.  They formed in alluvium containing a high content of chert fragments.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",

Britwater soils have a fine-loamy particle size class and Waben soils have a lower base saturation.  Goss, Moko, Scholten, Ocie, and Rueter soils are on uplands.  Goss soils have a clayey-skeletal particle size class.  Moko soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock.  Scholten soils have a fragipan.  Ocie soils have a strongly contrasting particle size class, and Rueter soils are somewhat excessively drained.  Secesh soils are on larger floodplains and have a fine-loamy particle size class."
