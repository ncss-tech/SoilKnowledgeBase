  "OVERVIEW": "The Pold series consists of very deep soils that are moderately deep to a fragipan. They are moderately well drained and found on hill slopes and interfluves. The soils formed in loess and Tertiary age alluvium with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low in the fragipan, moderately low in the glossic horizon and moderately high and high in the overlying material. Slope ranges from 5 to 30 percent. The average annual temperature is about 6.5 degrees C. and the average annual precipitation is about 889 mm.",
