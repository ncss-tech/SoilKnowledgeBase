  "OVERVIEW": "The Palinor series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from limestone and dolomite.  Palinor soils are on fan remnants and ballenas.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
