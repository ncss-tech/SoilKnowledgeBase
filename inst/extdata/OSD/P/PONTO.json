  "OVERVIEW": "The Ponto series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash deposited over semiconsolidated glacial outwash.  Ponto soils are on toe slopes and alluvial terraces.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
