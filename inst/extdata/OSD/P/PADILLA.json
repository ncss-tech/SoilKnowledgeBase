  "OVERVIEW": "The Padilla series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from sedimentary rock.  Padilla soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

Chafin, Mags and Silver soils have hue yellower than 5YR. In addition, Chafin soils do not have visible accumulations of secondary carbonates. Silver series attempts to reflect the effects of soil forming agents unique to the Great Plains. Hawaikah soils have an argillic horizon that does not extend below 40 inches.  Servilleta and Tobish soils have bedrock at moderate depths.  Lonti soils do not have secondary carbonates in the argillic horizon."
