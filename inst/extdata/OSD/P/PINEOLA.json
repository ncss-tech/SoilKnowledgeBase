  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Soils now included with the Pineola series were previously mapped with Harmiller soils. Harmiller soils do not have the a humic extragrade feature and have siliceous mineralogy.\nThe 1/98 revision places the Pineola series in a fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Humic Hapludults family.  CEC activity class placement is based on family placement of similar soils such as Trimont.  Additionally, depth to hard bedrock was changed from greater than 60 inches to greater than 40 inches.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon (humic feature) - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 7 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 7 to 26 inches (Bt and BC horizons)\nParalithic contact - weathered bedrock contact at 32 inches (upper boundary of the Cr horizon)\nMLRA: 130 \t\t\t\tSIR(s): NC0300"

  "ADDITIONAL DATA": {
    "section": "ADDITIONAL DATA",
    "content": "ADDITIONAL DATA: Mineralogy data is available from the Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln NE; pedon number S95-NC-011-002.  However, initial analysis indicated paramicaceous mineralogy, but subsequent grain counts on the same samples, performed at the West Virginia University characterization lab by MO-13 personnel, indicate mixed mineralogy with only about 3 or 5 percent mica by grain count."
