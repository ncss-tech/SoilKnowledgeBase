  "OVERVIEW": "The Pineywoods series consists of deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils on uplands in the Northern Piedmont Province.  They formed in residuum of anorthosite.  Slopes range from 0 to 7 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

Angular rock fragments (2 to 10 mm) of blue quartz and anorthosite range from 0 to 35 percent throughout the soil.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through slightly acid in the A and Eg horizons, from very strongly acid through strongly acid in the Btg horizon, and from strongly acid through slightly acid in the Cg horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y or is neutral, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is clay, silty clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Cg horizon is saprolite with hue of 10YR through 5Y or is neutral, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 7 or 8, and chroma of 1.  It is soft anorthosite bedrock that crushes to sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam."
