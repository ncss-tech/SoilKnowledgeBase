  "OVERVIEW": "The Povirt series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from limestone, quartzite, sandstone, and tuff.  Povirt soils are on relict lakebeds.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

These soils are susceptible to frequent ponding for very long duration from April through June with water up to 1 foot deep.  Episaturation is present with a seasonal perched water table between the soil surface and 1.5 feet (very shallow or shallow free water occurrence classes) between April and June.  Cumulative annual duration class is Transitory.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding year-round."
