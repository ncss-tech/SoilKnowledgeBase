Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 4,900 to 5,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches, the mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; negligible surface runoff; very slow permeability (low or moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity).  These soils are susceptible to frequent ponding for very long duration from April through June with water up to 1 foot deep.  Episaturation is present with a seasonal perched water table between the soil surface and 1.5 feet (very shallow or shallow free water occurrence classes) between April and June.  Cumulative annual duration class is Transitory.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding year-round."
