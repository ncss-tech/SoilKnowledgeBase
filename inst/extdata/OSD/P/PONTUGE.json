  "OVERVIEW": "The Pontuge series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone and conglomerate material.  Pontuge soils are on terrace sides, hillsides and mountainsides and have slopes of 15 to 35 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
