  "BYREV": "RD: JVC-WRJ-RJA-ACT",
  "REVDATE": "11/2000",
  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ponciano series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from sandstone and mudstones. Ponciano soils are on hillslopes below mesas and structural benches and on cuesta scarp faces. Slope ranges from 15 to 60 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and average annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",

(Bw horizon)\nSalinity values were determined on the type location and one other pedon with a Wheatstone bridge. The remaining pedons are estimated to have similar values. There may be less than 10,000 acres of this series recognized in the Socorro County Area survey, but it is estimated that many more acres of this soil exist in surrounding areas. Landscapes that this soil occurs on in adjacent survey areas were mapped in the past as miscellaneous land types such as rock land, steep rock land and shale rock land.
