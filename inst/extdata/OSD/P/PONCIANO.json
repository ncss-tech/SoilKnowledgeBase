All of these series have active cation exchange activity class.  In addition, Camino soils have a paralithic contact between 40 and 60 inches of the surface.  Gish soils receive winter precipitation, Litle soils have a paralithic contact between 20 and 40 inches of the surface, and Losmarios soils have hue 7.5YR or yellower."

Ponciano soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from sandstones and mudstones. Slope ranges from 15 to 60 percent The average annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F. The average frost-free period ranges from 160 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 5,600 to 6,600 feet."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 3 inches. (A horizon)\nCambic horizon: 3 to 11 inches. (Bw horizon)\nSalinity values were determined on the type location and one other pedon with a Wheatstone bridge. The remaining pedons are estimated to have similar values. There may be less than 10,000 acres of this series recognized in the Socorro County Area survey, but it is estimated that many more acres of this soil exist in surrounding areas. Landscapes that this soil occurs on in adjacent survey areas were mapped in the past as miscellaneous land types such as rock land, steep rock land and shale rock land.
