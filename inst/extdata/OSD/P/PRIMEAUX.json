The soils formed in residuum of derived from chert, quartzite, and shale bedrock with a small component of loess containing volcanic ash.  The climate is cool and semiarid with moist winters and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 400 mm; mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C.; and the frost-free season is about 60 to 80 days."
