The mean annual soil  temperature is 36 to 38 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 60 inches or more.  The particle-size control section averages less than 35 percent total rock fragments and has 10 to 15 percent clay in the upper part and 20 to 30 percent clay in the lower part.  P-retention is more than 85 percent and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid oxalate extractable iron is 3 to 5 percent in the less than 2.0mm fraction.  The 15-bar water is 12 to 15 percent on air-dry samples.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  There is 20 to 40 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregate in the 0.02 to 2.0mm fraction.  It is gravelly sandy loam or very bouldery sandy loam.  It has 15 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 30 percent boulders.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.
