  "OVERVIEW": "The Plomosa series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in slope alluvium, colluviums, and or residuum derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks.  Plomosa soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 3 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F.",
