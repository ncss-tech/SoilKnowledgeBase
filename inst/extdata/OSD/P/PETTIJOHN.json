  "OVERVIEW": "The Pettijohn series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over granitic colluvium.  These soils are on backslopes of mountains.  Slopes are 35 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the volcanic ash mantle is 30 to 45 inches and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.85 to 1.00 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizons have value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 to 6 dry or moist.  It is very cobbly ashy fine sandy loam or very stony ashy fine sandy loam.  It has  35 to 60 percent rock fragments with 10 to 20 percent gravel, 10 to 35 percent cobbles, and 2 to 15 percent stones.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam or very cobbly sandy loam.  It has 35 to 60 percent rock fragments with 20 to 40 percent gravel, 5 to 20 percent cobbles and 2 to 10 percent stones."

The Kusu soils is 40 to 60 inches to lithic contact.  Twelvemile soils have 7 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have a Bt horizon.   Stices soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days after the summer solstice. The Yallani soils average 18 to 24 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Natkim soils are dry 45 to 60 consecutive days.  Roundknoll soils have a calcic horizon at 10 to 20 inches.  Stien soils have an ash mantle 14 to 20 inches thick with the lower material being sandy-skeletal."
