These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the volcanic ash mantle is 30 to 45 inches and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.85 to 1.00 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizons have value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 to 6 dry or moist.  It is very cobbly ashy fine sandy loam or very stony ashy fine sandy loam.  It has  35 to 60 percent rock fragments with 10 to 20 percent gravel, 10 to 35 percent cobbles, and 2 to 15 percent stones.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam or very cobbly sandy loam.  It has 35 to 60 percent rock fragments with 20 to 40 percent gravel, 5 to 20 percent cobbles and 2 to 10 percent stones."

The Doe soils are loamy coarse sand in the 2C horizon and have 20 to 35 inches of volcanic ash influence.  The Grenet soils is 20 to 40 inches to paralithic contact.  The Kusu soils is 40 to 60 inches to lithic contact.  Twelvemile soils have 7 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have a Bt horizon.   Stices soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days after the summer solstice. The Yallani soils average 18 to 24 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Natkim soils are dry 45 to 60 consecutive days.  Roundknoll soils have a calcic horizon at 10 to 20 inches.  Stien soils have an ash mantle 14 to 20 inches thick with the lower material being sandy-skeletal."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Pettijohn soils are on backslopes of mountains at elevation of 2,600 to 5,900 feet.  Slopes are 35 to 65 percent. These soils formed in a mixture of volcanic ash and granitic colluvium.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 30 inches. The mean January temperature is 22 to 26 degrees F., the mean July temperature is 62 to 67  degrees F., and the mean annual air temperature is 40 to 46 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
