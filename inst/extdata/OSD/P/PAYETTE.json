    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Payette soils are in strongly dissected, uplands and terraces in the Idaho and related formations at elevations of 2,300 to 4,000 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 75 percent. The soils formed in coarse or moderately coarse textured, old, unconsolidated or poorly consolidated sediments. The sediments are high in quartz, micaceous, and feldspathic material, and are derived mostly from intrusive acid igneous rocks. The climate has relatively dry summers. Frost-free period of 140 to 160 days, and average annual precipitation of 10 to 13 inches, including 1.5 to 4 feet of snowfall.  Average annual air temperature is 46 to 51 degrees F."

Cashmere, Harpt, and Lolalita soils lack an argillic horizon, and the Lolalita soils lack a mollic epipedon. Van Dusen soils have a mollic epipedon thicker than 20 inches and a fine-loamy argillic horizon."
