  "OVERVIEW": "The Payette series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived mainly from intrusive acid igneous rocks. Payette soils are on strongly dissected uplands and have slopes of 0 to 75 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and average annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.",

Slopes range from 0 to 75 percent. The soils formed in coarse or moderately coarse textured, old, unconsolidated or poorly consolidated sediments. The sediments are high in quartz, micaceous, and feldspathic material, and are derived mostly from intrusive acid igneous rocks. The climate has relatively dry summers. Frost-free period of 140 to 160 days, and average annual precipitation of 10 to 13 inches, including 1.5 to 4 feet of snowfall.  Average annual air temperature is 46 to 51 degrees F."

Van Dusen soils have a mollic epipedon thicker than 20 inches and a fine-loamy argillic horizon."
