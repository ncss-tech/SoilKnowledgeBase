The excessively drained Alpin soils are on higher positions, are sandy throughout, and have lamellae.  The somewhat excessively drained to moderately well drained Blanton soils are on similar to higher positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches in thickness.  The well drained Bonneau soils are on slightly higher positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness.  Chiefland soils are on similar positions, are moderately deep to limestone bedrock, and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness.  The somewhat poorly drained Falmouth soils are on similar positions and have smectitic mineralogy.  The somewhat poorly drained Lynchburg soils are on lower positions and have fine-loamy subsoils.  Otela soils are on similar positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness.  The somewhat excessively drained Troup soils are on higher positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches in thickness."
