  "OVERVIEW": "The Pyeatt series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fan alluvium from mixed calcareous sources.  Pyeatt soils are on fan terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
