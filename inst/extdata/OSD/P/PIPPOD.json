The solum ranges in thickness from 3 to 9 inches and depth to sand and gravel ranges from 1 to 8 inches.  The particle-size size control section is sandy-skeletal and averages 35 to 70 percent coarse fragments.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum and slightly acid or neutral in the substratum.\nThe A/E or E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value moist of 2, 3, or 4; chroma moist of 1, 2, or 3.  Texture is silt loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value moist of 3 or 4; chroma moist of 3 through 6.  Texture is silt loam or fine sandy loam.  Rock fragments include 0 to 25 percent rounded gravel and cobble.\nThe BC and 2BC horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value moist of 3 or 4; chroma moist of 4 through 6.  Texture is coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, loamy sand, or fine sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 70 percent and include 30 to 70 percent rounded gravel and 0 to 25 percent rounded cobble.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value moist of 3 or 4; chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or loamy sand.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 70 percent and include 30 to 70 percent rounded gravel and 0 to 25 percent rounded cobble."

Altapeak soils have hard cinders in the control section and a paralithic contact at 40 to 60\ninches.  Kichatna soils have a volcanic ash influenced loess mantle. Line soils are 15 to 35 percent cinders in the upper part of the particle-size control section.  Lutak soils have massive, firm substrata. Nikishka soils have gravelly silt loam textures in the upper part of the control section.  Skipeak soils have solums 15 to 30 inches thick."
