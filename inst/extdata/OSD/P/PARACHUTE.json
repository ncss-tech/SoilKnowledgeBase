Depth to the lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The control section is typically loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 85 percent by volume, most of which are 3/4 to 3 inches in length.\nThe A and Bw horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction in the A and B horizons is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe BC horizon and C horizon, if present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline."

Krackle soils have an aridic moisture regime and are typically cobbly or stony. Middlehill and Rockabin soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control sections.  Decram soils are dry more than 30 days in summer and fall. Conical, Foxmount and Grafen soils have a paralithic contact above 40 inches.  Supervisor soils formed in material weathered from Granite and lack a cambic horizon.  Brickel soils have a xeric moisture regime and formed in material weathered from gneiss."
