  "OVERVIEW": "The Pamsdel series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone with a minor component of shale. Pamsdel soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
