Ashdale soils have limestone bedrock at 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches). Broadwell soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess over eolian sand. Dinsdale soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess and underlying glacial till. Douglas and Ogle soils have redder hues in the lower part and have horizons developed in Illinoisan Sangamon Paleosol till. Elkhart soils have carbonates within 102 cm (40 inches). Elmont soils have a paralithic contact within 152 cm (60 inches). Healing soils formed in alluvium from limestone and have chert and sandstone fragments in the series control section. Lycurgus soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loamy sediments with 10 to 40 percent sand over loess. Malcolm soils have 12 to 18 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Meadowbank soils have less than 15 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Mendota soils formed in 51 to 86 cm (20 to 34 inches) of loess and the underlying calcareous gravelly loam or gravelly sandy loam glacial till. Mickle, and Wiota soils formed in silty slope alluvium and do not have a lithologic discontinuity. Osco, Sibley, Tama, and Wakenda soils formed entirely in loess and do not have a lithologic discontinuity. Plano soils have 5 to 20 percent clay and average 25 to 80 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Proctor soils have less than 20 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Richwood soils have more than 40 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Ripon soils have limestone bedrock within 102 cm (40 inches). Sidell soils formed in 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches) of silty material and underlying loamy glaciofluvial material and glacial till. Tecumseh soils formed in 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches) of loess over glacial till. Toddville soils have more than 40 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Waupecan soils average more than 15 percent gravel in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Parkway soils are on relatively undissected loess covered till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent and are typically convex. Parkway soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess or other silty material and underlying calcareous loamy till. The mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 12.8 degrees C (46 to 55 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 760 to 1020 mm (30 to 40 inches), frost-free period ranges form 150 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 207 to 305 meters (680 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."
