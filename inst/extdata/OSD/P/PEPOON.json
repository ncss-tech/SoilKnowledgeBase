  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature at the lithic contact ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F. The control section contains more 30 percent volcanic glass in the fraction less than 2 mm in size and contains 35 to 50 percent coarse fragments by weighted average, dominantly stone size. These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches or the lithic contact for more than 45 to 60 consecutive days. Depth to bedrock and thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 15 inches. The soil reaction ranges from from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, range in values of 1 to 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist. They are stony or very stony, ashy loam or ashy silt loam and are massive, single grain, or have weakly blocky structure.\nThe 2R horizon is fractured quartzitic bedrock."

The regolith consists of volcanic ash with granitic coarse fragments and a mixture of glacial till. Pepoon soils occur in a cold subhumid climate; the mean annual precipitation is 18 to 35 inches; the mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.; and the frost free period is 90 to 110 days."
