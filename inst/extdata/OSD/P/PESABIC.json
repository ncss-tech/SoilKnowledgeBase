Stands are mostly red maple and sugar maple, but northern red oak, yellow birch, paper birch, and eastern hemlock are also common. On foot slopes, where the perched seasonal high water table persists the longest, red maple, balsam fir, and quaking aspen dominate stands. Some areas are used for cropland. Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay."
