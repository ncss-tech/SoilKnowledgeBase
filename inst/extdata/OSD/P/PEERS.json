In undisturbed areas an apparent water table has an upper limit of 51 to 75 centimeters (20 to 29 inches) during November to May in most years. These soils are subject to occasional flooding due to levee breaks."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were previous mapped Blake soils in Missouri. They differ from Blake soils by having a mollic epipedon and a cambic horizon.  They also lack carbonates throughout the control section for the calcareous class. The name is from a small town in the survey area.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 56 centimeters (22 inches) (Ap1 Ap2, and A horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from approximately 56 to 150 centimeters (22 inches to 50 inches) (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data; University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri; Pedon ID M0718313 is data for the OSD typical pedon; Pedon IDs M0613904, M0621903, M0621905, M0713905, M0715103, M0718904, M0721907, and M0721909 are additional data used for the series range in characteristics.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
