  "OVERVIEW": "The Parmod series consists of very deep, well drained soils on till plains and moraines. They formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy till. Slope ranges from 2 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
