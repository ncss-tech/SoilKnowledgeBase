  "OVERVIEW": "The Poorhouse series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in residuum weathered from limestone with some colluvial influence from adjacent landscapes. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. They are found on nearly level to gently sloping, slightly concave uplands. Mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
