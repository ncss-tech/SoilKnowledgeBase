Texture of the fine earth is silt loam , loam, or silty clay loam. Also included is loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6 with few through many high and low chroma redoximorphic features. Some pedons have gleyed horizons with chroma of 2 or less below a depth of 16 inches.

The Banister, Branchville, Cardinal, Celine, Eudy, Hartville, Jerktail, Loudon, Tarton, and Whippany soils in a related family. Banister soils include moderately well drained soils and are formed in clayey alluvium. Branchville, Cardinal, Celina, Loudon, and Tarton soils are moderately well drained. Eudy soils have formed in loess and have moderately slow permeability. Hartville soils have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR in the upper BT horizon. Jerktail soils have a mean annual temperature of 56 degrees F. Whippany soils have stratification in the C horizon and textures that range to loamy sand."
