  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Punchbowl series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum derived from andesite, dacite, rhyolite, tuffs and minor areas of shale.  Punchbowl soils are on crests and side slopes of hills and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
