    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Punchbowl soils are on convex rounded hill sides and crests and on lower side slopes of mountains.  They formed in residuum derived from andesite, dacite, rhyolite, welded tuffs and minor areas of shale.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1,830 to 2,380 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to l00 days."

Rock fragments in the argillic horizon were increased to 25 to 35 percent.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the surface to 15 cm (A1 and A2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 15 to 25 cm (Bt horizon).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 25 cm (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from the soil surface to 25 cm (A1, A2, and Bt horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL #S8lNV-0l5-300.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
