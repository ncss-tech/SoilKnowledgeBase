Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,345 meters.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between the soil surface and 46 cm (very shallow and shallow free water occurrence classes) from January to June.  Water levels may drop as low as 76 cm between July and September.  Cumulative annual duration class is Permanent.  These soils are susceptible to frequent ponding for long duration from January through June with water up to 15 cm deep."
