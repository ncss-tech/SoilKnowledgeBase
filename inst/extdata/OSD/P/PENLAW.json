  "OVERVIEW": "The Penlaw series consists of deep and very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in colluvium derived primarily from limestone but with some shale and sandstone.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low to moderately high.  Mean annual precipitation is 43 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 54 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to fragipan ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 72 inches or more.  Rock fragments of chert, weathered limestone, shale or rarely, sandstone range from 0 to 10 percent above the fragipan, from 0 to 30 percent in the fragipan and C horizon.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral throughout the soil.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Some pedons have a BA horizon.  Texture is silt loam in the fine- earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 through 8.  Mottles with chroma of 2 or less are at depths of 8 to 18 inches.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Structure ranges from moderate to strong, fine to medium subangular blocky, blocky or prismatic.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8 and normally has many grayish and brown mottles.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction and has medium or coarse angular or subangular blocky arranged in very coarse prisms to medium or thick platy structure.  Fragipan expression is weak or moderate.  Some pedons have friable to firm silt loam to silty clay BC horizons below the fragipan.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 2 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 8.  Texture ranges from loam to clay in the fine-earth fraction.  Some pedons have 2C horizons containing high amounts of shale."

The soils formed in a silty mantle of loess or alluvium, colluvium, and the underlying residuum of limestone on nearly level stream terraces, alluvial fans, and on nearly level concave uplands\nThe Chalfont, Haubstadt, Pekin, Robbs, Rohrersville, Rossmoyne, Sciotoville, and Shakamak series are in closely related families.  Chalfont soils have a lithologic discontinuity with a distinct increase in rock fragments within the series control section.  Haubstadt and Shakamak soils have sola more than 60 inches thick. Pekin, Rossmoyne, and Sciotoville soils have strongly to very strongly acid Bt horizons.  Robbs soils are formed from loess.  Rohrersville soils have hues of 2.5Y or 5Y in the B horizon."

Penlaw soils formed in colluvium derived largely from limestones but with some admixture of shale and sandstone.  The climate is temperate and humid. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 50 inches, the mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 58 degrees F., and the frost-free season ranges from 140 to 200 days."

Clarksburg soils lack low chroma redoximorphic feature within 18 inches of the surface. Thorndale are very deep, poorly drained soils formed in medium textured colluvium derived from limestone, calcareous shale, and siltstone. Soils of all the other series listed lack fragipans."
