  "OVERVIEW": "The Pherson series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Pherson soils are on alluvial fans, flood-plain steps and in drainage ways.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Rock fragment coats and pendants.  Not recognized as a calcic horizon because no decrease in carbonates was observed in lower horizons.
