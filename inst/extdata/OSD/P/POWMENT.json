The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered granitic rock such as granodiorite.\nReaction: Slightly acid or neutral.\nParticle-size control section - Rock fragments:  Averages 50 to 80 percent, mainly fine gravel.\nC horizons\nTexture:  Very gravelly sand or extremely gravelly sand.\nRock fragments:  50 to 80 percent gravel.\nClay content:  0 to 10 percent.\nOther features:  The C2 horizon takes on grus-like characteristics in some pedons with pararock fragments present."

Elevations range from 1,950 to 2,380 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."
