  "OVERVIEW": "The Powment series consist of very shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rock.  Powment soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 50 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered granitic rock such as granodiorite.\nReaction: Slightly acid or neutral.\nParticle-size control section - Rock fragments:  Averages 50 to 80 percent, mainly fine gravel.\nC horizons\nTexture:  Very gravelly sand or extremely gravelly sand.\nRock fragments:  50 to 80 percent gravel.\nClay content:  0 to 10 percent.\nOther features:  The C2 horizon takes on grus-like characteristics in some pedons with pararock fragments present."
