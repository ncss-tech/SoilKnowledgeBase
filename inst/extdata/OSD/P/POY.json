  "OVERVIEW": "The Poy series consists of very deep poorly drained soils that are moderately deep to sandy deposits.  They formed primarily in clayey water-laid deposits overlying sandy deposits on glacial lake basins and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 711 mm (28 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 7.8 degrees C (46 degrees F).",
