These soils formed in water-laid, primarily clayey deposits overlying sandy deposits.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 635 to 813 mm (25 to 32 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 6.7 to 8.9 degrees C (44 to 48 degrees F)."

The well drained and moderately well drained Borth soils and the somewhat poorly drained Zittau soils are in a drainage sequence with the Poy soils.  The Poygan soils are on similar topographic positions in the upland, but they do not have layers of sand at depths of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches)."

Permeability is slow in the clayey deposit and rapid in the sandy deposit. In certain settings, these soils are subject to common and long duration flooding. These soil have an apparent seasonal high water table at or near the surface for long periods in most years."
