  "OVERVIEW": "The Ponzer series consists of very poorly drained, organic soils in flats and depressions in the lower Coastal Plain. They formed in highly decomposed organic material underlain by loamy textured marine and fluvial sediment. The organic material was derived from herbaceous plants. Slope range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 53 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the organic materials commonly is 16 to 30 inches but ranges to 51 inches. The organic materials are ultra acid to extremely acid except where surface layers have been limed. The underlying mineral horizons are extremely acid through mildly alkaline. Logs, stumps, and fragments of wood occupy 0 to 20 percent of the organic layers. Particles of charcoal and pockets of ash are in some pedons. Flakes of mica are few to common in the mineral horizons of some pedons.\nThe Oa1 or Oap horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 2.5 or 3. The lower tiers have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 2.5 to 4. Fiber content of the organic tiers is 2 to 30 percent unrubbed and less than 10 percent after rubbing. The organic layers are typically massive under natural wet conditions. Upon drainage and cultivation a granular or blocky structure develops in all or part of the organic layers depending upon the nature and depth of the organic material as well as duration of drainage. Some pedons have thin mucky loam A horizons that are less than 15 inches thick underlying the Oa horizons. Color is similar to the Oa horizons.\nThe Ag horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5G, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 1 or 2 or it is neutral with value of 4 to 7. Texture is variable but it is loamy in the control section and may contain a mucky texture modifier."

Belhaven and Scuppernong soils have a slick feel and paste-like organic layers in hues of 5YR and 2.5YR and in addition Scuppernong soils have mineral layers in the control section that are silty. Croatan soils have siliceous underlying mineral material."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ponzer soils are on nearly level to level areas of the Lower Coastal Plain. The soils formed in under very poorly drained conditions from the remains of herbaceous and related woody hydrophytic plants. Elevation near the type location is 15 feet above mean sea level. The mean annual temperature ranges from 51 to 72 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 46 to 58 inches. The growing season is about 190 days."

Arapahoe, Cape Fear, Deloss, Fortescue, Hydeland, Portsmouth, and Weeksville soils are mineral soils with umbric epipedons. Conaby, Pettigrew, Roper, and Wasda soils are mineral soils with histic epipedons. Dare and Pungo soils have more than 51 inches of organic materials over mineral horizons. Pamlico soils have sandy mineral horizons within the control section. Smithton soils are mineral soils and lack a histic epipedon."

In drained areas it is moderate in plowed layers; the underlying mineral layers are moderately slow. Except in drained and developed areas, Ponzer soils are saturated near the surface for 8 to 12 months each year and ponded from November to May in most years."

Another common plant community consists of sweetgum, red maple, redbay, and sweetbay with a few baldcypress, and water tupelo and understory of southern bayberry and greenbrier. Another common plant community consists of red maple, redbay, and sweetbay with a few baldcypress, and water tupelo and understory of southern bayberry and greenbrier. Cultivated areas are pastured or cropped to corn, soybeans, small grain, and some vegetables."
