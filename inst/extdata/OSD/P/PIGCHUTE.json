  "OVERVIEW": "The Pigchute series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium, residuum, and till derived from granitic and metasedimentary rocks. The Pigchute soils are on mountain slopes, glacial-valley walls, and lateral moraines of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 865 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
