  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pridham series consists of somewhat poorly drained slowly permeable soils formed in old alluvium from mixed sources, including rhyolite, andesite, quartzite, granite and limestone on low fans and valley plains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.",

Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent but the micro-relief may be uneven.  These soils formed in old alluvium from mixed sources, including rhyolite, andesite, quartzite, granite and limestone.  The climate is warm semiarid continental.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 58 degrees to 63 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from 155 to 220 days.  The annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 14 inches and occurs as thundershowers from July through September and as gentle fall and winter rains.  The months of May and June are usually dry."

Comoro and Grabe soils are moderately coarse-textured in the control section and lack an argillic horizon.  Forrest and Tubac soils are both well drained, have hue of 7.5YR or redder, and lack an accumulation of salts more soluble than calcium sulfate.  Pima soils are moderately fine-textured and lack an argillic horizon."
