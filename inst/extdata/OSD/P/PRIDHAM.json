    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pridham soils are on level to nearly level low fans and valley plains at elevations of 4,000 to 5,000 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent but the micro-relief may be uneven.  These soils formed in old alluvium from mixed sources, including rhyolite, andesite, quartzite, granite and limestone.  The climate is warm semiarid continental.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 58 degrees to 63 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from 155 to 220 days.  The annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 14 inches and occurs as thundershowers from July through September and as gentle fall and winter rains.  The months of May and June are usually dry."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Cogswell and Guest soils and the Comoro, Forrest, Grabe, Pima and Tubac soils.  Comoro and Grabe soils are moderately coarse-textured in the control section and lack an argillic horizon.  Forrest and Tubac soils are both well drained, have hue of 7.5YR or redder, and lack an accumulation of salts more soluble than calcium sulfate.  Pima soils are moderately fine-textured and lack an argillic horizon."
