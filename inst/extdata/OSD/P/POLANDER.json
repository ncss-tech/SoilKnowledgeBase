Most of the changes were in formatting. Also added ashy modifiers and volcanic ash parent materials, added ashy loamy sand textures to the RIC, expanded ranges of elevation, precipitation, and temperature, updated competing series section, and expanded depth class to include very deep soils (see trip report from May 2015 field review from OR683 Soil Survey Area Project)"
