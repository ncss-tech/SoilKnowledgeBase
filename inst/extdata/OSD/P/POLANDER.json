The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The bulk density is 0.85 to 0.95 grams per cubic centimeter.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 0 to 15 percent rock fragments.  It has 10 to 18 percent clay.  The very fine sand fraction has 50 to 70 percent glass.  It is moderately to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 when moist and 4 or 5 when dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 when moist and 3 or 4 when dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 when moist and 5 or 6 when dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 when moist and dry.  It is loam or sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent of which 0 to 5 percent are cobbles and 0 to 15 percent are gravel.\nThe C horizon has color similar to the Bw horizon.  It is loam or sandy loam and has 10 to 30 percent cobbles and 5 to 20 percent gravel."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum primarily from pyroclastic rocks.  The climate is cool and moist in winters and warm and dry in summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 28 to 32 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees.  The frost-free period is 30 to 50 days."
