    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is more than 60 inches thick.  The part of the argillic horizon within 6 to 16 inches of the upper boundary has a subhorizon with more than 15 percent sodium saturation.  The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout, except the surface layer in areas that have been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, silt, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, silt loam, silt, or very fine sandy loam.  The combined thickness of the A and E horizons commonly ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe B part of the B/E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It has weak to moderate coarse prismatic structure that parts to moderate fine to medium angular and subangular blocky.  The E part has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1.  It is tongues of gray silt loam or silt.  Lenses of silty clay loam are in the lower part of most pedons."

Closely related series include the Alikchi, Basile, Bonn, Caddo, Calhoun, Fountain, Frost, Guyton, McCroy, Rosella, and Verdun soils.  Deerford, Foley, and Hillemann soils have A and E horizons that have a combined thickness of less than 20 inches; also, Deerford and Foley soils are neutral to alkaline in the lower part of the B horizon.  Alikchi, Basile, Caddo, Calhoun, Fountain, Frost, and Guyton soils do not have a natric horizon.  Bonn and Verdun soils have more than 15 percent sodium saturation throughout the argillic horizon.  McCroy and Rosella soils are fine-loamy in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Peoria soils are on flood plains or low stream terraces along streams that drain areas of the Southern Coastal Plain Southern Mississippi Valley Silty Uplands Major Land Resource Areas.  These soils are subject to flooding for very brief duration.  They formed in alluvium in the loess belt that is high in silt.  Near the type location, the mean annual air temperature is about 66 degrees Fahrenheit, and mean annual precipitation is about 57 inches."

The well drained Ariel soils, which are browner and do not have a Bt horizon, are in slightly higher positions near channels.  The poorly drained Bibb soils, which do not have a Bt horizon, are coarse-loamy in the particle-size control section.  Somewhat poorly drained Falaya and Gillsburg soils, which do not have a Bt horizon, are in similar to slightly higher areas of the flood plains.  The poorly drained Henry soils, which have a fragipan, are in similar positions as the Peoria soils."
