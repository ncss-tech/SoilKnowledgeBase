  "OVERVIEW": "The Parowan series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  These soils are on alluvial flats and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 11 inches.",

In more than 7 out of 10 years, the moisture control section is continually dry in all parts more than 50 percent of the time when the soil temperature at the 20 inch depth is above 41 degrees F.\nParowan soils have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 40 to 60 inches, and are saturated with water in one or more layers within 60 inches for 1 month or more per year.\nThe particle size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  The soil is strongly effervescent or effervescent below a depth of 20 inches.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges 15 to 40 percent in the particle size control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Electrical conductivity ranges from 0 to 4 millimohos/cm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam.  Few to many, fine or medium distinct mottles are present in one or more of the C horizons.  Electrical conductivity ranges from 0 to 8 millimhos/cm."
