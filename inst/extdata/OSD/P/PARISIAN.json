  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Pitted calcium carbonate concretions and white salt crystals are in the lower parts of the B2t and C horizons of some pedons.  The soil is weakly cyclic.  The mollic epipedon averages 15 inches thick, but it may be as thin as 10 inches over the subsoil crests and as thick as 24 inches in the subsoil lows.  The COLE exceeds 0.09 below 20 inches and the PLE is more than 6 cm in the uppermost meter.\nThe A horizon is very dark grayish brown to brown in hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma or 2 or 3. Chroma of 4 occurs in the lower part in some pedons.  The A horizon is loam or silt loam.  Reaction ranges from medium acid through neutral.\nThe Bt1 horizon is very dark grayish brown to brown in hue of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It contains common to many, fine and medium, red and brown mottles.  Texture is clay loam, clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam, and the upper Bt horizon is less clayey in the subsoil lows.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon is 35 to 50 percent clay.  Some peds are covered with uncoated sand and silt grains.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt2 and Bt3 horizons are dark grayish brown to olive brown in hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 through 4.  They have common to many, fine and medium, brown and red mottles.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt4 and Bt5 horizons are very dark grayish brown to olive brown in hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 4.  They contain few to common, fine and medium, red and brown mottles.  Texture is clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon is mottled in shades of gray, brown or yellow.  It is clay or clay interbedded with shale.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."

Similar soils include the Barbarosa, Bernard, Bonham, Choteau, Crockett, Dennis, Durant, Mabank, Mayes, Normangee, Okemah, Payne,  and Tabler series. The competing soils occur in more northern latitudes and have shorter growing seasons and lower average soil temperatures.  Barbarosa, Durant, and Tabler soils are in the Ustic moisture regime.  Barbarosa soils have Bt horizons in hues redder than 10YR.  Durant soils have soft powdery lime within a depth of 60 inches.  Tabler soils have sola less than 60 inches thick.  Bernard and Mayes soils are dominantly gray.  Bonham soils have no vertic properties.  Choteau, Dennis, and Okemah soils have mixed mineralogy and have no vertic properties.  Crockett, Mabank, Normangee, and Payne soils have no mollic epipedon.  Summit soils have sola less than 50 inches thick."
