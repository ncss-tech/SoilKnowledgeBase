  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to rock is greater than 60 inches.  Some pedons have a few rounded pebbles or angular gravel in the solum and some contain thin gravelly layers in the lower part of the solum.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid except in surface layers that have been limed.  Transition horizons have color and texture similar to adjacent horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is silt loam, or in some severely eroded areas it is silty clay loam.  Some pedons, have a thin A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles range from none to common in shades of brown, yellow, red, and gray.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay."

Closely related series include the Armour, Atwood, Aycock, Bewleyville, Blevins, Crider, Curtistown, Etowah, Harpeth, Minvale and Mountview series.  Armour, Atwood and Harpeth soils have base saturation of more than 35 percent. Aycock and Blevins soils are siliceous and formed in marine sediments.  Bewleyville and Mountview soils are siliceous and have discontinuties of residuum weathered from limestone below the silty mantle.  Crider soils have base saturation of more than 35 percent and are mesic.  Curtistown soils are siliceous and have surface layers with a value less than 4. Etowah and Minvale soils are fine-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pickwick soils are on old, high terraces of major streams and rivers.  The topography is gently sloping to hilly.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  The soil formed in a silty mantle 1 to 3 feet thick over old alluvium or entirely in old alluvium.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is about 55 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 62 degrees."

Paden soils, on adjacent landscapes, have a fragipan.   Waynesboro soils, on adjacent and slightly higher positions, and Wolftever soils, on lower terraces, are clayey."
