These soils are usually moist in the moisture control section but are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The particle-size control section has moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.25 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, including 0 to 5 percent sand-size pumice, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.20 to 0.40 percent, Phosphate retention is 25 to 40, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples, 15 percent or more fine sand or coarser, 35 to 75 percent rock fragments, and an apparent field estimated clay content of 5 to 10 percent. The solum has base saturation (NH4OAc) of 75 to 100 percent.\nThe A horizon has a value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma is 1 or 2 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has a value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist. Chroma is 1 or 2 dry or moist. It contains 50 to 65 percent rock fragments. The fine earth fraction is ashy fine sandy loam or ashy loam. Reaction ranges from neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has a value of 6 to 8 dry and 4 to 6 moist. Chroma is 1 or 2 dry and 2 or 3 moist. It contains 55 to 75 rock fragments. Reaction ranges from neutral to slightly alkaline."

Elevation is 1,000 to 3,000 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches. Average January temperature is about 25 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 68 degrees F.; and average annual temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F. Frost-free season is 110 to 150 days."
