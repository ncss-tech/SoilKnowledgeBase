  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pintailake series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from limestone, shale, and quartzite.  Pintailake soils are on lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
