  "OVERVIEW": "The Prill series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on foothills.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from volcanic tuff or sedimentary rock.  Slopes are 2 to 55 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
