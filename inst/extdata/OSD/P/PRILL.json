The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the 2Bt discontinuity is 5 to 15 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick and includes the upper part of the 2Bt horizon.  Hue is 7.5YR or 10YR.  The particle-size control section averages 50 to 60 percent clay with 15 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is a silty clay loam, clay loam, or loam.  It is 20 to 40 percent clay and contains 15 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry.

The climate is characterized by cool and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 140 days."
