  "OVERVIEW": "The Parkalley series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from rhyolitic tuff with a loess influence.  They are on mountain slopes and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.",
