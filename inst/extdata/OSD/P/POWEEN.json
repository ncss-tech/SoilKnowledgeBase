  "OVERVIEW": "The Poween series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in calcareous alluvium of mixed mineralogy.  These soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 50 inches thick.  The particle-size control section averages 5 to 18 percent clay and is 0 to 15 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the lower part and is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.\nThe AC horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is sandy loam, silt loam or loam and is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 ore 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.  It is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam and may have thin lenses of sandy loam or loamy fine sand.  Some pedons have few fine strong brown mottles below a depth of 40 inches.  Pebble content ranges from 0 to 15 percent."

Coxlake soils have mottles in the control section and are neutral throughout. Deerspring and Endersby soils are dry for more than 90 consecutive days horizon.  Evans soils are slightly acid in the particle-size control section.  Flofeather soils are somewhat excessively drained and are noncalcareous throughout. Leavenworth soils are non-calcareous in the particle-size control section are are neutral to slightly alkaline throughout.  Lapwai soils have 2Bk horizons. Narcisse soils are slightly acid or neutral and are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 80 consecutive days.  Okanogan soils are noncalcareous in the upper 44 inches and are dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days.  Patit Creek soils have an extremely gravelly 2C horizon at a depth of 20 to 40 inches and are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days.  Pleasant View soils are gravelly in the particle-size control section and have a zone of carbonate accumulation that has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 12 to 25 percent.  Plinco and Porter soils are noncalcareous throughout. Redola soils are calcareous throughout. Threecreeks and Tombeall soils have 2C horizons and are noncalcareous throughout."
