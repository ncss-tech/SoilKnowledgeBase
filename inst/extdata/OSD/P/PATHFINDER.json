    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches) (Ap horizon).\nThis soil is mapped Bankard loamy fine sand, alkali, wet variant in the adjoining Scotts Bluff County Soil Survey Report.  The Pathfinder soil has a lower seasonal water table than Bankard, alkali, wet variant.  The water table in the area has been lowered possibly the result of deepening of the channel of nearby Sheep Creek.  Where this soil is irrigated the upper part of the profile is typically more leached of alkali than in the non-irrigated areas.\nModified format by LRM in 7/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
