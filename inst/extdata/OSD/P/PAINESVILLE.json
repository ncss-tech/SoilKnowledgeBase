  "OVERVIEW": "The Painesville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments and in the underlying till on Wisconsinan age lake plains. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the glaciolacustrine material and moderately low or moderately high in the underlying till. Slope ranges from 0 through 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

    "content": "REMARKS: The taxonomic classification changed from Fine-loamy, mixed, nonacid, mesic Aeric Epiaquepts to Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, nonacid, mesic Aeric Epiaquepts. This is due to analysis of all laboratory data on the particle-size control sections of Painesville pedons and to updates contained in the 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Competing series have changed as similar soils were reclassified.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - from the surface to a depth of 9 inches (Ap horizon).\nAquic conditions - from a depth of 9 to 80 inches.\nCambic horizon - from a depth of 9 to 51 inches (Bg, Bw1, Bw2, 2Bw1 and 2Bw2 horizons)."
