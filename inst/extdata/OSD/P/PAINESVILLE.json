Conneaut soils have 20 to 35 percent clay in the subsoil and are on similar landscape positions. Harbor soils are moderately well drained and are on higher landscape positions. Kingsville soils are very poorly drained and are on lower landscape positions. Otisville and Tyner soils are excessively drained and are on adjacent higher beach ridge positions. Red Hook soils formed in outwash and are on nearby outwash plains. Stafford soils formed in glaciofluvial sands and are on nearby landscapes."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The taxonomic classification changed from Fine-loamy, mixed, nonacid, mesic Aeric Epiaquepts to Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, nonacid, mesic Aeric Epiaquepts. This is due to analysis of all laboratory data on the particle-size control sections of Painesville pedons and to updates contained in the 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Competing series have changed as similar soils were reclassified.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - from the surface to a depth of 9 inches (Ap horizon).\nAquic conditions - from a depth of 9 to 80 inches.\nCambic horizon - from a depth of 9 to 51 inches (Bg, Bw1, Bw2, 2Bw1 and 2Bw2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to sample numbers 13735 to 13740 for textural data on the typical pedon, from Ashtabula County, Ohio, and to pedon LK-26 for characterization data, sample numbers 20470 to 20476, from Lake County, Ohio; samples analyzed by the Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory, Columbus, Ohio.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
