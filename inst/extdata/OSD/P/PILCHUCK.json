  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice. The average annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F. The particle-size control section is sand, fine sand or loamy fine sand. Rock fragments in the control section range from 0 to 15 percent by weighted average. These soils have an irregular decrease in organic carbon. Reaction is neutral to moderately acid throughout. Some pedons have weak granular structure in the A horizon and are structureless below or are structureless throughout. The upper 40 inches of the pedon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5 moist, 3 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist or dry. Textures are loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sand or medium sand, and include gravelly sand in some subhorizon in the lower part of the control section of some pedons. The surface 5 to 9 inches is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in some pedons. The subhorizons below the control section have similar color and texture ranges, but range to very gravelly or extremely cobbly."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Birdsview and Greenwater series.  The Indianola, and Keystone series have similar classifications.   All of these soils have a regular decrease in organic carbon. In addition, Birdsview soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice. Greenwater soils have 5 to 25 percent ash and pumice in the particle-size control section. Keystone soils are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days following summer solstice."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pilchuck soils are on flood plains at elevations of about 10 to 800 feet. The soils formed in recent sandy and gravelly alluvium. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The average annual precipitation is 35 to 60 inches. The average January temperature is 37 degrees F., average July temperature is 62 degrees F., and average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is about 160 to 210 days."

Puyallup and Renton soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal. In addition, Briscot and Renton soils have an aquic moisture regime. Puyallup and Newberg soils have a mollic epipedon. Sultan soils are fine-silty. All these soils are on flood plains."
