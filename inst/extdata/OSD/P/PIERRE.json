  "OVERVIEW": "The Pierre series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in clayey residuum, or local alluvium over residuum, derived from shale bedrock.  Pierre soils are on gently sloping to rolling hillslopes on uplands on the Pierre Shale Plains (MLRA 60A).  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 381 mm (15 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (46 degrees F).",

Field observations of Pierre soils failed to reveal the presence of slickensides or wedge-shaped aggregates associated with Vertisols.\nThe typical pedon for the series is moved from Haakon County, South Dakota (MLRA 63A) to Custer County (MLRA 60A) with this update.  MLRA 63A is typic-ustic.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelvth Edition, 2013\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nTwenty-three pedons are in the KSSL database.  Many of these are grab samples.  None are from the type location.  Two complete samples are lab pedon id 87P0525 (field pedon id 87SD103001), and lab pedon id 40A2437 (field pedon id 57SD113009).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
