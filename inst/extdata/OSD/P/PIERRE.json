Field observations of Pierre soils failed to reveal the presence of slickensides or wedge-shaped aggregates associated with Vertisols.\nThe typical pedon for the series is moved from Haakon County, South Dakota (MLRA 63A) to Custer County (MLRA 60A) with this update.  MLRA 63A is typic-ustic.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelvth Edition, 2013\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nTwenty-three pedons are in the KSSL database.  Many of these are grab samples.  None are from the type location.  Two complete samples are lab pedon id 87P0525 (field pedon id 87SD103001), and lab pedon id 40A2437 (field pedon id 57SD113009).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
