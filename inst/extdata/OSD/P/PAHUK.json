  "REVDATE": "09/2006",
  "STATES": "NE",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pahuk series consists of very deep excessively drained soils formed in sandy alluvium and outwash material. These soils are on paleo valley side slopes and glaciated uplands with slopes of 5 to 17 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 74 centimeters (29 inches) and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. (52 degrees F.) at the type location.",
