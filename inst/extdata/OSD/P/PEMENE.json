  "OVERVIEW": "The Pemene series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy sand glacial till on ground moraines and end moraines.  These soils have moderately rapid or moderate permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 24 to greater than 60 inches. The solum ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part and from neutral to slightly alkaline in the lower part.  The C horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the upper part of the sola and from 5 to 30 percent in the BC and C horizons.  Volume of cobbles range from 0 to 15 percent throughout the profile. Stones covering the surface range from 0 to 1 percent.\nThe A horizon has 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR hue or is neutral; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 2.  Where present, the Ap horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value and chroma of 2 to 4.  The A or Ap is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has 5YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It has textures like the A or Ap horizon.  The E part of the E/B horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 6. It has textures similar to that of the E horizon.  The Bt portion of the E/B horizon has similar colors and textures as the Bt horizon. Clay content of the upper solum ranges from 3 to 15 percent and the content of particles coarser than very fine sand is more than 50 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has 5YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Clay content of the argillic horizon ranges from 10 to 18 percent. Some pedons that do not have Bt horizons have B/E horizons. Some pedons have E and Bt horizons below the B/E horizon.\nThe 2BC horizon has 5YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loamy sand, sandy loam or gravelly loamy sand.\nThe 2C horizon has 5YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand,sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs.  Small pockets of sand and gravel occur in some pedons."
