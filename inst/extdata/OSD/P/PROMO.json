  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Promo soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on slightly convex backslope positions with south or west-facing aspect.  Slopes are 5 to 60 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,300 to 6,800 feet.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from limestone with some areas weathered from sandstone and siltstone.  The climate is subhumid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches, the mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is about 69 F., and the frost-free period is 100 to 160 days."

Rozlee soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts, have mollic epipedons, and have calcic horizons.  Sandall are moderately deep to lithic contacts, have calcic horizons, and have carbonatic mineralogy.  Sanpete soils are very deep, have calcic horizons, and have carbonatic mineralogy."

Future study is needed to determine whether another series is needed with a xeric moisture regime to represent part of the current series concept.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
