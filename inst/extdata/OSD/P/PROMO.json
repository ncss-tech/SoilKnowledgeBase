  "OVERVIEW": "The Promo series consists of shallow, well drained or somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from limestone.  Promo soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 5 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Promo soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on slightly convex backslope positions with south or west-facing aspect.  Slopes are 5 to 60 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,300 to 6,800 feet.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from limestone with some areas weathered from sandstone and siltstone.  The climate is subhumid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches, the mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is about 69 F., and the frost-free period is 100 to 160 days."

Future study is needed to determine whether another series is needed with a xeric moisture regime to represent part of the current series concept.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
