  "OVERVIEW": "The Paradise series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium, mainly from limestone, on nearly level flood plains and alluvial flats.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches; mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F.",
