  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist and is saturated for prolonged periods during winter, but it is dry in all parts between a depth of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days during the summer. The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F. The thickness of the solum to the underlying clay ranges from 14 to 30 inches. Distinct redox concentrations are within 12 inches of the surface. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 24 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam with 20 to 27 percent clay. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe BA and Bw horizons have hue of 5Y to 10YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2C horizon or 2Bt horizon when present, has value of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 1 to 4 moist and dry. Texture is clay or gravelly clay with 60 to 70 percent clay. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral."

The soils formed in clayey alluvium overlain by recent silty slope alluvium. The average annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches. The climate is characterized by cool and wet winters and warm and dry summers. The average January temperature is 39 degrees F.and the average July temperature is 67 degrees F. The average annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F. The frost-free season is 160 to 235 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bellpine, Courtney, Hazelair, Natroy, Panther, and Sutherlin soils. Bellpine soils are well drained and have an argillic horizon. Courtney soils are poorly drained and have an argillic horizon underlain by skeletal alluvium within 40 inches. Sutherlin soils are fine-loamy over clayey, are moderately well drained and have ochric epipedons. Bellpine and Sutherlin soils are on adjacent side slopes of foothills. Courtney and Natroy soils are on adjacent terraces. Hazelair and Panther soils are in concave areas on side slopes of foothills."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features include:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 13 inches (Ap and BA horizons)\nCambic horizon - the zone from 13 to 21 inches (Bw horizon)\nAquic feature - the zone from 16 to 21 inches having aquic conditions for some time in most years and chroma of 2 with redox concentrations (lower part of the\nmollic epipedon)\nEpisaturation feature - the soil is saturated with water in one or more layers from the upper boundary of saturation (BA horizon) to 21 inches (2C1 horizon)\nVertic feature - the zone from 21 to 60 inches (2C1 and 2C2 horizons) having pressure faces, smectitic mineralogy, and an assumed linear extensibility of 6.0 or more. Series needs a review for \"vertic\" concept when clay layers are deeper than 24 inches.\nThe classification was changed from Typic Haplaquolls to Vertic Epiaquolls in 5/94. In the 2/84 revision, the family classification was changed to fine-silty over clayey. In the 12/2002 revision, the mineralogy was revised to mixed over smectitic. The increase in clay is greater than 26 percent (absolute) between the B and 2C horizons and the B horizon has less than 35 percent clay. The family mineralogy classification is changed to mixed. Mineralogy is to reflect the upper part of the contrasting particle-size control sections.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
