  "OVERVIEW": "The Purches series consists of moderately well drained to somewhat poorly drained soils formed in glacial till capped with a loess mantle.  They occur in slight depressions in glacial moraines and on muskeg borders and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual air temperature is 35 degrees F.",

The Grewingk soils have a thick organic mat on the surface and a spodic horizon that extends no deeper than 7 inches, and have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the 10 to 40 inch section. Homestead soils have spodic horizons without mottles. Lucile soils have a bisequal solum formed in silt loam loess 15 to 24 inches thick. Spenard soils have less than 35 percent gravel in the control section."
