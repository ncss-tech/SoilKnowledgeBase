The Grewingk soils have a thick organic mat on the surface and a spodic horizon that extends no deeper than 7 inches, and have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the 10 to 40 inch section. Homestead soils have spodic horizons without mottles. Lucile soils have a bisequal solum formed in silt loam loess 15 to 24 inches thick. Spenard soils have less than 35 percent gravel in the control section."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Purches soils occur in slight depressions in glacial moraines and on muskeg borders. They have slopes of 0 to 12 percent. Elevations are between 50 and 1000 feet. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 14 to 20 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 35 degrees F. The average frost-free period is about 115 days."

The Jacobsen soils are formed in very stony water worked material. The Kasilof soils have sandy-skeletal texture below 10 inches and the spodic horizon is not mottled."
