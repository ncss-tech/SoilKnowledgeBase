    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Penapon soils are on steep mountain slopes.  They formed in alluvial - colluvial material derived from limestone.  Slopes range from 8 to 75 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,000 to 7,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 24 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is about 100 to 140 days.  These soils are mainly on north aspect.  Precipitation occurs mainly as showers during July through September."

Monjeau soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 40 inches and are in higher positions in the landscape than Penapon soils.  Paco soils are in a fine family and are in lower positions in the landscape than Penapon soils.  Tortugas soils are shallow and are adjacent to Penapon soils."
