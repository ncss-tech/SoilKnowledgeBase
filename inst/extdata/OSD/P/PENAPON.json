  "OVERVIEW": "The Penapon series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvial-colluvial material derived from limestone.  These soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Elevation ranges from 6,000 to 7,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 24 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is about 100 to 140 days.  These soils are mainly on north aspect.  Precipitation occurs mainly as showers during July through September."
