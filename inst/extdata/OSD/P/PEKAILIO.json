  "OVERVIEW": "The Pekailio series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in basic volcanic ash deposited over `a`a lava. Pekailio soils are located on the slopes of Mauna Loa volcano.  Slopes range from 2 to 70 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 2,032 millimeters (80 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",
