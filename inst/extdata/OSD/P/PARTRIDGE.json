  "OVERVIEW": "The Partridge series consists of somewhat poorly drained soils that are moderately deep to a lithic contact with sandstone.  They formed in waterlaid or eolian sandy deposits on outwash plains, stream terraces, and some nearby upland areas.  Permeability is rapid in the sandy mantle and moderately slow or moderate in the sandstone.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of soil development  ranges from 20 to 40 inches and coincides with depth to sandstone. The particle-size control section averages less than 15 percent silt plus clay. Some pedons have up to 15 percent by volume of coarse fragments consisting of ironstone and sandstone channers and flagstones. Reaction naturally ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid throughout the soil but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.   Redox accumulations typically are throughout the soil below the Ap or A horizon. Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less and saturation occur within a depth of 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture of the A or Ap horizon is loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or fine sand.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 2 to 8.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. Typically it is weakly cemented sandstone. Some pedons have a Cr horizon, some pedons have an R horizon, and some have a Cr horizon which grades with depth to an R horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in sandy outwash or sandy eolian deposits overlying sandstone. Some pedons have the lower part of the solum or the substratum in sandy residuum weathered from sandstone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 35 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 48 degrees F."

The excessively drained Plainbo soils are in similar or slightly higher landscape positions contiguous to the Partridge soils. The well drained Elkmound soils occupy similar or slightly higher landscape positions contiguous to Partridge soils but have finer textured control sections and Elkmound soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to sandstone."

Some areas, which were used for cropland in the past, have been planted to pine trees or allowed to revert to native trees.  Native vegetation is principally jack pine, pin oak, and aspen."
