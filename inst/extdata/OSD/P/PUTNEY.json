  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free carbonates and accumulations of salt other than gypsum  ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Gypsum accumulations typically are at a depth of 14 to 30 inches.  The electrical conductivity ranges from 8 to 16 mmhos or more at a depth of 10 to 20 inches and from 4 to 12 mmhos or more below a depth of 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist.  It typically is silt loam, but is silty clay loam in some pedons.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam averaging between 18 and 30 percent clay.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  It has disseminated carbonate and in some pedons accumulations of carbonate.  The calcium carbonate equivalent percentage ranges from 10 to 40 percent.  The Bk horizon has common to many accumulations of salt and gypsum.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and typically is varved with very thin strata of very fine sand to clay. It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Varves range from 1 mm to 10 mm in thickness."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Brandt, Great Bend, Kranzburg, and Poinsett series in the same family.  All soils contain less salts above a depth of 20 inches.  In addition, Kranzburg soils have more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in particle size control section between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  Poinsett soils do not have accumulations of gypsum and other salts in the Bk horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Putney soils are on nearly level to gently sloping glacial lake plains.  Slope gradients are less than 2 percent.  The soils formed in silty, calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments of silt sized particles but with thin lens of fine sand or clay sized particles. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 20 inches.  Growing season is about 125 to 135 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 14 to 17 inches; and growing degree days are about 2600 to 3200."

Beotia and Great Bend soils are on similar positions to Putney soils.  Huffton and Zell soils are on the steeper slopes particularly along drainageways crossing the lake plain. Aberdeen, Exline, Harmony, and Nahon soils are on broad smooth flats. Aberdeen, Exline, and Nahon soils have a natric horizon, and Harmony soils have an argillic horizon.  Beotia and Gardena soils have mollic epipedons greater than 16 inches thick.  Doland soils are fine-loamy. The Eckman, Rothsay, and Zell soils are coarse-silty.  Huffton soils are coarse-silty and have carbonates at the surface.  Bearden soils have a calcic horizon and are at edges of swales and depressions. Tonka soils are in closed depressions and have a thick E horizon and an argillic horizon. Winship soils are in narrow shallow draws and have an argillic horizons."
