  "OVERVIEW": "The Pinelake series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in a loamy mantle and underlying sandy and gravelly outwash sediments on glacial outwash plains, lake terraces and moraines.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part and rapid in the lower part.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free carbonates ranges from 24 to 50 inches.  The thickness of the loamy mantle ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 20 inches in thickness.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the upper mantle and from 2 to 35 percent in the lower material.  Rock fragments are of mixed lithology and are typically pebble size.  A till substratum phase is recognized where glacial till occurs below depths of 60 inches.\nThe Ap and A horizon have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y or are neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 through 2.  They are sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  They are slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon.\nThe Btg horizon has a hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam or loam, but includes thin subhorizons of sandy clay loam.  The Btg horizon averages from 12 to 18 percent clay and 50 to 70 percent sand.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2Btg horizon has a hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or their gravelly analogues. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons have 2Bg or 2Bkg horizons\nThe 2Cg horizon has a hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, coarse sand or their gravelly analogues.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nWhere glacial till occurs below depths of 60 inches, a till substratum phase is recognized.  It has a 3Cg horizon with hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is  sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam and includes thin subhorizons of clay loam or sandy clay loam.
