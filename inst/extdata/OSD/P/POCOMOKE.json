In unlimed, areas the soil ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is loamy sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam, including a mucky modifier.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is loamy sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 7 and matrix chroma of 1 or 2 or it is neutral with value of 3 to 7.  Iron depletions are in shades of brown or gray and masses of oxidized iron are in shades of red brown or yellow. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam with less than 18 percent clay and less than 35 percent silt. Iron depletions are in shades of brown or gray and masses of oxidized iron are in shades of red brown or yellow.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 7 and chroma of 1 or 2, or it is neutral with value of 3 to 7. Texture is commonly loamy sand but may be stratified below 40 inches, ranging from sand to sandy clay loam. Iron depletions are in shades of brown or gray and masses of oxidized iron are in shades of red brown or yellow."

Similar soils in other families are the Bayboro, Byars, Cape Fear, Deloss, Fallsington, Hyde, Johnstown, Portsmouth, Roanoke, Rutlege, Torhunta, and Weeksville soils. The Bayboro, Byars, Cape Fear, Deloss, Fallsington, Hyde, Portsmouth and Roanoke soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle size control sections. Fallsington soils have mean annual soil temperatures of less than 59 degrees F. The Johnstown, Rutlege, Torhunta and Weeksville soils lack argillic horizons."
