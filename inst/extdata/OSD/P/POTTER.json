  "OVERVIEW": "The Potter series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy alluvium from the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age. Potter soils are on very gently sloping to steep draws, escarpments, or valley sides. Slopes range from 1 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 483 mm (19 in), and the mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
