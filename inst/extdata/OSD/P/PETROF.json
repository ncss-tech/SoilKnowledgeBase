Thickness of the loamy surface mantle ranges from 45 to greater than 60 inches over sand and gravel.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The pH of the solum ranges from 5.2 to 6.5.  The pH of the substratum increases with depth and ranges from 5.8 to 7.5.\nThe A horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are silt loam, or very fine sandy and commonly have thin strata of sand or loamy sand.\nThe C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  They are stratified silt loam, fine sandy loam, and loamy sand.\nThe Cg horizons have hue of 2.5Y to 5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 2.  They are stratified silt loam, fine sandy loam, and loamy sand.  The underlying material is very gravelly or extremely gravelly sand or loamy sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Petrof soils are formed in stratified loamy sediments over sand and gravel deposits on alluvial plains and low terraces.  In some areas recent tectonic activity has dropped these landforms several feet.  The lowest of these subsided areas are affected by saltwater intrusion.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Elevations are 20 to 150 feet.\nThe climate is maritime with mild winters and cool summers.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 65 to 75 inches and the mean annual snowfall is 50 to 100 inches.  Mean January temperature is 26 degrees F., mean July temperature is 55  degrees F., and the mean annual temperature ranges from 38  to 40 degrees F."

Chenega soils have a particle size control section that is sandy-skeletal and are on floodplains and alluvial fans.   Jakolof soils have spodic horizons and are on stream terraces and alluvial fans. Portdick soils occur in complex with Petrof soils."
