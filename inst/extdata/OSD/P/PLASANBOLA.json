  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. SCC/KP/GLP/BG",
  "REVDATE": "07/2002",
  "STATES": "PB",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Plasanbola series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and cinders from fallout. The Plasanbola soils are on the crests of ridges on the dissected backslopes and footslopes of stratovolcanic islands. Slopes range from 8 to 130 percent. The mean annual temperature is 27 degrees C. (81 degrees F.), and the mean annual precipitation is about 2032 millimeters (80 inches).",
