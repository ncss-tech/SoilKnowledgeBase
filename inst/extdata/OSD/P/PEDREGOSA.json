  "REVDATE": "10/2013",
  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Pedregosa series consists of very shallow and shallow to a hardpan, well drained soils that formed in mixed calcareous fan alluvium. Pedregosa soils are on fan remnant. Slope ranges from 3 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches (356 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F (17 degrees C).",
