These soils formed from mixed calcareous fan alluvium. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches (305 to 406 mm) and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January. The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 67 degrees F (14 to 19.4 degrees C). The frost-free period is 180 to 230 days."
