Bonnick and Gardone soils do not have cambic horizons or horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates and have ashy sandy textures in the particle-size control section. Borobey soils have firm, brittle horizons within 100 cm and do not have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates. Emamount soils do not have cambic horizons or horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates. Embal soils have mollic epipedons 50 to 90 cm thick and have irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth. Frentera, Stookmoor, and Wegert soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts. Oatmanflat and Tuffcabin soils have buried argillic horizons within 100 cm and buried duripans within 150 cm of the soil surface."
