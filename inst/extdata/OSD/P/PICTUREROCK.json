  "OVERVIEW": "The Picturerock series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from pumiceous volcanic ash. Picturerock soils are on lake terraces. Slopes are 1 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
