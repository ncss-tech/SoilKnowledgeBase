These soils formed in loess high in volcanic ash superimposed over alluvium or lacustrine materials derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,220 to 1,955 meters.  The climate cool, arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."
