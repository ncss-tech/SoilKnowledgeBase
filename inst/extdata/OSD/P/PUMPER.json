  "OVERVIEW": "The Pumper series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in loess high in volcanic ash superimposed alluvium or lacustrine materials derived from mixed rocks.  Pumper soils are on inset fans, alluvial fans, fan skirts, barrier bars and beach terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
