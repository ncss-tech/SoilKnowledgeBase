  "OVERVIEW": "The Pulpit series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material derived from sandstone.  Pulpit soils are on hills and mesas.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
