  "OVERVIEW": "The Potrmound series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on caldera floors. These soils formed in loess, volcanic ash and residuum from basalt. Permeability is moderately rapid. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F. Slopes are 4 to 35 percent.",
