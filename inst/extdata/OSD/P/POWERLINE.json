Gilland soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from red sandstone and calcareous shale and have hues of 2.5YR and 5YR.  In addition, Gallen soils are in the Pecos-Canadian Plains and Valleys; Polar soils are in the Central Rolling Red Plains; both soils are moist in May and June."

Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and winter rain.  Mean annual air temperature is 59 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 180 to 240 days."
