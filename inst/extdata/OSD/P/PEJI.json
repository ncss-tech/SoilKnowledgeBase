  "STATUS": "Established Series",

  "REVDATE": "12/2002",
  "STATES": "SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Peji series consists of moderately deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils on shoulders and upper back slopes of deeply dissected sandstone uplands.  They formed in material weathered from sandstone with additions of colluvium and eolian sands in places.  Slopes range from 15 to 85 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.; and mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Carbonates are typically leached below a depth of 40 inches.  Depth to soft sandstone ranges from 20 to 40 inches.   The C horizon contains 2 to 15 percent by volume of soft to hard sandstone fragments that range in size from 1/8 to 3 inches in size.  The fragments typically are calcareous.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is dominantly sand but may be loamy sand, fine sand or loamy fine sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have an AC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is fine sand, loamy fine sand or sand.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is weakly cemented sandstone that can be dug by spade with difficulty.  The sandstone is not always continuous in respect to depth and loose sand underlies the sandstone in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Duda, McKelvie, Royosa, Simeon, Tonalea and Valentine series.  Duda soils formed in eolian material and contain few or no sandstone fragments in the control section.  McKelvie, Royosa, Simeon and Valentine soils are very deep.  In addition, Royosa soils have a drier soil moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice.  Simeon soils average more than 35 percent medium and coarse sand in the control section and do not have sandstone fragments in the control section. Valentine soils formed in eolian materials and have few or no sandstone fragments in the pedon.  Tonalea soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Peji soils are generally on the drier south and west facing slopes of deeply dissected sandstone plains.  Slopes range from 15 to 85 percent.  The soils formed in materials weathered from soft sandstone with additions of colluvium and eolian sands.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 52 degrees F.; and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 23 inches.  Growing season ranges from 130 to 160 days; growing season precipitation is about 14 to 15 inches; and growing degree days ranges from 3000 to 3200."

The poorly drained Bigwinder soils, the excessively drained Inavale soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Yockey soils are on flood plains.  The Blula and McKelvie soils are very deep over soft sandstone and are on lower back slopes and footslopes below the Peji soil.  The Blula soil has a mollic epipedon."
