  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock and the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 7 to 16 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from about 47 to 53 degrees F.  EC is less than 4 mmhos throughout.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent pebbles throughout the soil but are typically less than 5 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5.  Texture is clay loam or loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 but less than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  The Bt is typically noncalcareous, but some pedons are calcareous due to recharge.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Btky horizon, when present, has the same color and textural range as the Bt horizon.  Pedogenetic accumulations of carbonates and gypsum occur as soft masses, filaments, and nests of crystals, respectively.  Reaction is typically mildly or moderately alkaline, but some pedons may be strongly alkaline when not buffered by excess gypsum.\nThe Bky horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is loam or clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay.  Pedogenetic accumulations of carbonates and gypsum occur as common soft masses, filaments, and as nests of crystals.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 6 to 15 percent.  Gypsum ranges from 2 to 6 percent.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline."

Bowbac and Cushman soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the Bt horizon and have a paralithic contact to soft sandstone.  Pugsley soils have more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the Bt horizon.  Fattig, Hagerman, Progresso, and Threetop soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Gaddes soils lack gypsum and have granite bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Los Alamos soils have pumice and ash at 20 to 40 inches and pumice gravel throughout the soil."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pokeman soils are on bedrock controlled uplands.  They formed in residuum and colluvial slopewash derived from gypsiferous bedrock.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 5,000 to 6,300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches with about half falling as snow and rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual air temperature is 43 to 46 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 100 to 130 days depending upon elevation, aspect, and air drainage."
