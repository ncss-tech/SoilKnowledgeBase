The soil moisture control section is moist, in all parts, from about December 1st to May 15th.  It is dry, in all parts, from August 1st to November 1st.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from May 1st to December 1st and exceeds 47 degrees F. from May 15 to October 15th.  The mollic epipedon is 22 to 36 inches thick and includes part or all of the B horizon.  Organic matter is 1 to 3 percent.  Clay content of the control section ranges from 20 to 25 percent and total sand ranges from 35 to 45 percent.  Some areas have about 10 to 20 percent cobbles or stones on the surface.\nThe A horizon is 5YR 5/2; 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/3; 7.5YR 4/2, 4/3, or 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2; 7.5YR 3/2; or 5YR 3/2.  It is gravelly loam, stony loam, very gravelly loam or cobbly sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 45 percent.  Structure of the upper part of the A horizon is strong or moderate coarse or very coarse platy or is strong medium granular.\nThe B horizon is 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4; 5YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/3, or 5/4.
