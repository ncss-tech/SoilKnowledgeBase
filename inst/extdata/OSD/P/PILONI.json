  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "DHC/SSP",
  "REVDATE": "11/1999",
  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Piloni series consist of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from granite, granodiorite, granodiorite gneiss, or quartz monzonite.  These soils are on mountain slopes mostly with south and west facing aspects.  Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
