  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum is more than 30 inches. Depth to the 2B horizon ranges from 14 to 36 inches. The average clay content of the 10 to 40 inch control section ranges from 60 to 85 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. In some pedons, where the A horizon is less than 10 inches thick, hue is 7.5YR or 5YR, and chroma is 2 or 3; or hue is 10YR, value is 3, and chroma is 1. Texture is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bssg horizon has value of 4 to 6. Mottles in shades of brown range from few to many. Mottles in shades of red are few. Clay content ranges from 55 to 85 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe upper part of the 2B horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline. Fine or medium concretions of carbonates range from none to many. Redoximorphic concentrations and depletions are in shades of brown and gray.\nThe lower part of the 2B horizon or the 2Ck horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is calcareous and contains few to many fine to coarse concretions of carbonates. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline. Redoximorphic concentrations and depletions are in shades of brown and gray."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Harahan and Sharkey series in the same family and the Alligator, Beaumont, Garner, Portland, and Tuscumbia series. Alligator soils are more acid and lack reddish material within the 10 to 40 inch control section. Beaumont and Garner soils have intersecting slickensides and lack red material within the control section. Harahan soils have a fluid underlying material. Portland soils lack low chroma colors in the upper part of the cambic horizon. Sharkey soils are more alkaline in the upper part and lack reddish material within 42 inches. Tuscumbia soils have mixed mineralogy and lack reddish material within the 10 to 40 inch control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Perry soils are on level to gently undulating slopes in backswamp areas along the Arkansas and Red Rivers and their distributaries. The regolith is clayey alluvium. Montmorillonite is the dominant clay mineral. Perry soils are flooded for short periods nearly every year unless protected by levees. The climate is warm and humid. The mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 68 degrees F. and average annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 60 inches."

Buxin soils have mollic epipedons and subsurface layers in shades of gray. Hebert soils are on ridges at higher elevations, lack gray colors and are loamy throughout. Latanier soils have mollic epipedons and loamy subsurface layers and lack gray colors. Moreland soils have mollic epipedons and are reddish throughout. Rilla soils have Bt horizons that contain 18 to 30 percent clay and lack gray colors."
