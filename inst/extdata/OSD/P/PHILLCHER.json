Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (Bw horizon); a cambic horizon from 10 to 24 inches (2Bw horizon); an ash influenced layer from the soil surface to 10 inches that has a moist bulk density of 1.0 g/cc or less (Bw horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (2Bw, 2C horizons). Phillcher soils have a cryic temperature regime and a udic moisture regime.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Andic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Andic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
