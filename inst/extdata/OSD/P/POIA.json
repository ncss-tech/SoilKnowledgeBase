  "OVERVIEW": "The Poia series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in outwash, till or mass movement deposits derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock. Poia soils are commonly found on landslides, moraines or depressions on glacial-valley floors. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1,000 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C.",
