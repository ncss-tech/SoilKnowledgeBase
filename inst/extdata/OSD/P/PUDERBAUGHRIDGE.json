The pedon was described by Bob Ottersberg in 1999. It was assigned to the aridic soil moisture regime, but it does not align with the typical precipitation levels of that regime. The estimated precipitation for the series was lowered, but it is still high for the aridic moisture regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
