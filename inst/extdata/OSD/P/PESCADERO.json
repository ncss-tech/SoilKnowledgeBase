    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Pescadero soils have redoximorphic features less than 20 inches below the surface.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from about 59 degrees to 62 degrees F.  The solum ranges from about 36 to 76 inches in thickness.\nThe An horizon has dry colors of 10YR 7/2, 6/2, 5/2; 2.5Y 7/2, 6/2 or 5/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 5/2, 4/2; 2.5Y 4/2 or 3/2.  It is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam or clay.  It is medium acid to strongly alkaline inclusive.  The Ca/Mg ratio is 0.3/1.0 to 1.0/1.0.  Where the soil has an Ap horizon, it lacks natural soil structure but clods or fragments of the horizon have light gray coatings.\nThe Btng horizon has dry colors of 10YR 5/2, 5/1, 4/2, 4/1; 2.5Y 5/2, 4/2; N5/, N4/; 5Y 5/1 or 4/1.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/2, 3/2; 2.5Y 4/2, 3/2; or 5Y 3/1.  It is clay or silty clay and has moderate or strong prismatic structure.  The exchangeable sodium content is 15 to 70 percent.\nThe Btkng horizon has dry colors of 10YR 6/3, 6/2; 2.5Y 7/2, 6/2; N6/, N5/; 5Y 6/3, 6/2, 6/1, 5/2 or 5/1.  Moist colors are 7.5YR 4/4; 5Y 4/3, 4/2, 4/1 or 3/2.  It contains distinct or prominent redoximorphic features and the upper part of the horizon is also mottled in some pedons.  It is clay or silty clay.  The lower part of the B horizon commonly has angular blocky structure but in some pedons it has prismatic structure.  The horizon ranges from moderately alkaline through strongly alkaline and alkalinity tends to increase as depth increases.  The horizon contains segregated lime mostly in the lower part.  The exchangeable sodium is 15 to 55 percent in the upper part and 5 to 15 in the lower part.\nWhen present, the Bt horizon has dry colors of 10YR 7/4, 7/3, 7/2, 6/4, 6/3, 6/2; 2.5Y 7/4, 7/2, 6/4, 6/2, 5/2; 5Y 6/2 or 6/1.  Moist colors are 10YR 5/6, 4/3; 2.5Y 4/2; or 5Y 4/2.  Distinct or prominent redoximorphic features are in the upper part of some horizons.  The horizon ranges from silt loam through silty clay and is moderately to strongly alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pescadero soils are in level basins at elevations of 5 to 100 feet.  They formed in alluvium from sedimentary rocks.  They are in areas that have a dry subhumid mesothermal climate.  Summer is hot and dry and winter is cool and moist.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 19 inches.  Mean annual temperature about 60 to 61 degrees F., average January temperature about 45 degrees F., and average July temperature about 77 degrees F.  Frost-free period is from 250 to 320 days."
