  "OVERVIEW": "The Pescar series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in stratified calcareous alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Pescar soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches (510 mm) and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F. (5.5 deg. C).",

(Cg and 2C horizons)\nRedox depletions:  The zone from 20 to 56 cm. (Cg horizon)\nEndosaturation:  The presence of an apparent water table (upper boundary) at 20 cm during the months of March to June.\nParticle size control section:  The zone from 25 to 100 cm. (parts of the Cg and 2C horizons)\nA revision in 06/2002 changed the depth to saturation from 46 to 76 cm, to 20 to 50 cm. This restricted this soil to the Aquic subgroup, and excludes Oxyaquic.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Classified according to the Eighth Edition, 1998"
