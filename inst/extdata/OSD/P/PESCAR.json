(A horizon)\nAquic feature: Based on redox depletions and seasonal saturation, 20 to 56 cm horizon (Cg horizon)\nRedox concentrations:  The zone from 20 to 152 cm. (Cg and 2C horizons)\nRedox depletions:  The zone from 20 to 56 cm. (Cg horizon)\nEndosaturation:  The presence of an apparent water table (upper boundary) at 20 cm during the months of March to June.\nParticle size control section:  The zone from 25 to 100 cm. (parts of the Cg and 2C horizons)\nA revision in 06/2002 changed the depth to saturation from 46 to 76 cm, to 20 to 50 cm. This restricted this soil to the Aquic subgroup, and excludes Oxyaquic.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Classified according to the Eighth Edition, 1998\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
