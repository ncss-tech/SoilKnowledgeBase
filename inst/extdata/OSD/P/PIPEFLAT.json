  "OVERVIEW": "The Pipeflat series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sand over alluvium derived from granite. The Pipeflat soils are on sand sheets over fan remnants and have slopes of 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 67 degrees F.",
