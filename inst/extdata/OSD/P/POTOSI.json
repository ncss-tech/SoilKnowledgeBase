The soils have a typic-aridic soil moisture regime.\nSoil temperature: 12 to 14 degrees C. (53 to 58 degrees F.).\nDepth to lithic contact: 20 to 36 centimeters (8 to 14 inches).\nCalcium carbonate equivalent in the fine earth fraction: 15 to 30 percent; 40 to 60 percent in the less-than-20-millimeter fraction.\nControl section\nPercent clay: 8 to 15 percent.\nRock fragments: 50 to 80 percent, 50 to 70 percent gravel, and 0 to 10 percent cobbles and stones.\nA horizon:\nValue: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nBk horizons:\nValue: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma: 3 or 4.\nTexture: Loam or sandy loam.\nStructure: Weak, fine or medium subangular blocky.\nConsistence: Nonsticky or slightly sticky and nonplastic or slightly plastic.\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates: Few through many thin calcium carbonate coats and pendants on rock fragments. Few or common fine soft masses of calcium carbonate in the lower Bk horizon. The zone containing more than 5 percent (by volume) identifiable secondary calcium carbonates is less than 15 centimeters (6 inches) thick and does not qualify as a calcic horizon."

(47 to 52 degrees F.), 35 to 50 percent rock fragments, and 15 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Koynik soils are not moist in some part for short periods between July and October due to rain from convective storms. Sheepass soils have more than 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalence in the fine earth fraction. Theriot soils have dominantly cobbles or stones and have less than 50 percent gravel in the particle-size control section."
