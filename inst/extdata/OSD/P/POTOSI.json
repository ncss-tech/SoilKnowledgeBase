  "OVERVIEW": "The Potosi series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone. Potosi soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 millimeters (9 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C. (53 degrees F.).",

(53 to 58 degrees F.).\nDepth to lithic contact: 20 to 36 centimeters (8 to 14 inches).\nCalcium carbonate equivalent in the fine earth fraction: 15 to 30 percent; 40 to 60 percent in the less-than-20-millimeter fraction.\nControl section\nPercent clay: 8 to 15 percent.\nRock fragments: 50 to 80 percent, 50 to 70 percent gravel, and 0 to 10 percent cobbles and stones.\nA horizon:\nValue: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nBk horizons:\nValue: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma: 3 or 4.\nTexture: Loam or sandy loam.\nStructure: Weak, fine or medium subangular blocky.\nConsistence: Nonsticky or slightly sticky and nonplastic or slightly plastic.\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates: Few through many thin calcium carbonate coats and pendants on rock fragments. Few or common fine soft masses of calcium carbonate in the lower Bk horizon. The zone containing more than 5 percent (by volume) identifiable secondary calcium carbonates is less than 15 centimeters (6 inches) thick and does not qualify as a calcic horizon."
