  "OVERVIEW": "The Lionhead series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly residuum derived dominantly from mica schists and amphibolites.  These soils are on mountain sides.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the profile and rapid below.  Slopes range from 20 to 55 percent.  Average annual precipitation is 22 inches and the average annual temperature is 38 degrees F.",
