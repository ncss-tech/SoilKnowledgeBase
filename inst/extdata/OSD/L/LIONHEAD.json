Campone soils also are somewhat poorly drained and have mottles within a depth of 40 inches.  Caballo soils have a 0 horizon.  Croesus, Dateman, Nagitsy, Namela, Nevtah, and Prong soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Darland soils have an average annual soil temperature of more than 43 degrees F. and have a slightly acid B horizon.  Hobacker soils lack a \"Bw\" horizon and have a lithological discontinuity.  Marcetta soils have an \"E\" horizon and lack Bk horizons.  Nazaton soils have 0 horizons, lack layers of carbonates and have an average annual soil temperature of greater than 42 degrees F.  Poleline soils lack layers of carbonates.  Povey soils have no carbonates above 40 inches."
