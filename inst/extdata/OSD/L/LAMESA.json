  "OVERVIEW": "The Lamesa series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in recent sandy eolian deposits over loamy lacustrine deposits of Holocene and Pleistocene age. These nearly level soils are on the floor of playa basins that are 1.5 to 9 meters (5 to 30 feet) below the surrounding plain and range in size from 5 acres to more than 25 acres. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 483 millimeters (19 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",

Around the margins, where ponding occurs for shorter periods, the woody vegetation includes saltcedar, Tamarix and Baccharis being the two most prevalent species, and western willow.
