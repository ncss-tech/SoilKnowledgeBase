Vegetation varies according to the amount of water available and includes smartweed, sedges, spike rush, bur ragweed, and saltmarsh aster. In areas of standing water, southern cattail, soft-stem bulrush, and longbarb arrowhead may be present. Around the margins, where ponding occurs for shorter periods, the woody vegetation includes saltcedar, Tamarix and Baccharis being the two most prevalent species, and western willow.
