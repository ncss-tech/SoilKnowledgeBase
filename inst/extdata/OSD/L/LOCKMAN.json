  "OVERVIEW": "The Lockman series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from igneous rock.  Lockman soils are on mountainsides and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  The average annual precipitation is about 510 millimetrs, and the average annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",

Arkson soils lack a cambic horizon have 20-35 percent rock fragments and occur in a 760 to 1015 millimeters precipitation.  Branham and Sawcreek are moderately deep to bedrock.  Clergern soils have 5YR and redder colors and a base saturation of more than 75 percent.  Coski soils have a cambic that is 38 to 64 cm thick with few clay films.  Dinnen soils have a layer immediately under the surface layer that is extremely hard when dry. Sula soils are very fine, sandy loam or silt loam in the upper part of the control section and are moderately permeable.  Teoculli soils lack a cambic, are moderately permeable and have less than 35 percent fine sand and coarse."
