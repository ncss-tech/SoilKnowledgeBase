  "OVERVIEW": "The Lockman series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in\nresiduum and colluvium from igneous rock.  Lockman soils are on\nmountainsides and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent.  Permeability is\nmoderately rapid.  The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches,\nand the average annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
