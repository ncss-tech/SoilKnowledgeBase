    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 58 to 64 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches or more.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent in the A and Bt horizons and from 15 to 50 percent in the Btk and Bk horizons.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 14 to 55 inches, but it is typically 20 to\n40 inches.  Depth to lime ranges from 15 to 46 inches.  The Bt horizons are leached. Lime is leaches to the top of the Btk horizon, when present, or at the top of the Bk horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon is clay loam or clay.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  It has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Btk and Bk horizons are very cobbly sandy clay loam, cobbly or very gravelly clay loam, or extremely gravelly clay loam.  They have hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 through 8, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline."

Burnac soils have an E horizon abruptly over the argillic horizon.  Dandrea soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Silesca soils have a lithic contact above 40 inches.  Bario and Iles soils have a calcic horizon.  Siesta soils have cinders above the bedrock and lack calcium carbonate as pendants on coarse fragments above the bedrock.  Spud soils have a solum depth from 40 to greater than 60 inches."
