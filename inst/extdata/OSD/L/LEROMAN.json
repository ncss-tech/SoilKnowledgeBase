Bullvaro, Dooh, Nutval, and Vetagrande soils have an aridic moisture regime.  Burchflat and Vipont soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Chrisflat, Dogbed, Krenka, Murain, Snyderville, Softback, and Softscrabble soils are very deep.  Erig soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Lockgate soils are deep to paralithic contacts.  Staberg soils have argillic horizons that are 15 to 30 cm thick, have the upper boundary of the argillic horizon at depths of 36 to 64 cm from the soil surface, and have C horizons overlying the paralithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Leroman soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on footslope and backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,985 to 2,750 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 410 to 610 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 58 cm (A, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 13 to 86 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 86 cm to underlying soft bedrock (Cr layer).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 109 cm (R horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 13 to 63 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons and part of the Bt3 horizon).\nThe revision of October 2003 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Pachic Argixerolls.  The isotic mineralogy class was based solely on the field determined values for sodium fluoride pH.  Laboratory data on 15 bar water to clay ratio does not exist to verify the isotic mineralogy class.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
