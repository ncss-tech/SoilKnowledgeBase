  "OVERVIEW": "The Leroman series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Leroman soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 58 cm (A, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 13 to 86 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 86 cm to underlying soft bedrock (Cr layer).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 109 cm (R horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 13 to 63 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons and part of the Bt3 horizon).\nThe revision of October 2003 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Pachic Argixerolls.  The isotic mineralogy class was based solely on the field determined values for sodium fluoride pH.  Laboratory data on 15 bar water to clay ratio does not exist to verify the isotic mineralogy class."
