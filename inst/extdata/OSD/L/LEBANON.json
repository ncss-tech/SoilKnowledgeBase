  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the fragipan ranges from 18 to 26 inches.  Rock fragments larger than 3 inches in diameter range from 0 to 5 percent above the fragipan and 0 to 10 percent in and below the fragipan.  Rock fragments less than 3 inches in diameter range from 0 to 20 percent above the fragipan with the highest content being just above the fragipan, 5 to 70 percent in the fragipan and 5 to about 60 percent in the clayey residuum below the fragipan.  The reaction is medium acid to slightly acid in the surface soil and very strongly acid or strongly acid below.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. Undisturbed areas have A horizons with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3 and are commonly 2 to 4 inches thick.  Some pedons have E horizons.  It commonly is silt loam but may be gravelly silt loam in some pedons.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is commonly silt loam or silty clay loam, but may be gravelly in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 6.  Chroma is typically 3 to 6, but may be 2 just above the fragipan.  Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay or their gravelly analogues.\nThe 2Ex, 2Bx, and 2Btx horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2, or are mottled in hues of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, values of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 8.  They are silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam or their gravelly or extremely gravelly analogues.\nThe 2Bt and 3Bt horizons have hue of 10YR to 2.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. They are silty clay, clay, or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Lebanon soils occupy gently to moderately sloping upland positions with gradients of 2 to 14 percent but gradients commonly are 2 to 6 percent.  The regolith consists of approximately 18 to 26 inches of loess underlain by cherty limestone residuum.  The contact of the contrasting material is marked by a cherty old erosional surface in which the fragipan has developed.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 48 inches."

The Captina and Needleye soils have less clay above the fragipan and are found on similar landscapes.  Clarksville and  Coulstone soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section, and occur on steeper side slopes.  Hobson soils are fine-loamy and are on similar landscapes.  Nixa and Wilderness soils have less clay, more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section and are on similar landscapes."

    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly classified as Alfisols, but the majority of lab data shows that they best classify as Ultisols.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 9 inches (Ap and BE horizons).\nargillic horizon - the zone from approximately 9 inches to 23 inches and 35 to 60 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons and 2Bt1, 2Bt2, and 2Bt3 horizons).\nfragipan - the zone from approximately 23 to 35 inches (2Ex and 2Bx horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: University of Missouri soil characterization laboratory reference number M9016145.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
