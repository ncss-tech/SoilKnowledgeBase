  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to carbonates range from 20 to 60 inches. Volume of rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent by volume in the A and E horizons, 2 to 20 percent in the upper Bt horizon and 10 to 35 percent in the lower Bt and C horizons. Most rock fragments are pebbles .25 to 1.5 inches in diameter. The soil moisture control section is not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days in most years. Some areas have .01 to 3 percent of the surface covered by cobbles, stones, or boulders.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy fine sand, or sandy loam. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral. In cultivated areas all or parts of the E horizon have been incorporated into the Ap horizon.\nSome pedons have E&Bt, BE or E/B horizons. However, the E part of the E/B horizon occupies less than 15 percent of the matrix.\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or their gravelly analogues. Included are subhorizons that are sandy clay loam, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, loam, or their gravelly analogues. The argillic horizon averages between 8 to 18 percent clay and 55 to 83 sand. In some subhorizons there are more than 35 percent rock fragments but it averages less than 35 percent. The Bt horizon is composed of either continuous or discontinuous horizons or layers with a composite thickness greater than 3 inches. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a 2Bt horizon\nSome pedons have a BC or Bw horizon.\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon with hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 2 to 6. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, coarse sand, or their gravelly analogues. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has a hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 2 to 6. It is sand, coarse sand or their gravelly analogues. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Boyette soils are dry in some or all parts of the soil moisture control section for more than 90 cumulative days in most years. The Holdingford and Rockwood soils do not have sandy or gravelly textures in the lower part of the series control section. The Nitche soils have loamy textures in the lower third of the series control section. The Sybil soils averages less than 10 percent rock fragments in the series control section."

The well drained Almora soils are on similar positions in the landscape and have a thicker loamy mantle over the sand and gravels. The moderately well drained Bluffcreek soils are on foot slopes. The somewhat excessively drained Two Inlets and Eagleview soils are on similar position in the landscape. The poorly drained Epoufette and Pinelake soils are in shallow depressions or along the edges of deep depressions of organic soils. The well drained Sybil soils are on similar positions in the landscape and formed in outwash with less rock fragments. The very poorly drained Seelyeville soils are in deep depressions."
