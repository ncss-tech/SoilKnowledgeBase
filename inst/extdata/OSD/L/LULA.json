Soils in similar families are Armistead, Ashwood, Benklin, Claremore, Clareson, Fitzhugh, Newtonia, Nowata, Okay, and Reelfoot series.  Armistead, Benklin, and Reelfoot soils have wetness mottles within 16 inches of the surface.  Ashwood soils have a fine control section.  Caspiana, Deepwater, Mason Mer Rouge, Newtonia, and Tiptonville soils have a solum more than 60 inches thick.  Catoosa, Claremore, and Clareson soils have a solum less than 40 inches thick.  In addition, Clareson soils have a clayey-skeletal control section.  Dardanelle soils do not have bedrock within 60 inches of the surface.  Fitzhugh and Okay soils have a fine-loamy control section.  Nowata soils have a loamy-skeletal control section."

The soils formed in material weathered form limestone of Pennsylvanian age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1143 mm (37 to 45 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 13.8 to 17.7 degrees C (57 to 64 degrees F).  Elevation is 165 to 395 meters (541 to 1295 feet) above mean sea level.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices is more than 64."
