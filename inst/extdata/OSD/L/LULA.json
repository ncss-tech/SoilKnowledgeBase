  "OVERVIEW": "The Lula series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from limestone of Pennsylvanian age.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping uplands in the Cherokee Prairies.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",
