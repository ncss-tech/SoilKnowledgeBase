  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lavaspring soils are on stream terraces and flood plains.  They formed in alluvium derived mainly from mixed igneous rocks such as granodiorite, tuff, and andesite, minor amounts of metamorphic rock such as quartzite, and surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 7,000 to 9,000 feet.  The climate is continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 25 inches, the mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."

Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent.  Some areas of these soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for brief periods between December and June."
