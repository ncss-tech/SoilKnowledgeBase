  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 50 inches and depth to hard rock exceeds 60 inches. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid, except where the surface has been limed. Some pedons contain a few ironstone fragments. Colors in shade of gray are derived from parent material and not indicative of wetness.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10R, value of 4 or 6, and chroma 2 to 4. Texture is loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, or their gravelly, channery or flaggy analogues.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. In severely eroded areas, the Ap horizon has color and texture similar to the upper part of the Bt horizon. Texture has the same range as the A horizon.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles in shades of brown, yellow, olive and red range from none to common. Texture is clay loam, sandy clay, or clay. A thin Bt1 horizon with texture of sandy clay loam or clay loam is present in some pedons.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8; or there is no dominant color and is multicolored or variegated in shades of red, yellow, and brown. Mottles in shades of brown, yellow, olive and red range from none to common. Some pedons have shades of gray that are derived from shaley parent material. Content or mica flakes ranges from few to common.  Texture is clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.\nThe BC horizon has colors similar to those of the lower part of the Bt horizon. Platy rock structure ranges from none to 50 percent with individual plates having variable length and ranging in thickness from 1 mm to 8 mm. Texture is clay loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon is composed of stratified marine sediments rich in mica. Colors are variable but generally the sandier-textured strata have hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR with value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 5 to 8. Texture of the individual strata range from loamy sand to clay. Clayey strata are generally in shades of gray. Thickness of strata ranges from a few millimeters to several centimeters or more. Some pedons have thin lenses of ironstone in the upper part of the C horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Luverne soils are on dissected landscapes of the Southern Coastal Plain. Slopes range from 1 to 45 percent. They formed in marine sediments deposited as stratified sands, silts and clays. The climate is humid subtropical. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches."

Arundel soils are on lower positions and are moderately deep to soft siltstone bedrock.  The moderately well drained Boswell soils are on similar positions, have vertic properties and are Alfisols. The moderately well drained Conecuh soils are on lower slopes and have smectitic mineralogy. Greenville soils are on higher positions and have rhodic colors and kaolinitic mineralogy. Ruston and Smithdale soils are on similar to higher positions and have fine-loamy control sections. The somewhat excessively drained Troup soils are on higher positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches in thickness."
