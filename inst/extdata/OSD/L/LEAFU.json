  "OVERVIEW": "The Leafu series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on valley floors. These soils formed in fine-textured alluvium derived from weathered basic igneous rock. Slope is 0 to 3 percent. Elevation is near sea level to 250 feet. The mean annual rainfall is about 200 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F.",
