  "OVERVIEW": "The Leadville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in thick colluvium, alluvium, or glacial debris derived from gneiss, schist, and sedimentary rocks.  Leadville soils are on mountain slopes, alluvial fans, and terraces. Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 36 degrees F.",
