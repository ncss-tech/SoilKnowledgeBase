  "OVERVIEW": "The Luckymine series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from phyllite, schist, and other metasedimentary rocks. The Luckymine soils are on hills. Slopes range from 8 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 800 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C.",
