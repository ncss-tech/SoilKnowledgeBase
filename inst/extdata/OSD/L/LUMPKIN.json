  "OVERVIEW": "The Lumpkin series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in mixed tephra and residuum and colluvium from basalt.  Lumpkin soils are on ridgetops and sideslopes in volcanic Sierra Nevada mountains.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches, (2032 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F, (11 degrees C).",
