  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from about 23 to 48 inches and clay content increases slightly with depth.  The soils have ochric epipedons, cambic horizons; are usually dry in all parts between 10 to 40 inches; and soil temperature is 59 degrees F. or greater.  The A horizons range in color from grayish brown to dark grayish brown (10YR) dry, and very dark grayish brown to very dark brown moist; in texture from fine sandy loam to loam; and in thickness from 10 to 29 inches.  The B2 horizons range in color from brown to grayish brown dry, to dark brown to dark yellowish brown moist; in texture from loam to sandy loam, in reaction from slightly to medium acid; and in thickness from 12 to 22 inches."

The Amador soils have very pale, very strongly acid A horizons and bedrock occurs at 12 inches.  Butte soils have light brownish gray gravelly loam A horizons and strongly acid argillic horizons.  The Forward soils have light brownish gray, slightly and medium acid A horizons and very pale brown B2 horizons that are strongly acid in the lower part.  The Jiggs soils have stony loam A horizons and strongly acid C horizons.  The Kidd soils have pale brown gravelly sandy loam A horizons, strongly acid B2 horizons and bedrock occurs at 15 inches.  The Pentz soils are slightly acid and have bedrock at 14 inches."

Elevations range from 500 to 2,000 feet and the climate is subhumid to sermiarid mesothermal with mean annual rainfall of 20 to 45 inches, with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F., average January temperature about 46 degrees F., and average July temperature about 75 degrees F."
