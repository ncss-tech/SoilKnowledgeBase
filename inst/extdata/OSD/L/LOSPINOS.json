  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lospinos series consists of moderately deep to soft bedrock, moderately well drained soils that formed from shale from uplifted marine deposits. Lospinos soils are on hills of islands. Slopes range from 2 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches (457 millimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F (19 degrees C).",
