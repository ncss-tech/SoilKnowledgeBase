  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lonecabin soils are on alluvial fans, fan piedmonts and outwash terraces. They typically occur on summit positionsThey formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources such as metamorphic, volcanic and granitic rock. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 16,650 to 2,075 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 70 to 90 days."
