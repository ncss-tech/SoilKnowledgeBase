Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 5,000 to 7,300 feet.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring and cool in summer.  Average annual precipitation is 10 to 16 inches.  Average annual temperature is 32 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 5 to 70 days."

Copperbasin soils are on floodplains, lack histic epipedons and are somewhat poorly drained.  Grandjean soils are on floodplains, are very poorly drained and have organic layers 20 to 40 inches thick.  Fezip soils are on floodplains and have contrasting particle-size control sections. Redfish soils are on floodplains, are poorly drained and have organic layers less than 6 inches thick.  Wiggleton soils are on floodplains and alluvial fans and are well drained or somewhat excessively drained."
