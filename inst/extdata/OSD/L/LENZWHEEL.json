  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Isolated peds of relict genetic horizons of pre-mined soils are randomly distributed throughout, and are disordered relative to any plane in the profile.  Content ranges from 5 to 15 percent by volume.  Some of the peds have identifiable properties such as redox concentrations, clay films or other coatings that are characteristic of their previous formation.  The organic carbon content decreases irregularly with depth. The particle size control section ranges from 18 to 35 percent clay.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe upper part of the series control section (A and AC horizons) has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It commonly is silty clay loam but includes silt loam and loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons do not have an AC horizon.\nThe lower part of the series control section (C horizon) has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silt loam, or loam.  Thin strata or small pockets of coarser or finer textured material are in some pedons.  Individual layers within the C horizon are variable in number and thickness.  Rock fragment content generally increases below a depth of about 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Lenzburg series. Schuline series is in a closely related family. Lenzburg soils have more than 5 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section that are 3 inches in diameter or larger. Schuline soils have a superactive cation-exchange activity class."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lenzwheel soils are on summits and side slopes of ridges on reconstructed upland landscapes.  Slope ranges from 1 to greater than 60 percent.  These soils formed in cast overburden material from surface mining that consists of a mixture of glacial till and loess with a few rock fragments.  Mean annual temperature varies from 50 to 54 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation varies from 35 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Lenzburg and Schuline soils on surface mined areas, and the Fayette, Hickory, Keomah, Rozetta, and Wakeland soils on adjacent unmined areas.  Lenzburg and Schuline soils are nearby in similar positions on the landscape.  Keomah and Rozetta soils are on summits of ridges and Fayette soils are on side slopes.  Hickory soils are on backslopes along drainageways.  The somewhat poorly drained Wakeland soils are on flood plains."
