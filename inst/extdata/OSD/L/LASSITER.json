Where moist, values, are\nless than 3.5 the horizon is less than 7 inches thick.  Texture is mainly silt loam or loam but includes silty clay loam.  Reaction\nis slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), light gray (10YR 7/2), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), brown (10YR 4/3, 5/3), or\npale brown (10YR 6/3).  Few or common mottles of grayish brown and yellowish brown are present.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.  Clay content of the 10- to 40-inch control section\nranges from 18 to 30 percent and less than 15 percent sand that is coarser than very fine sand.  Bedding planes range from few to\nmany.  Reaction is medium acid through neutral.\nThe Ab horizon, where present, is 1 or 2 units of value lower than the overlying material.  It contains few to common mottles of\ngray, grayish brown, or yellowish brown, and it is silt loam or\nloam and is medium acid through neutral.\nA B2tb horizon is commonly below a depth of 40 inches.  It is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2),\ngrayish brown (10YR 5/2), or brown (10YR 4/2), with common fine\nand medium mottles of gray, brown, and yellow in hues of 7.5YR or 10YR.  Texture is mainly clay loam but includes loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction is strongly acid through neutral."

Other similar series are the Adler, Belden, Bruin,\nCascilla, Chenneby, Clemville, Collins, Commerce, Coushatta, Kemp, Keo, Lynnville, Norwood, Retrop, and Varro series.  Adler, Bruin, Collins, and Keo soils have less than 18 percent clay in the\ncontrol section.  Belden, Cascilla, Chenneby, Commerce, and\nCoushatta soils have cambic horizons.  In addition, Cascilla and Coushatta soils lack mottles of chroma 2 or less within 20 inches\nof the surface.  Chenneby soils are more acid.  Clemville,\nNorwood, Retrop, and Varro soils are calcareous and lack mottles\nof chroma 2 or less within 20 inches of the surface.  Kemp soils\nhave fine-loamy control sections.  Lynnville soils have mollic epipedons."
