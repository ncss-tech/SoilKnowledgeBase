The mean annual temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 55 percent rock fragments mostly pebbles less than 1 inch in diameter and the fine earth fraction averages 5 to 15 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.  Below 10 inches, the texture is gravelly loam or very gravelly loam.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Texture is very gravelly loam or gravelly loam.  Coarse fragments range from 25 to 60 percent.
