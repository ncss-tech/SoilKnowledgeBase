It is moderately acid or slightly acid.  Below 10 inches, the texture is gravelly loam or very gravelly loam.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Texture is very gravelly loam or gravelly loam.  Coarse fragments range from 25 to 60 percent.
