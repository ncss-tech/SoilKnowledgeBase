  "OVERVIEW": "The Landavaso series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in gravelly alluvium derived from rhyolitic tuffs and lavas on alluvial fans and drainageways. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Average temperature is about 50 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is about 13 inches.",
