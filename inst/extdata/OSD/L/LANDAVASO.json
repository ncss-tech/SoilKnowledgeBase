Newlin soils receive more than l5 inches annual precipitation and the SMCS is moist in some part, the majority of the time, during May and June.  Redridge soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the Bt horizon.  Tuthill soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the contrasting layers.  Wheatridge soils have less than 50 percent sand in the Bt and less than 35 percent fine sand or coarser. Wolfvar soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon."

Average annual precipitation is l2 to l5 inches, with the majority falling as rain between July and September as convective storms.  Average annual temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F., and frost-free period is l20 to l60 days."
