  "OVERVIEW": "The Lowland series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium from tuffaceous volcanic rocks or rhyolite.  These soils are on alluvial fans, mountains and hills. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
