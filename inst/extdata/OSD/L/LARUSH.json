These soils are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 53 to 55 degrees F.  The upper part of the particle-size control section is 7 to 15 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent throughout.  Reaction is strongly acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Some pedons lack organic stains.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.
