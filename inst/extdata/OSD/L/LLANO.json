  "OVERVIEW": "The Llano series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in gypsiferous lacustrine deposits. These nearly level soils are on relict lake beds. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 67 degrees F.",
