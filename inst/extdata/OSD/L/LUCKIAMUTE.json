  "OVERVIEW": "The Luckiamute series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from shale, sandstone, or siltstone. Luckiamute soils occur on summits, ridgetops, and shoulder slopes of mountains. Slopes are 3 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 135 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature is less than 47 degrees F with an O horizon present. The soil is usually moist but is dry for a short period of less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 to 12 inches in the four month period following the summer solstice in most years. Depth to a lithic contact and solum thickness ranges from 14 to 20 inches. The particle-size control section above the fractured bedrock has 18 to 35 percent clay and 50 to 80 percent total rock fragments, including both channer shaped fragments (shaly textural modifiers) and angular or subangular fragments (gravelly or cobbly textural modifiers). Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid. Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist, 3 or 4 dry. Texture is typically shaly medial loam with 12 to 30 percent clay content by field estimate, but ranges to medial loam where mapped over sandstone parent materials and has 25 to 70 percent total rock fragments. It has a moist bulk density less than 1.0 g/cm3, phosphate retention of 75 to 95 percent, and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. Texture is loam, clay loam or silty clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and has 50 to 80 percent total rock fragments. It has phosphate retention of 75 to 95 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, but lack moist bulk densities of less than 1.0 g/cm3 in this horizon."

Discovery soils have 7 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and border on a perudic moisture regime.

Whitecross soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and mean annual soil temperature of 32 to 38 degrees F.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon\nCambic horizon - from a depth of 3 to 16 inches (Bw1, Bw2 horizons).\nAndic feature - from the mineral soil surface to a depth of 3 inches (A horizon). Medial modifiers were used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not meeting andic soil properties. A proposal was submitted to NSSC (2000) to revise the definition of medial to also include those soil properties qualifying for the Andic subgroup under criteria #1 for andic soil properties.\nLithic feature - bedrock at a depth of 16 inches (R horizon).\nParticle-size control section - from a depth of 10 to 16 inches (Bw2 horizon).\nDepth to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nThe current lower limit of the elevation range for this series is 1800 feet which is considerably lower than that of the geographically associated soils (at 3000 feet). Upon further investigation and field observations in Polk County this range is likely to be revised to be consistent with all the associated soils."
