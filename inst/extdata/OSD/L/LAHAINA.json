  "OVERVIEW": "The Lahaina series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from basic igneous rock. Lahaina soils are on low elevation, mountain hillslopes and have slopes of 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual rainfall is about 762 millimeters (30 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C. (73 degrees F.)",
