  "STATES": "PB",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Laolao series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on volcanic uplands.  They formed in residuum from andesitic marine tuffs and tuffaceous sandstones. Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 90 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F.",
