  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lewis soils are on terraces, basin like areas, and valley plains.  Lewis soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. In some places the surface is fairly smooth while in others the surface has a hummocky microrelief.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  Elevations are 100 to 600 feet.  The climate is semiarid mesothermal having hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  Average January temperature is about 45 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 80 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 62 to 65 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 250 to 300 days."
