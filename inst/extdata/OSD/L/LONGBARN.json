The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.. Depth to lithic contact is 40 to 60 inches.  The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section is 40 to 50 percent.  The weighted average rock fragment content of the particle size control section is 5 to 25 percent.  The soil has a linear extensibility of 6.0 to 8.0 cm in the upper meter.  There is an absolute clay increase of 15 to 25 percent between the 2AB and 2Bt horizons.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 2 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 5 to 30 percent glass with acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron of 0.2 to 0.5.\nThe 2AB horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 2 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.

Golars soils are moderately deep and have an O horizon.  Hankins soils have an O horizon and a vitrandic feature in the surface horizons.  Jesh and Joenchris soils are very deep. Lacrol soils are very deep and moderately well drained.  Tippett soils have a vitrandic feature in the surface horizons and are formed in loess over clayey alluvium or lacustrine deposits. Warpaint soils are very deep and have a vitrandic feature in the surface horizons.   Zumwalt soils are moderately deep and have a vitrandic feature in the surface horizons."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Longbarn soils are on mountain slopes at elevations of 4,000 to 5,000 feet.  These soils formed in residuum from John Day Formation tuffaceous sediments and colluvium from welded tuff with an influence of volcanic ash.  The climate is characterized by cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, the mean annual temperature is 40 to 46 degrees F.,and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."
