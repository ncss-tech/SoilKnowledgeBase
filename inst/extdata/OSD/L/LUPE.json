The weighted average of calcium carbonate equivalent for the control section ranges from 15 to 40 percent.\nThe A horizon is dark gray (10YR 4/1), very dark gray (10YR 3/1), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), brown (10YR 5/3) or dark brown (10YR 4/3).  The A horizon is gravelly loam or gravelly sandy clay loam.  The volume of siliceous pebbles ranges from 15 to about 50 percent.\nThe B horizons are very pale brown (10YR 7/3, 8/3), pale brown (10YR 6/3), brown (10YR 5/3), light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) or yellowish brown (10YR 5/4).

Slope gradients range from 1 to 8 percent.  The soils formed in ancient stream terrace deposits of gravelly calcareous loamy sediments.  The climate is dry subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation is 26 to 38 inches.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices of 40 to 50, average annual soil temperature is 72 degrees to 74 degrees F."
