It is neutral to strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and value of 5 or 6. It is slightly acid to very strongly acid.  Some pedons have a BEg horizon.\nThe upper part of the Btg horizon has color value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, with distinct or prominent mottling.  This horizon is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  It ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid.  The lower part of the Btg horizon and BCg horizon, if present is similar to the upper part of the Btg horizon in color and texture, but ranges from neutral to strongly acid.\nThe C horizon is silty clay loam or silty clay, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Reaction is neutral to strongly acid."
