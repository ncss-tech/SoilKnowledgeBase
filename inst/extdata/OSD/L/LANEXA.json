  "OVERVIEW": "The Lanexa series consists of very deep, very poorly drained organic soils. They formed in herbaceous plant remains and fluvial sediments in fresh to slightly brackish water marshes along rivers and creeks of the Atlantic Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.   Mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the organic layers ranges from 16 to 51 inches.  The soil ranges from extremely acid through slightly acid in the natural state.  Upon drying, the reaction usually drops slightly.  The sulfur content ranges from 0.2 to 0.75 percent and usually decreases with depth.  The n- value of the mineral and organic materials in the control section ranges from 2 to 4.  The organic materials are mostly from herbaceous plants.  Thin lenses and strata of mineral soil materials are in the control section of most pedons.\nThe mineral and organic materials within the surface and subsurface tiers are neutral or have hue of 10YR through 5GY, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 0 through 2.  The organic material is dominantly sapric but some pedons have thin surface layers that are hemic.  The mineral materials are mucky analogues of silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.\nThe Cg horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR through 5GY, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 2.  Texture is variable and is commonly stratified, but the weighted average clay content in the particle size control section is greater than 35 percent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Kingile and Webile series.  The Kingile and Webile soils have rapid permeability in the organic materials and, in addition, have a mean annual precipitation of 16 inches, and a lower salinity content in the surface layers.  Similar soils in related families include the Axis, Backbay, Bohicket, Dorovan, Levy, Mattan, Pocaty, and Rappahannock series.  Axis, Backbay, Bohicket, and Levy are mineral soils.  Dorovan soils have organic materials thicker than 51 inches.  Mattan soils are underlain by loamy sediments and formed in both herbaceous and woody plant remains. Pocaty and Rappahannock soils have more than 0.75 percent sulfur in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lanexa soils are on fresh to slightly brackish water tidal marshes along rivers and creeks of the Atlantic Coastal Plain.  They are regularly flooded by tides and occasionally by wind tides.  Salt content is generally higher in the flood waters during prolonged dry summer and early fall months of most years.  The soils formed mostly in herbaceous plant remains and stratified fluvial sediments.  The climate is humid temperate with mean annual precipitation of about 45 inches and mean annual temperature of about 58 degrees F near the type location."

Except for Mattan, all of these are mineral soils.  In addition, the Nawney soils are on drainageways at slightly higher elevations."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained; moderate permeability in the organic layers and very slow permeability in the underlying mineral layers.  Fluctuating tides inundate the surface daily.  The water table fluctuates from 6 inches below the surface to 24 inches above the surface most of the time. Wind tides and storm tides cause inundation up to 36 inches."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Lanexa soils are used mainly as wetland wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation consists mostly of annual herbaceous plants. These include Arrow-arum, arrowhead, American waterlily, cattail, pickerelweed, and smartweeds.  Woody vegetation includes scattered bald cypress, water tupelo, buttonbush, and groundsel-tree."
