  "OVERVIEW": "The Larton series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in material weathered from loamy and sandy alluvium, and on eolian materials of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level to strongly sloping soils are on broad smooth high terraces of the Western Coastal Plains (MLRA 133B) and Arkansas Valley and Ridges (MLRA 118).  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 64 degrees F.",

The A horizon or E horizon is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 6 to 8.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam (l5 to 25 percent clay) and is moderately acid to very strongly acid.  Some pedons lack pockets of clean sand grains in the lower part.  The Bt4 horizon is similar to the upper Bt horizon in color but ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid and contains pockets of clean sand grains comprising 2 to l0 percent by volume.\nSome pedons have BC horizons with colors and textures similar to the Bt horizon."
