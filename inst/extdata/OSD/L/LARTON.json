The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The A horizon or E horizon is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 6 to 8.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam (l5 to 25 percent clay) and is moderately acid to very strongly acid.  Some pedons lack pockets of clean sand grains in the lower part.  The Bt4 horizon is similar to the upper Bt horizon in color but ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid and contains pockets of clean sand grains comprising 2 to l0 percent by volume.\nSome pedons have BC horizons with colors and textures similar to the Bt horizon."

Karma soils are on lower terraces and have an argillic horizon that decreases by more than 20 percent clay from the maximum within a depth of 60 inches. Okay soils are on terraces of similar elevations and have a mollic epipedon."
