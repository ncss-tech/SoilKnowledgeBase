  "OVERVIEW": "The Lieber series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loess and in the underlying paleosol in till. Lieber soils are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12.2 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
