In undrained areas, depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between November and May in normal years. In drained areas, depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2 feet) between December and April in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part of the solum and moderately low in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow in the lower part."
