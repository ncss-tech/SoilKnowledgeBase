  "OVERVIEW": "The Letha series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on low terraces.  They formed in alluvium from acid igneous rocks. Permeability is moderate.  Slopes are 0 to about 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 250 millimeters, and the average annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
