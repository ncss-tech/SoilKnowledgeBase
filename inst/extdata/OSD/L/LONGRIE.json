Slope gradients are dominantly 0 to 6 percent but range from 0 to 35 percent. They formed in 50 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loamy till overlying limestone, dolomite, or dolomitic limestone bedrock. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 838 mm (27 to 33 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.0 to 7.2 degrees C (41 to 45 degrees F)."

The somewhat poorly drained Sundell soils are on slightly lower landscape positions. The poorly drained Nahma soils are in depressions and drainageways. The Sundell and Nahma soils form a drainage sequence with Longrie soils. Associated loamy soils less than 50 cm (20 inches) deep to bedrock are the well drained Amadon soils on similar landscape positions, and the somewhat poorly drained Ensign and poorly drained Ruse soils on lower landscape positions. The Greylock, Omena, Onaway, and Trenary soils are very deep, well drained, loamy soils on similar landscape positions."

Those areas in cropland are used for oats, wheat, corn, hay crops, and pasture. Cherry and apple orchards are on this soil in the Door Peninsula of Wisconsin."
