  "STATES": "MI,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Longrie series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in loamy glacial deposits underlain by limestone bedrock at a depth of 50 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) on ground moraines, glacial lake benches, and terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 4.4 degrees C (40 degrees F).",

The somewhat poorly drained Sundell soils are on slightly lower landscape positions. The poorly drained Nahma soils are in depressions and drainageways. The Sundell and Nahma soils form a drainage sequence with Longrie soils. Associated loamy soils less than 50 cm (20 inches) deep to bedrock are the well drained Amadon soils on similar landscape positions, and the somewhat poorly drained Ensign and poorly drained Ruse soils on lower landscape positions. The Greylock, Omena, Onaway, and Trenary soils are very deep, well drained, loamy soils on similar landscape positions."
