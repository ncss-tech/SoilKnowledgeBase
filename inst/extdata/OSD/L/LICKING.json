    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum ranges in thickness from 30 to 70 inches. Thickness of the silt mantle ranges from 12 to 30 inches. If present, carbonates are at a depth of more than 60 inches. Some pedons have up to 2 percent coarse fragments in the upper part of the solum. The particle-size control section has an average of 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is moderately acid to very strongly acid. Undisturbed pedons have an A horizon 1 to 4 inches thick that has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.\nIn most cultivated pedons, the E horizon is mixed in the Ap horizon. Undisturbed pedons have an E horizon 3 to 8 inches thick that has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silt loam and is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 to 8. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silty clay or clay with clay content ranging from 40 to 60 percent. Some stratification or lamination is evident and thin strata of silty clay loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam are in some pedons. The 2Bt horizon is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay and includes thin strata silt loam, or fine sand. It is moderately acid to mildly alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Banister, Branchville, Cardinal, Celina, Eudy, Hartville, Jerktail, Loudon, Tarlton and Whippany series. Banister and Cardinal soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity within the solum. Branchville and Loudon soils have more rock fragments and the lower part of the solum formed in residuum from bedrock.  Celina soils have carbonates within 36 inches. Eudy, Jerktail and Tarlton soils have bedrock within 80 inches. Hartville soils are more acid in the lower part of the solum. Whippany soils do not have 2B and 2C horizons with a sharp increase in clay content at a depth of 12 to 30 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Licking soils occur on terraces. Slope gradients range from 0 to 25 percent. The soils formed in clayey lacustrine sediments and in a silty mantle 12 to 30 inches thick. They are believed to be primarily of local origin with glacial meltwater probably contributing sediments in some areas. The present terraces are above flood plain level and are adjacent to strongly sloping to steep valley walls. The mean annual precipitation varies from 35 to 44 inches, and the mean annual temperature varies from 49 to 58 degrees F."

The fine-loamy Chagrin and Holly soils, the fine-silty Nolin soils and the coarse-loamy Pope soils are on alluvial flood plains. The Gilpin, Keene, Latham and Zanesville soils are on the upland hills and formed dominantly in residuum from bedrock. The somewhat poorly drained McGary soils are on flats and depressions on the same terraces. The fine silty Otwell and Gallipolis soils are on similar positions on the same terraces."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Series revisions in 2007 are based on extensive field studies in Ohio of soils mapped Licking and Wyatt.  The study resulted in recorrelation of map units in 9 counties and moving the Licking Type Location to a more central location in the area of distribution. Additional laboratory data indicate an active CEC activity class rather than semiactive (series was reclassified).\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of about 11 inches (Ap and BE horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 11 to 48 inches (Bt1, 2Bt2 and 2Bt3 horizons).\nLithologic discontinuity at a depth of 19 inches (top of 2Bt2 horizon).\nRevised: 07/2003-LAT; 07/2007-RJG, NHM, DHK\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
