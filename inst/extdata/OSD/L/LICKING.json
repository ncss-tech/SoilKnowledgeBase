  "OVERVIEW": "The Licking series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in a mantle of silty material over clayey lacustrine sediments. Permeability is moderately slow in the upper part of the solum and slow in the lower part. These soils are on terraces and have slopes ranging from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches, and mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.",

Banister and Cardinal soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity within the solum. Branchville and Loudon soils have more rock fragments and the lower part of the solum formed in residuum from bedrock.  Celina soils have carbonates within 36 inches. Eudy, Jerktail and Tarlton soils have bedrock within 80 inches. Hartville soils are more acid in the lower part of the solum. Whippany soils do not have 2B and 2C horizons with a sharp increase in clay content at a depth of 12 to 30 inches."

The soils formed in clayey lacustrine sediments and in a silty mantle 12 to 30 inches thick. They are believed to be primarily of local origin with glacial meltwater probably contributing sediments in some areas. The present terraces are above flood plain level and are adjacent to strongly sloping to steep valley walls. The mean annual precipitation varies from 35 to 44 inches, and the mean annual temperature varies from 49 to 58 degrees F."

The fine-loamy Chagrin and Holly soils, the fine-silty Nolin soils and the coarse-loamy Pope soils are on alluvial flood plains. The Gilpin, Keene, Latham and Zanesville soils are on the upland hills and formed dominantly in residuum from bedrock. The somewhat poorly drained McGary soils are on flats and depressions on the same terraces. The fine silty Otwell and Gallipolis soils are on similar positions on the same terraces."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Series revisions in 2007 are based on extensive field studies in Ohio of soils mapped Licking and Wyatt.  The study resulted in recorrelation of map units in 9 counties and moving the Licking Type Location to a more central location in the area of distribution. Additional laboratory data indicate an active CEC activity class rather than semiactive (series was reclassified).\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of about 11 inches (Ap and BE horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 11 to 48 inches (Bt1, 2Bt2 and 2Bt3 horizons).\nLithologic discontinuity at a depth of 19 inches (top of 2Bt2 horizon).\nRevised: 07/2003-LAT; 07/2007-RJG, NHM, DHK\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
