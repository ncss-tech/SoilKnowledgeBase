  "OVERVIEW": "The Lark series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in sandy gypsiferous eolian deposits. These rolling soils are on sand sheets, lunette playa dunes, vegetated dunes on dune fields, playa steps, and playas.  Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
