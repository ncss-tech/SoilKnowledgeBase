  "OVERVIEW": "The Louris series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained calcareous soils that formed in a silty mantle of glacial lacustrine sediments or loess over loamy glacial till on glacial lake plains and moraines.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 24 inches, and mean annual air temperature is 46 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 16 inches.  The thickness of the silty mantle and depth to glacial till ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  The upper sediment typically does not have rock fragments, but in some pedons it contains up to 2 percent by volume.  The glacial till contains 2 to 10 percent, by volume, of coarse fragments of mixed lithology. The calcic horizon is within depths of 40 inches and has 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  The profile is calcareous throughout and the reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The control section has 18 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A, Ap and Ak horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  They are typically silt loam but the range includes silty clay loam.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3, or a hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It does not have distinct or prominent mottles.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.   Carbonates are typically disseminated throughout the matrix but some pedons have a few threads or masses of segregated carbonates.\nThe C and 2C horizons have hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Fe depletions are typically present.  The C horizon is silt loam or loam.  The 2C horizon is loam or clay loam."
