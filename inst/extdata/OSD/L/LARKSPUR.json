  "OVERVIEW": "The Larkspur series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and/or residuum over rhyolite and other moderately fine-grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on mountains, hills and ridges of structural benches.  Slopes are 4 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 381 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
