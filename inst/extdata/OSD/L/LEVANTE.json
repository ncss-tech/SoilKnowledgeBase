  "OVERVIEW": "The Levante series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, schist, and granitic sandstone.  Levante soils are on flood plains of valley floors.  Slopes are 1 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
