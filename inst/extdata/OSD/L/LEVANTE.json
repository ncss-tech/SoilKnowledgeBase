They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist and Tertiary granitic sandstone.  Slopes are 1 to 4 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,500 to 7,300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.   The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

Buckhorse soils are coarse-loamy, have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons, and occur on toeslopes of erosional fan remnants.  Dondiego soils are fine-loamy, have thick mollic epipedons, and occur on treads of high stream terraces and also on low stream terraces of valley floors."
