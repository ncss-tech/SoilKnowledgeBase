  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of solum and depth to free carbonates is 30 to 60 inches or more.  The loess mantle is 5 to 15 inches in thickness.  Dolomite bedrock occurs at depths of 40 to 100 inches or more.  The average content of clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon ranges from 35 to 55 percent.  The loess mantle has less than 5 percent rock fragments.  The 2B horizon has 10 to 35 percent rock fragments and the 3B and 3C horizons have 35 to 70 percent rock fragments.  The fragments in the loess and 2B horizon are both chert and dolomite.  The fragments in the 3B and 3C horizons are cobbles and gravels of dolomite.\nThe A or Ap horizon has chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon has  value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A and E horizons are neutral or slightly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon typically has hue of 5YR and less commonly 7.5YR.  It has value and chroma of 4 through 6.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay or clay loam with 35 to 75 percent clay in the fine earth fraction.  It is neutral to strongly acid.  Some pedons have a thin Bt horizon formed in the upper mantle.\nThe 3Bt horizon typically has hue of 7.5YR and less commonly 10YR.  It has value of 4 or 5.  It is loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction.  It is moderately acid through neutral.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It is loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lamoille soils have plane or convex slopes on back slopes and shoulders in dissected uplands.  Slope gradients are 2 to 50 percent and lengths are 200 to 500 feet.  Local relief ranges from 300 to 600 feet.  The regolith consists of 5 to 15 inches of loess over 10 to 30 inches of clayey residuum overlying loamy-skeletal colluvium derived from dolomite.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 35 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Blackhammer, Dorerton, Lacrescent, Nodine, Newhouse, Rollingstone, Seaton, Southridge, and Valton soils.  Blackhammer, Nodine, Newhouse, Rollingstone, Southridge, and Valton soils are upslope with lesser gradient and contain less rock fragments.  Dorerton soils are on positions similar to Lamoille soils, but they have loamy-skeletal argillic horizons.  Lacrescent soils have a mollic epipedon have steeper slopes and typically are downslope.  Seaton soils are upslope and formed in thick loess."
