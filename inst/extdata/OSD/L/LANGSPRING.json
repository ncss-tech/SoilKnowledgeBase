  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 48 degrees F.  Solum thickness ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  Depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 8 to 30 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent and are commonly less in the upper horizons which contain a component of loess.  Rock fragments are dominantly 1/4 to 6 inches in diameter.  The calcic horizon contains 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, and loam.  This horizon is commonly calcareous, but is noncalcareous in some pedons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy clay loam and loam.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 7 or 8, 6 or 7 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Some pedons may have accumulations of gypsum below 30 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Langspring soils are on mesas, fan aprons, terraces, and plateaus that have convex or plane surfaces.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in residuum and slope alluvium derived from fine grained sandstone and shale with a component of loess in the upper 2 to 4 feet.  Elevation at the type location is 6,000 to 7,300 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 7 to 11 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 75 to 105 days."
