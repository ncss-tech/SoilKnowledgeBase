    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  There is less than 15 percent material coarser than very fine sand including 0 to 5 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section. The control section is 18 to 27 percent clay. The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 51 degrees to 53 degrees F. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR through 5GY, value of 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2. This horizon is mostly stratified heavy silt loam, very fine sandy loam and silty clay loam but thin layers of loam or fine sandy loam are in some pedons. It has angular blocky, subangular blocky or prismatic structure. It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5BG, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 or 2. It is mostly stratified silt loam, heavy silt loam and very fine sandy loam, but has thin strata as coarse as loamy sand or as fine as silty clay loam. The coarser material is a t a depth greater than 40 inches. It is slightly acid or neutral."

Beaucoup, Blackoar, and Gorham soils have cooler winter soil temperatures and warmer summer soil temperatures.  Also, Beaucoup soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the control section and Blackoar soils have more than 0.5 percent organic matter at a depth of 50 inches. Bridgeson soils have 27 to 32 percent clay in the control section. Sauvie and Wapato soils have mean annual soil temperature of 53 to 55 degrees F. and have 27 to 35 percent clay in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lummi soils are on flood plains near estuaries and tidal salt marshes at elevations of near sea level to 50 feet. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. They formed in marine sediments and alluvium. The soils are in a mild marine climate and have cool, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 50 inches. Average January temperature is about 38 degrees F., average July temperature is about 60 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F. Frost-free season is 170 to 200 days."
