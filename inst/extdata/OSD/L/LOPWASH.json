  "OVERVIEW": "The Lopwash series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks and loess.  Lopwash soils are on inset fans and fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
