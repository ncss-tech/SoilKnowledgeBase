    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to paralithic bedrock is 4 to 20 inches, (10 to 51 cm).  The mean annual soil temperature is 60 to 68 degrees F, (16 to 20 degrees C).  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay, and 2 to 35 percent rock fragments, mostly gravel.  Mineralogy is mixed.  A fluctuating water table can occur between the top of the bedrock and 2 inches, (5 cm) below the surface of the soil on gentler slopes from December through March.  Redoximorphic features such as oxidized iron masses and iron-manganese concretions occur in the A horizon, and manganese accumulations on top of the paralithic contact.  Rock fragments on the surface range from 0 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles, 0 to 5 percent stones and 0 to 2 percent boulders.\nThe A horizon dry color is 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7.5YR 5/3, 6/3 or 7/3.  Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 7.5YR 4/2 or 4/3.  Texture is loam, gravelly loam, sandy clay loam or gravelly sandy clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 22 to 35 percent.  Rock fragments range from 2 to 35 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon dry color is 7.5YR 5/3, 6/3, 6/4, 7/4, 10YR 6/3 or 7/3.
