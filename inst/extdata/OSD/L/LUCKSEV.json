  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lucksev series consists of shallow and very shallow, moderately well drained soils that formed in residuum, colluvium and alluvium from volcanic rocks.  Lucksev soils are on ridge tops, side slopes and strath terraces on Cascade foothills.  Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches, (686 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F, (16 degrees C).",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to paralithic bedrock is 4 to 20 inches, (10 to 51 cm).  The mean annual soil temperature is 60 to 68 degrees F, (16 to 20 degrees C).  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay, and 2 to 35 percent rock fragments, mostly gravel.  Mineralogy is mixed.  A fluctuating water table can occur between the top of the bedrock and 2 inches, (5 cm) below the surface of the soil on gentler slopes from December through March.  Redoximorphic features such as oxidized iron masses and iron-manganese concretions occur in the A horizon, and manganese accumulations on top of the paralithic contact.  Rock fragments on the surface range from 0 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles, 0 to 5 percent stones and 0 to 2 percent boulders.\nThe A horizon dry color is 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7.5YR 5/3, 6/3 or 7/3.  Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 7.5YR 4/2 or 4/3.  Texture is loam, gravelly loam, sandy clay loam or gravelly sandy clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 22 to 35 percent.  Rock fragments range from 2 to 35 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon dry color is 7.5YR 5/3, 6/3, 6/4, 7/4, 10YR 6/3 or 7/3.
