  "OVERVIEW": "The Leoni series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in gravelly and cobbly loamy materials and gravelly and cobbly sandy materials on outwash plains, eskers, kames, valley trains, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
