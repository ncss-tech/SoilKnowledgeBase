    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  Soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 to 12 inches for 50 to 90 days in the summer.  The solum and mollic epipedon range from 20 to 56 inches thick.  The 10 to 40-inch control section averages 20 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  The A and upper part of the B horizon are slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  The lower part of the B horizon and the C horizon are neutral to mildly alkaline.  Some pedons lack a B horizon.\nThe A horizon and upper part of the Bt horizon have value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 moist, and chroma of 0 through 2 dry and moist.  The A horizon is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe 2B horizon has hue of neutral, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 0 through 3 dry and moist.  It is clay loam, loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4 moist, 3 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is sandy clay loam, silt loam, or loam. Some pedons have a few scattered mycelial lime veins below 30 inches."

Blackrock soils have 20 to 35 percent rock fragments in the 10 to 40-inch control section and have Bk horizons at depths of 23 to 46 inches.  Coit soils are mottled and calcareous throughout the control section.  Dagor soils are medium textured, well drained, noncalcareous throughout and lack a water table to depths of 60 inches.  Eastcan soils are calcareous throughout and have mottles below depth of 25 to 40 inches.  Goose Creek soils are mottled at depths of less than 35 inches.  Monroe soils have a loam or fine sandy loam texture control section and are usually dry.  Soquel soils have mean annual soil temperature of about 57 degrees F.  Willowdale soils are usually dry, well drained and are calcareous at depths below 20 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lakeview soils are on flood plains and   alluvial fans at elevations of 4,050 to 5,500 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium weathered from tuff, andesite, rhyolite, and basalt and mixed with small amounts of ash.  The climate is characterized by hot dry summers and cool wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 18 inches.  The mean January temperature is 27 to 29 degrees F., the mean July temperature is 65 to 69 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 110 days."

Goose Lake soils are poorly drained and have an albic horizon that grades abruptly to a clayey Bt horizon.  Malin soils are sodic and average 35 to 50 percent clay.  Ozamis soils are poorly drained and have a mollic epipedon 10 to 15 inches thick.  Stockdrive soils are sodic and have a natric horizon."
