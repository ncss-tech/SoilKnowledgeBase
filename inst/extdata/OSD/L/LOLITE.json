  "OVERVIEW": "The Lolite series consists of well drained, slowly permeable soils that are shallow to noncalcareous sodic shale on ridges and hillsides.  They formed in residuum.  Slopes range from 3 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 6 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section is clay, silty clay, or clay loam with 35 to 55 percent clay and less than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  Hue is 2.5Y or 5Y, value is 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma is 1 through 3.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon typically is noncalcareous, however, in some pedons it is calcareous from dust and overflow.  ESP is less than 15.  Salinity is less than 4 mmhos.  A vesicular crust is on some pedons.\nThe By horizon has less than 5 percent gypsum.  ESP is less than 15.  Salinity is less than 4 mmhos.  Some pedons do not have a By horizon.\nThe C horizon has platy shale rock structure, however, roots can penetrate the platy fragments.  Salt crystals, dominantly sodium sulfate, are inherited from the parent material with only slight alteration.  ESP is commonly greater than 20 and ranges from 15 to 60.  Salinity is commonly greater than 10 mmhos and ranges from 8 to 20 mmhos.\nThe Cr is soft, platy, noncalcareous, sodic shale.  It is frequently more than 20 feet thick."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in residuum derived from sodic, noncalcareous shale.  These soils are often intermixed with rock outcrop and gullied land.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 42 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 130 days.  Elevation is 4,900 to 6,500 feet."
