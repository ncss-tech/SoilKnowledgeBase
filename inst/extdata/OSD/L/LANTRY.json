  "OVERVIEW": "The Lantry series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in loamy residuum weathered from soft sedimentary bedrock on uplands.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent slopes.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to bedrock is typically 26 to 40 inches, but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation ranges from 6 to 10 inches.  The control section is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam averaging between 18 and 27 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.  Typically, the soil contains free carbonates to the surface, but the A horizon is leached in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is typically silt loam, but some pedons are loam and very fine sandy loam.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or 10YR; value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist; and chroma of 2 or 4.  It is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam  and is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or 10YR; value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam and is slightly or moderately alkaline.  It has few to many accumulations of carbonate.  Some pedons have a C horizon which has colors and texture of the Bk horizon.\nThe Cr horizon is soft siltstone, sandstone, or loamy shales."
