  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solumn thickness ranges from 25 to 60 inches or more. Depth to bedrock is greater than 6 feet. Fragments of gravel range from about 5 to 25 percent in the A and Bw horizons, 10 to 30 percent in Bg horizon, and 35 to 90 percent in the Cg horizon. Commonly this soil has less than 15 percent gravel in the surface layer and upper part of the subsoil. The very gravelly or extremely gravelly horizons begin at a depth of about 30 to 40 inches. The fragments are dominantly rounded and subrounded fragments of chert.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid, except where lime has been added.\nThe A and Ap horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam, or rarely sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Few to common redoximorphic features as iron depletions of chroma 2 or less are present within 24 inches of the soil surface. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. Redoximorphic features in shades of brown and red range from few to many. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, or clay loam.\nThe C or Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. Many pedons have common to many redoximorphic features as iron concentrations and/or low chroma iron depletions. Texture of the fine earth texture is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy loam."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The only soil in the same family is the Mooreville series.. Similar soils are the Chewacla, Ennis, Lee, Lindell, and Oakboro series in related families. Mooreville soils contain few or no rock fragments.  Chewacla and Oakboro soils have mixed mineralogy and contain mica. Ennis soils do not have iron depletions of chroma 2 or less within 24 inches of the surface. Lee soils have chroma 2 or less within 10 inches of the surface. Lindell soils have a higher base saturation and has less gravel below 30 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lobelville soils are on flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The soil formed in loamy alluvium containing varying amounts of gravel. Near the type location the average annual temperature is 57.7 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is 52.8 inches."
