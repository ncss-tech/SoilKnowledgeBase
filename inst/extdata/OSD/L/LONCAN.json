  "OVERVIEW": "The Loncan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived mainly from chert or sedimentary and volcanic rocks.  Loncan soils are on hills and mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 5 degrees C.",
