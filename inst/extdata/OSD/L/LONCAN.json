  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Loncan soils are on north and east aspects of hill and mountain side slopes in pockets and draws and in colluvial positions on lower slopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from chert, welded tuffs, shale, conglomerate, andesite, sandstone, rhyolite and other volcanic or sedimentary rocks. Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,680 to 2,445 meters.   The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation, mostly snow, is 300 to 400 mm; mean annual air temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
