  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lapon series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from basic igneous rocks with a component of ashy loess.  These soils are on plateaus, hill and mountain terraces and upper side slopes.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C and the mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm.",
