  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Keltys series in the same family. The Alazan, Besner, Colita, Gomery Hicota, Kurth, Moten, and Penning series are in closely related families. Keltys soils have a Cr horizon at 40 to 60 inches deep and formed in sediments associated with the Cadell, Manning or Yegua Formations.  Besner and Hicota soils have a solum thicker than 80 inches and do not have saturated layers within a depth of 40 inches. In addition Hicota soils have an argillic horizon with hue redder than 10YR. Alazan, Kurth, and Penning soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section. In addition, Alazan and Penning soils have aquic conditions in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon. Moten soils have a solum thicker than 60 inches. Colita soils have a thinner surface layer, have  more than 18 percent clay in the Bt horizon, and have a Cr horizon at 40 to 60 inches deep. Gomery soils have a sandy epipedon 20 to 40 inches thick, contain more clay in the Bt horizon, and have base saturation less than 35 percent. Moten soils contain more low chroma colors due to wetness, and contain more clay in the lower 2B horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. They formed in loamy and sandy sediments associated with the Catahoula geologic formation. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 55 inches. Frost-free rainfall is about 30 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F. and the Thornthwaite annual P-E indices exceed 70."

Permeability is moderate. The soil is saturated in the layers below 2.5 to 3.5 feet deep, and above the 2C horizon for more than 30 cumulative days during the winter and spring months in normal years."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Laska series was assigned to a semiactive activity class in 2000. The classification of the Laska series was changed from an Aquic Hapludalf to an Oxyaquic Glossudalf in 2001 based on field observations and piezometer data collected in Trinity County, Texas, and observations near the former type location in Polk County, Texas.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the current type location pedon include:\nOchric epipedon.................0 to 24 inches (A and E horizons)\nAlbic horizon.....................6 to 14 inches (E1 horizon)\nGlossic horizon.................24 to 41 inches (Bt/E1 horizon)\nArgillic horizon................24 to 63 inches (Bt/E horizons)\nLithologic Discontinuity......63 inches (top of 2Cr horizon)\nParalithic contact..............63 inches (top of 2Cr horizon)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
