  "OVERVIEW": "The Leevan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks or volcanoclastic sedimentary rocks.  Leevan soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Leevan soils are on mountains and hills.  They typically occur on convex shoulder, backslope, or footslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks (welded tuff, rhyolite, and basalt) or volcanoclastic sedimentary rocks (sandstone, shale, and conglomerate).  Elevations range from 1,710 to 2,535 meters and are 1,740 to 1,925 meters near the Nevada-Idaho state line.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 410 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
