    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lostpepper soils are on outwash terraces. They typically occur on summit positions.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,650 to 1,750 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 to 560 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."
