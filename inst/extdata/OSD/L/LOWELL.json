    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lowell soils are on upland ridgetops and sideslopes or footslopes and benches.  Slopes range from 2 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in residuum, mantled with up to 18 inches of loess in some areas, or slope creep from soils formed in residuum from limestone or interbedded limestone, shale, and siltstone.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F."
