  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 6 inches.  The upper part of the control section is calcareous, but the soils grade to noncalcareous horizons at depths of less than 40 inches.  Conductivity ranges from 0 to 14 millimhos in a major part of the control section.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent in most of the control section, and there is no subhorizon more than 4 inches thick above depth of 20 inches that exceeds 15 percent.  Depth to skeletal materials ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  The upper part of the control section, ranging in thickness from 10 to 20 inches, is loam or clay loam with clay averaging 18 to 35 percent.  This grades to stratified sandy loam and loam at depths shallow enough so that on a weighted average basis the soil is coarse-loamy with clay averaging 5 to 18 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the particle-size control section.  Hue ranges from 5Y through 7.5YR, with mottles to 2.5Y, and gley hues of N and 5Y.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is usually distinctly mottled in at least its lower part.  This horizon is neutral through strongly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has value of 5 through 7, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 0 through 4.  This horizon is neutral through strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  LaJara soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans.   Slopes range from 0 to about 6 percent.  The soils formed in alluvial materials derived principally from basalt.  The average annual precipitation is 7 to 16 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the late summer.  These soils are poorly drained and have fluctuating water tables that stand at or near the surface during part of almost every season.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 52 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Alamosa, Gold Creek, LaSauses and Vastine soils.  Alamosa soils have argillic horizons with more than 18 percent clay.  LaSauses soils lack mollic epipedons and have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium in their upper horizons.  Gold creek soils have wide cracks when dry, and >35% clay in the particle-size control section.  Vastine soils have more than 18%, but less than 35% clay in the particle-size control section; and, a strongly contrasting substratum."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally as native pastureland or for hay meadows.  In some areas where they have been drained, they are used for small grains, but crops requiring cultivation in the summer are not generally grown.  Native vegetation is mainly sedges, rushes, wild iris, and other water-tolerant plants."
