  "OVERVIEW": "The Lehew series consists of moderately deep, well drained to excessively drained soils formed in material weathered from reddish sandstone, siltstone, and shale. They are nearly level to very steep soils on uplands. Slopes range from 0 to 80 percent. Permeability is moderately rapid to rapid.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 30 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 80 percent rock fragments and 5 to 18 percent clay. Rock fragments consist of sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Rock fragments range from 0 to 40 percent in A, Ap, and E horizons and include channers, cobbles, flagstones, and stones; 20 to 40 percent in individual subhorizons of the Bw horizon; and 35 to 90 percent in the C horizon. Base saturation is less than 60 percent between a depth of 10 to 30 inches. The unlimed soil is extremely acid or strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. Some pedons have an Ap horizon that has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is weak very fine granular or weak fine and medium granular. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam. It has weak fine or medium granular structure and very friable or friable consistence.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction with a weighted average clay content of 5 to 18 percent. Structure is weak or moderate very fine to medium subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction. Consistence is loose to firm."

Marbleyard soils have hues of 7.5YR and yellower in the Bw horizon and have rock fragment lithologies of quartzite and metasandstone.  Varilla soils are more than 60 inches deep to bedrock and have hues of 7.5YR or yellower in the Bw horizon.\nThe Dekalb, Hazleton, Sherando, and Wallen series are in closely related families.   Dekalb and Wallen soils have hues of 7.5YR or yellower Bw horizon.  Hazleton and Sherando soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock and have yellower hues in the Bw horizon.\nThe Berks, Calvin, Dekalb, and Hazleton soils are similar soils in related families. The Berks, Calvin, Dekalb, and Hazleton soils have mixed mineralogy."
