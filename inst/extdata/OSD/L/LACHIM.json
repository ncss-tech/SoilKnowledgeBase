Goldrun and Incy soils are aeolian in origin, contain more fine sand, and are very deep.  Hotsprings soils are more than 40 inches deep. Quiton soils are formed in basalt and contain more fine sand.  Toll soils are alluvial in origin and are very deep.  Zorravista soils are very deep, on dunes and contain volcanic ash and more fine sand."
