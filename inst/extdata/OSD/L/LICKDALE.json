  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum and depth to sandy layer ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is 3-1/2 to 6 feet. Fragments of sandstone, weathered but not waterworn, range from 0 to 20 percent in the solum and may be higher than 20 percent in the C horizon. Shale fragments may be present in some pedons.\nThe A1 or Ap horizon is black, very dark gray or very dark grayish brown. The A1 horizon contains 10 percent or more organic matter. The B horizon matrix has hues of 10YR to 5Y or neutral, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 0 through 2. Mottles have hues of 10YR to 5YR, values of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 8. Textures are dominantly loam or silt loam, but silty clay loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam are included. The C horizon has about the same color range as the B horizon and is coarser in texture."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Vester series is the only known member of the same family. Other competing series include the Elkins and Sekiu soils. Insufficient information is available to differentiate the Vester soils. Elkins soils have textures with less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand between depths of 10 to 40 inches. Sekiu soils have more than 60 percent clay and kaolintic mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lickdale soils occupy upland flats and slight depressions. Slopes range up to about 5 percent. The regolith is residuum from acid sandstones and shales, with some local alluvium in places. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 57 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation franges from 35 to 50 inches."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1) Umbric epipedon-the zone from 0 to 10 inches (Ap horizon).\n2) Cambic horizon-zone from 10 to 32 inches (B horizons)\n3) Strongly contrasting particle-size classes at 32 inches.\n4) Lithic contact at 46 inches.\nThe 12/2005 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). The CEC activity class placement is based on similar soils and not on laboratory data. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available.\nCompeting series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nPrevious revision dates: 11/95\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
