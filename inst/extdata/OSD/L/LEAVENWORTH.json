  "OVERVIEW": "The Leavenworth series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from granite.  The Leavenworth soils are on bottomlands.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches.",

Coxlake soils are dry for less than 60 consecutive days.  Deerspring, Okanogan, and Poween soils are dry for more than 75 consecutive days.  Endersby soils are dry more than 90 consecutive days and are well drained.  Evans soils are slightly acid in the control section and lack loamy fine sand strata in the control section.  Flofeather soils have an aridic bordering on xeric soil moisture regime.  Lapwai soils have secondary accumulations of calcium carbonate at 30 to 40 inches and have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Narcisse soils have redox features within 30 inches of the surface and lack loamy fine sand strata in the control section.  Patit Creek soils have more than 50 percent coarse fragments in the lower part of the control section.  Pleasant View soils have 12 to 25 percent calcium carbonate accumulation below the mollic epipedon.  Plinco soils are dry for about 105 consecutive days and have 15 to 20 percent gravel in the particle-size control section. Porter soils have an aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.  Redola soils are calcareous throughout the particle-size control section.  Threecreeks soils have 15 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have sandy substratum textures at depths of 35 to 45 inches.  Tombeall soils have redox concentrations at depths of 12 to 30 inches."

The soils formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, schist, and micaceous sandstone. Elevations are 1,100 to 1,500 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 25 inches.  The mean January temperature is 24 to 27 degrees F, the mean July temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F.
