  "OVERVIEW": "The Lonely series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium overlying igneous bedrock.  Lonely soils are on dissected rock pediments and mountain sideslopes and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The soil temperature is above 41 degrees from mid-April through mid-November.  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments in the particle-size control section range from 5 to 35 percent and are primarily gravel.  Clay content in the particle-size control section ranges from 27 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and 3 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 to 6 dry and 3 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 3 dry or moist.  It is clay loam or gravelly clay loam.  It has 5 to 35 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline."
