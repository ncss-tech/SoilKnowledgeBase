    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 33 to 53 inches.  The soil ranges from strongly through extremely acid.  Organic matter content is 1.5 percent or more in the upper 6 inches of the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon has colors in hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 4 and chromas of 2 to 4.  It is dominantly clay or silty clay loam.\nThe upper part of the Bo horizon has dominant colors in hues of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, values of 4 to 6 and chromas of 4 to 8.  The lower part of the Bo horizon includes hue of 2.5YR.  Texture is dominantly clay and the structure ranges from moderate medium to coarse subangular blocky.  Clay films range from few faint to many prominent.\nThe C horizon consists of very highly weathered saprolite with variegated colors, friable and with common to many sand sized quartz grains."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aceitunas, Aibonito, Alonso, Cialitos, Daguao, Daguey, Humatas, Ingenio, Jagueyes, Lares, Los Guineos, Magens, Naranjito, Sabana Seca, and Torres series.  The Aceitunas and Torres soils have thicker argillic horizons.  The Aibonito and Daguey soils have mixed mineralogy.  The Alonso, Ingenio, and Jagueyes soils have lower organic matter values in the upper argillic horizon--less than 1.5 percent.  In addition, the Alonso and Ingenio soils have redder colors in the Bt horizon and the Jaguey lacks the dark brown upper B horizon and is sandier.  The Cialitos soils have oxidic mineralogy. The Daguao, Humatas, Los Guineos, and Naranjito soils have higher exchange capacity values in the argillic horizon--more than 24 meq/100 grams of clay.  The Lares soils have low chroma mottles within 30 inches of the surface.  The Magens soils are dry for more than 90 cumulative days and occur in areas with less than 40 inches of annual rainfall.  The Sabana Seca soils are saturated with water some time of the year and have dominant low chroma colors."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Limones soils occur in strongly to moderately steep sideslopes and narrow ridgetops with slope gradients ranging from 20 to 60 percent.  The soil formed in fine textured residuum of very highly weathered plutonic rocks.  The climate is humid tropical. Average rainfall varies from 75 to 85 inches.  The mean annual temperature is from 77 to 80 degrees F."

The Ingenio soils have lower organic matter content in the argillic horizon.  The Jagueyes soils have coarser textured profiles, with less than 35 percent clay.  The Lirios soils have thinner argillic horizons.  The Los Guineos soils occur at higher elevations above sea level and have lower soil temperatures.  The Pandura and Patillas soils are underlaid by less weathered plutonic rocks."
