Flatron soils average 50 to 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Longcreek soils have 35 to 55 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are dry for 140 days out of 160 when soil temperatures exceed 5 degrees C.  Pioche soils have 35 to 55 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Ruckles soils have a Bt horizon with 50 to 60 percent clay and have surface textures influenced by loess and volcanic ash.  Vantage soils have a Btq horizon, have 30 percent silica coats on bedrock, and have surface textures influenced by loess."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Loomer soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on shoulder and backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as andesite, rhyolite, and basalt.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1520 to 2440 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature 7 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 130 days."
