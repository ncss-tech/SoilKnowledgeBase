  "OVERVIEW": "The Loomer Series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks.  Loomer soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature 7 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 130 days."
