Makawao soils are slightly acid throughout the B horizon and have continuous clay films in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Olelo soils have moderately thick continuous clay films in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Paaloa soils have moderately thick clay films in the upper part of the argillic horizon."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Leilehua soils are on uplands and have slopes of 2 to 12 percent.  They are at elevations of 900 to l,200 feet.  The soils formed in material weathered from basalt or old alluvium from the Koolau Range.  Annual rainfall is 55 to 75 inches, with about 3/4 of the total occurring from October thru April.  Mean annual temperature is about 70 degrees F., mean January temperature is 68 degrees F., and mean July temperature is 74 degrees F."

Manana soils have an ochric epipedon, moderately thick continuous clay films in the lower part of the argillic horizon and a panlike layer at depths of 15 to 50 inches.  Wahiawa soils do not have an argillic horizon and effervesce with hydrogen peroxide throughout the solum."
