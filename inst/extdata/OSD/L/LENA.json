  "OVERVIEW": "The Lena series consists of very poorly drained, soils in bogs within lake plains, till plains, and flood plains. These soils formed in highly decomposed organic materials more than 130 cm (51 inches) in thickness. They contain carbonates throughout. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F)., and mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches).",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The organic layers are more than 130 cm (51 inches) in thickness. The organic materials are primarily herbaceous but in some bogs pedons have a small percentage of woody material. Reaction in the upper part of the series control section ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nLayers within the series control section have hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR, or are neutral; value of 2 to 3; and chroma of 0 to 3. Some pedons contain hemic layers within the series control section and have higher value or chroma, or both. Chroma and value may change from 0.5 to 2 units from broken face to rubbed colors. The series control section typically contains carbonates throughout; however, some hemic layers may not have carbonates. The surface tier has structure ranging from thin to thick, platy to weak, fine to coarse, granular or subangular blocky. Reaction in the middle part ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nThe subsurface and bottom tiers have weak, thin to thick, platy or weak to moderate, fine to coarse, granular to subangular blocky structure, or are massive. Some pedons have layers of fibric material ranging to as much as 5 inches in thickness. Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline."
