  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The organic layers are more than 130 cm (51 inches) in thickness. The organic materials are primarily herbaceous but in some bogs pedons have a small percentage of woody material. Reaction in the upper part of the series control section ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nLayers within the series control section have hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR, or are neutral; value of 2 to 3; and chroma of 0 to 3. Some pedons contain hemic layers within the series control section and have higher value or chroma, or both. Chroma and value may change from 0.5 to 2 units from broken face to rubbed colors. The series control section typically contains carbonates throughout; however, some hemic layers may not have carbonates. The surface tier has structure ranging from thin to thick, platy to weak, fine to coarse, granular or subangular blocky. Reaction in the middle part ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nThe subsurface and bottom tiers have weak, thin to thick, platy or weak to moderate, fine to coarse, granular to subangular blocky structure, or are massive. Some pedons have layers of fibric material ranging to as much as 5 inches in thickness. Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline."

Adrain, Linwood, Palms, and Willette soils have less than 51 inches of organic deposits. Carlisle, Houghton, Peteetneet, Saltese, and Semiahmoo soils do not have carbonates in the control section. Edwards soils have marl within the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Slope gradients are less than 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 610 to 889 mm (24 to 35 inches), mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.2 to 11.1 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F.), frost free days range from 140 to 180 days, and the elevation ranges from 152 to 311 meters (500 to 1020 feet) above mean sea level."

Poorly drained or very poorly drained Aquolls are also associated in similar landscapes and in some places on the outer edges of bogs."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high (14.11 to 42.34 micrometers/second). Permeability is moderately rapid. An intermittant apparent water table is 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface in most years."
