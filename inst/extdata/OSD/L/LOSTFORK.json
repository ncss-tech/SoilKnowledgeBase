  "OVERVIEW": "The Lostfork series consists of very deep, very poorly or poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium and volcanic ash.  Lostfork soils are on stream terraces and flood plains in glacial outwash plains and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
