Organic matter content is 5 to 20 percent.  It is gravelly ashy loam. mucky ashy silt loam, or mucky ashy silty clay loam.  It contains 0 to 30 percent gravel and 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A2 and A3 horizons has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is ashy loam, ashy sandy loam or ashy clay loam with 15 to 35 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, and 15 to 30 percent clay.\nThe 2C horizons have value 2 to 4 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.

These soils formed in mixed alluvium and volcanic ash.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 28 inches, the mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F, and the frost-free period is 10 to 30 days."

The Damon soils are on stream terraces, are fine-silty, and lack gravel in the upper 40 inches.  The Silvies soils are on flood plains, are fine, and lack gravel in the upper 40 inches.  The Luckybutte soils are on flood plains along stream channels or abandon stream channels, and are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal. The Raycreek soils are located on adjacent ponderosa pine sites on hills and footslopes, are well drained, are fine-loamy, and have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches."
