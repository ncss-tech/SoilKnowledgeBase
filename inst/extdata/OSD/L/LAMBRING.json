  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lambring soils are on mountains and hills. They typically occur on north-facing backslope positions and are commonly associated with areas of rock outcrop and rubble land. These soils formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as tuff, basalt and andesite. Slopes are 5 to 70 percent. Elevations range from 1,220 to 2,045 meters. The climate is subhumid and characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 cm, the mean annual temperature is 3 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 90 days."

Erakatak soils are clayey-skeletal, have argillic horizons, and are moderately deep to lithic contacts. Observation soils are fine-textured, have argillic horizons, and are moderately deep to lithic contacts. Riddleranch soils have cambic horizons, an aridic moisture regime, and are moderately deep to lithic contacts."
