    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Largo soils are on valley bottoms, terraces, alluvial fans, and piedmont slopes. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  They formed in loamy calcareous alluvium derived from redbed formations of Jurassic, Triassic, Permian and Pennsylvanian age. Elevations range from 4000 to 5500 feet. The average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 12 inches, much of which falls in summer in heavy thunderstorms of short duration. The average annual air temperature is about 59 to 65 degrees F. The frost free period is 180 to 210 days."
