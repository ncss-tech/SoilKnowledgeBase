  "OVERVIEW": "The Lacita series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in silty calcareous sediments. Lacita soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

The 10- to 40-inch section ranges from silt loam or light silty clay loam to loam or light clay loam.\nThe A and AC horizons has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 6 dry, 4 through 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6. The AC horizon ranges from weak medium and coarse prismatic structure to very weak and weak or medium to coarse subangular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6. It has weak medium subangular blocky structure or is massive. Textures are silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alama, Largo, Montoya, Quay, Reyab, and San Jose series in other families. Alama and Reyab soils have cambic horizons. Largo soils are dry in all parts of the soil above the lower boundary of the moisture control section more than 1/2 the time the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. Montoya soils crack when dry and are 35 to 50 percent clay in the control section. San Jose soils are coarse-loamy. Quay soils have a calcic horizon within 40 inches of the surface and have a B2 horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lacita soils are on channeled arroyo bottoms, terraces, and low gradient piedmont slopes and alluvial fans. They formed in medium and moderately fine-textured silty calcareous sediments derived from \"redbed\" formations. These materials are readily susceptible to water erosion and on sloping areas Lacita soils are usually cut by numerous arroyos. THe climate is semiarid continental.  The mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees to 60 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 14 to 16 inches. More than 1/2 of the precipitation occurs between early June and the middle of September as thunderstorms. The frost-free season is 180 to 200 days."

Ima, La Lande, and Los Tanos soils have cambic horizons and contain more than 15 percent and coarser than very fine in the control section.  Also, Los Tanos soils have sandstone at depths of 20 to 40 inches."
