  "OVERVIEW": "The Libre series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess and the underlying outwash. These soils are on terraces, outwash plains, kames, and eskers. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
