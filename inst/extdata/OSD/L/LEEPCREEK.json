Climate models indicate higher precipitation in mapped areas of the Leepcreek soils. The soils are mapped along the southeast-facing flank of Hells Canyon, in areas where precipitation changes rapidly over a small geographical extent; therefore, the climate models may be incorrect.\nA moist phase that has a xeric soil moisture regime was included in Wallowa-Whitman National Forest. It is dominantly on north-facing slopes."
