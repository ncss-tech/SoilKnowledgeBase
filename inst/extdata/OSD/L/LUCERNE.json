    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is about 59 to 64 degrees F. and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F. at any time.  The soil from about 8 to 24 inches is usually moist in some part from early December to mid-March and is continuously dry the rest of the year.  Solum thickness is 40 to 80 inches.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 6/2, 6/3 or 6/4. Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 4/3 or 4/4.  This horizon is neutral or slightly acid.  Rock fragments range from 2 to 25 percent.\nThe B2t horizon is 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 6/6, 7/3; 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6).  Moist color is 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/6; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6).  This horizon is sandy loam with 8 to 18 percent clay and has at least 3 percent more clay than the A horizon and has 2 to 30 percent rock fragments.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline and is noncalcareous or slightly effervescent.\nOlder buried horizons occur frequently in these soils with depth to the upper boundary about 60 inches and lower boundaries below depths of 72 to 78 inches.  These horizons are heavy sandy loam, sandy clay loam or gravelly sandy loam and have about 5 to 20 percent by volume gravel.  Weathered granitic cobbles make up to 5 percent by volume.  Some pedons lack the buried B horizon and have a gravelly sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand C horizon."

The soil formed in alluvium from mixed but dominantly granitic sources. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool somewhat moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 9 inches, most of which occurs as rain in late autumn and winter.  Some moisture falls occasionally as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 57 to 63 degrees F.; the average January temperature is about 42 to 44 degrees F.; and the average July temperature is 82 to 84 degrees F.  The frost free season is 140 to 240 days."
