Textures throughout the profile are fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Gravel content is generally less than 5 percent but can range from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe A horizons have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chromas of 2 through 4.\nThe C horizon has hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chromas of 2 through 4.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.  Effervesence may be slight to violent."

Some minor areas are in urban developments for which they are well suited.  These soils are well suited to irrigated cropland where water is available."
