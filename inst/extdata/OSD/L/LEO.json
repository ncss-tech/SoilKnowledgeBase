  "OVERVIEW": "The Leo series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rocks. Leo soils are on alluvial fans, mountain valley fans, fan remnants, inset fans, and fan skirts. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
