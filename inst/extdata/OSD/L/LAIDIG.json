    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 50 to 80 inches or more. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 30 to 50 inches. The particle-size control section averages less than 35 percent rock fragments. Rock fragments range from 5 to 50 percent in individual subhorizons of the A, E, BE, BA and Bt horizons; 15 to 70 percent in individual subhorizons of the Btx horizon; and 20 to 70 percent in the C horizon. Rock fragments are mostly sandstone but include siltstone and shale. Rock fragments include channers, cobbles, flagstones, and stones. Unlimed soils range from extremely acid through strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. The Ap horizon, where present, has chroma of 2 to 8. Texture of the fine earth fraction is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. Texture of the fine earth fraction is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, and less commonly silt loam.\nSome pedons have an AB horizon. It has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture of the fine earth fraction is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture of the fine earth fraction is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or silt loam.\nSome pedons have a BA horizon. It has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 4. Texture of the fine earth fraction is loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Subhorizons immediately above the Btx horizon may have hue of 5YR. It may have redoximorphic features at a depth of 30 inches or more below the soil surface. Texture of the fine earth fraction is loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or silt loam. The Bt horizon has weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky structure.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. It has high and low chroma redoximorphic features. Texture of the fine earth fraction is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silt loam. It has weak very coarse prismatic structure parting to platy or subangular blocky.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 8 and has high and low chroma redoximorphic features.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silt loam."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Hogcreek and Yelton series in the same family. Hogcreek soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Yelton soils have less than 10 percent rock fragments above the fragipan. Marbie, Moomaw, Neabsco, Tarklin, and Teddy series in a related family.Marbie, Neabsco, and Teddy soils are moderately well drained and have a lithologic discontinuity below the fragipan. Additionally, Neabsco soils formed in fluvio-marine sediments on the Coastal Plain and contain rock fragments of mostly rounded quartz gravel. Moomaw soils have fragipans at a depth of 15 to 30 inches. Tarklin soils are moderately well drained, formed in alluvium or colluvium from limestone and contain chert fragments throughout. Additionally, Tarklin soils do not allow 5YR colors in the fragipan. Marbie, Neabsco, Tarklin, and Teddy soils are all in a semiactive CEC class."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Laidig soils are on middle and lower slopes. Slopes are mostly 8 to 55 percent but range from 0 to 55 percent. Laidig soils formed in loamy colluvium, 6 or more feet thick, derived largely from acid gray sandstone with small amounts of siltstone and shale of the adjacent uplands. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 60 inches; mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F."

The Andover soils are poorly drained and have a fragipan within 16 to 28 inches of the soil surface. Berks, Dekalb, Lehew, and Weikert soils are on uplands and are loamy-skeletal, have bedrock within 40 inches, and do not have fragipans and argillic horizons. Buchanan soils are on lower parts of the landscape and have low chroma mottles in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon. Clymer soils do not have a fragipan. Gilpin soils do not have a fragipan and have bedrock within 40 inches. Hazleton soils do not have a fragipan and an argillic horizon and are loamy-skeletal."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: 1. These soils were originally included in a mixed mineralogy family. 2. Major diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 14 inches (A, E, and BE horizons).\nb. Argillic horizon - the zone from 14 to 61 inches (Bt horizon).\nc. Fragipan - the zone from 36 to 61 inches (Btx horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: A coordinated study between the NENTC and the States of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia was carried out. All NSSL data analyzed indicated siliceous mineralogy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
