  "OVERVIEW": "The Laidig series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium from sandstone, siltstone, and some shale. They are gently sloping to very steep soils on benches and foot slopes. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid above the fragipan and moderately slow or slow in the fragipan. Slope ranges from 0 to 55 percent. Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

Marbie, Moomaw, Neabsco, Tarklin, and Teddy series in a related family.Marbie, Neabsco, and Teddy soils are moderately well drained and have a lithologic discontinuity below the fragipan. Additionally, Neabsco soils formed in fluvio-marine sediments on the Coastal Plain and contain rock fragments of mostly rounded quartz gravel. Moomaw soils have fragipans at a depth of 15 to 30 inches. Tarklin soils are moderately well drained, formed in alluvium or colluvium from limestone and contain chert fragments throughout. Additionally, Tarklin soils do not allow 5YR colors in the fragipan. Marbie, Neabsco, Tarklin, and Teddy soils are all in a semiactive CEC class."

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 14 inches (A, E, and BE horizons).\nb. Argillic horizon - the zone from 14 to 61 inches (Bt horizon).\nc. Fragipan - the zone from 36 to 61 inches (Btx horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: A coordinated study between the NENTC and the States of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia was carried out. All NSSL data analyzed indicated siliceous mineralogy.\n8/2021 revision: added loamy fine sand to the A and E horizons.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
