Bear Prairie soils have a solum with 10YR hue and an umbric epipedon 20 to 30 inches thick.  Calawah soils have 4 to 7 percent organic carbon in the upper two-thirds of the control section. Cinebar soils have a xeric moisture regime.  Hemcross soils have 5 to 30 percent rock fragments in the Bw horizon and have more than 4 percent organic carbon throughout the upper two-thirds of the particle-size control section. Mossyrock soils have a xeric moisture regime, an umbric epipedon 24 to 34 inches thick and are slightly acid or neutral in the control section.  Newaukum soils have a xeric moisture regime and 15 to 30 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Quillayute soils have an umbric epipedon more than 20 inches thick.  Trouter soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Winema soils have a solum with 10YR hue, an umbric epipedon 20 to 30 inches thick, and silty clay B2 horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are at elevations of 100 to 800 feet on terraces and terrace escarpments.  They formed in loess and old alluvium derived mostly from sandstone.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is 80 to 120 inches with most of the moisture as rainfall in the autumn-winter-spring season.  The mean January temperature is about 38 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 120 to 160 days. Growing season (28 degrees F) is 200 to 240 days."
