  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness and depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from neutral to very strongly acid in the upper part of the solum and from strongly acid to very strongly acid in the lower part.  Sandstone, siltstone, and shale fragments mostly 1/2 inch to 6 inches across, range from 0 to 30 percent by volume in the solum, and 5 to 60 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Ap horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam, and in some severely eroded pedons is silty clay.\nThe BA or BE horizons, when present, is 4 to 10 inches thick with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 8 with mottles in shades of brown, red, yellow, or gray or is mottled horizon in shades of brown, red, yellow, and gray in the lower part.  The gray colors in the lower B horizon are from weathered shale.  Texture is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 8, with mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow, olive, or gray or is mottled horizon with these colors.  Texture is silty clay or clay.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 5Y through 5YR, value 4 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 8.  The bedrock is soft acid clayey shale which is often interbedded with thin strata of siltstone or sandstone.  Some pedons have red streaks, mottles, or films of soil material between shale strata."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ebal, Fauquier, Montalto, Needmore, Norton, Orenda, Pisgah and Poplimento series in the same family.  The Ebal soils have a solum and depth to a paralithic contact from 50 to more than 80 inches.  Fauquier soils have greenstone bed at depths of more than 40 inches.  Montalto, Norton, Pisgah and Poplimento soils have sola more than 40 inches thick; in addition,  Montalto and Needmore soils lack the mottling in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  The Orenda soils have paralithic contact at 5 to 15 feet, and are formed in residuum for hornblende gneiss or hornblende schist and other mixed basic and acidic volcanogenic materials.  Needmore soils lack the low chroma mottles in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Bratton, Derinda, Edenton, Sequoia, and Townley series are in related families. Bratton, Derinda, and Edenton soils have base saturation of more than 35 percent.  In addition, Bratton and Derinda soils have an upper solum formed in loess, and Edenton soils have an upper solum formed in till.  Sequoia and Townley soils have base saturation of less than 35 percent in addition, Townley soils are warmer."

These soils formed in residuum of acid clayey shale which is often interbedded with thin strata of siltstone or sandstone.  Some pedons have a thin loess cap.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 56 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 52 inches."
