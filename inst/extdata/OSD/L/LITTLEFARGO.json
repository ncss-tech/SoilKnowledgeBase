The Dovecanyon, Friedliver, Goldivide, Goldpeak, Helendale, Jumborox, Searchlight, Sonoita, and Tray soils are all very deep soils and do not have a paralithic contact within 150 centimeters, and are formed mainly in alluvium. Hexie soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 19 to 22 degrees C. Wingap soils have a paralithic contact between 100 and 150 centimeters. In addition, Sonoita soils are moist greater than 20 days cumulative in some part of the soil moisture control section following summer convection storms. Friedliver soils have an upper boundary to the argillic between 25 and 50 centimeters, and Goldivide soils within 50 to 100 centimeters. Tray soils are strongly to very strongly alkaline in all parts and have an argillic horizon with an ESP of 15 to 30."
