Texture is silt loam, clay loam, silty clay loam or clay.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5\nmoist, and chroma of 2 to 4. It has crystals of gypsum amounting to 2 to 12 percent in the form of crystals, threads and masses. Gypsum averages less than 1.5 percent by weight."

Camino soils have a paralithic contact between 40 and 60 inches. Gish and Losmarios soils are very deep. Anamite soils have thermic temperature. Bufton soils do not have a paralithic contact within depth of 60 inches. Colona, Dominquez, and Heldt soils have smectitic mineralogy. Galisteo and Vermejo soils do not have a cambic horizon. Galisteo soils also have hue less yellow than 10YR. Ordway soils have more than 1.5 percent gypsum in the control section."

Slopes are dominantly 1 to 3 percent but range from 1 to 9 percent. The average annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches. The average annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F. The frost free season is 140 to 160 days. Elevations range from 4,400 to 6,700 feet."
