  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates ranges from 14 to 40 inches.  The soil is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness.  The depth to finer textured materials ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The clay content of these materials ranges from 18 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 in the upper part and 1 or 2 in the lower part.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 2 to 5 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It typically is fine sandy loam, but it is sandy loam in some pedons.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a 2Bw horizon.\nThe 2Bk horizon has 10YR to 5Y hue, value of 4 to 6 and 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.   It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have Bk or 2BC horizons.\nThe 2C horizon has 2.5Y or 5Y hue, value of 4 to 6 and 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is loam, clay loam or silt loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It has few to common and faint to distinct mottles in the lower part of most pedons.  It does not have mottles in some pedons.  In some pedons it has coarser or finer textures below depths of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slope gradients typically are less than 4 percent but range from 0 to 12 percent.  The soil formed in loamy sediments overlying finer textured loamy glacial till or laminated lacustrine sediments.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 degrees to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 24 inches."

Dickey soils have more sand in the upper part of the control section.  Swenoda soils are on lower concave slopes and nearly level positions.  Swenoda soils have a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches thick."
