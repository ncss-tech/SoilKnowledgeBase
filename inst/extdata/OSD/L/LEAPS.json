  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Leaps series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, or colluvium mainly from shale, with influence from sandstone in places.  These soils are on alluvial fans, structural benches, mountain slopes, mesas, hills, and valley sides.  Slopes are 3 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
