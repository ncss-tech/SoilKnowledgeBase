  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 35 inches and generally is the same as the depth to the dense substratum. Texture of the solum is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam with more than 65 percent silt plus very fine sand. Stones ranges from 0 to 25 percent in the A horizon, 0 to 10 percent in the B horizon, and 5 to 10 percent in the C horizon. Channers range from 5 to 25 percent in the A horizon, and 10 to 40 percent in the B and C horizons. Flagstones range from 0 to 10 percent in the B and C horizons. In some places the rock fragments include small amounts of gravel or cobbles. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. A horizons have weak or moderate, fine or medium granular structure and friable or very friable consistence. Some pedons have 1 to 4 inch thick 0 horizons.\nThin E horizons are present in some pedons.\nThe upper part of the B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. The lower part of the B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, with value and chroma ranges the same as the upper part. Chroma of 2 is inherited and is not due to wetness. Structure is weak or moderate, fine, or medium granular or subangular blocky and consistence is very friable or friable.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon up to 9 inches thick. The color and texture are similar to the B horizon.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and commonly chroma of 2 or 3. The chroma is 1 in some places. It has weak or moderate, thin to medium platy structure or it is massive. Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam. It is firm or very firm."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lanesboro soils are on glaciated uplands and drumlins. Slope commonly is 8 to 25 percent but ranges from 0 to 45 percent. The soils formed in acid till derived mainly from dark gray phyllite, shale, slate, and schist. Mean annual temperature ranges from 43 to 49 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches. The frost-free period ranges from 90 to 130 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brayton, Dummerston, Fullam, Hoosic, Macomber, Quonset, and Taconic soils. The poorly drained Brayton soils and moderately well drained Fullam soils are associated in a drainage sequence with Lanesboro. The well drained Dummerston soils are in similar landscape positions as Lanesboro soils and have friable substrata. The shallow, somewhat excessively drained Taconic soils and moderately deep, well drained Macomber soils are on nearby bedrock controlled landscapes. The excessively drained Quonset and Hoosic soils are on nearby outwash plains, terraces, eskers, and kames."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Location determined from narrative description in published soil survey. Cation-exchange activity class is presumed from a review of data of similar soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 2 inches (A horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 2 to 29 inches (Bw horizon).\n3. Coarse-loamy feature - the clay content averages about 12 percent in the 10 to 40 inch zone.\n4. Oxyaquic feature - presence of a water saturated layer within 40 inches (Cd horizon with redoximorphic features) for one month most years.\n5. Densic contact - firm relatively unaltered material at 29 inches (Cd horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
