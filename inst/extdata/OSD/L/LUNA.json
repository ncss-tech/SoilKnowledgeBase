They formed in place from ash and tuff with some influence from cinders and basalt.  These soils are at elevations of 7,000 to 8,600 feet in a continental climate with a mean annual precipitation of 18 to 30 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 37 degrees to 47 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 85 to 120 days."
