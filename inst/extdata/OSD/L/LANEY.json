  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soils temperature is 40 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is 62 degrees F. Depth to calcareous material ranges from 0 to 10 inches. The soils are strongly or very strongly alkaline. Exchangeable sodium ranges from 15 to 50 percent with some subhorizons totaling at least 4 inches in thickness and exceeding 15 percent exchangeable sodium occurring above a depth of 24 inches. Conductivity ranges from 0 to 14 millimhos in a majority of subhorizons above 24 inches. The rock fragments are dominantly 1 to 10 inches in diameter. Hue ranges from 5Y through 7.5YR except that a few subhorizons having hue redder than 7.5YR occur discontinuously in some pedons and occupy less than half the thickness of the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  Laney soils are on nearly level to gently sloping flood plains and alluvial fans. Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium but are usually derived from sedimentary rock. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 8 inches, approximately 4 inches of which falls during the summer months."
