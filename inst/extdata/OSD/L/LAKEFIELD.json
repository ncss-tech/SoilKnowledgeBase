  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Free carbonates are commonly at the surface but range to a depth of 10 inches. The sola and C horizons typically lack coarse fragments.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 inches) in thickness. The 25 to 102 cm (10- to 40-inch) control section typically averages between 22 and 30 percent clay with a range of 18 to 35 percent and typically 2 to 8 percent fine sand and coarser but ranging to as much as 15 percent.  The Bk and BCk have an increase in carbonates but do not qualify for a calcic horizon.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1. It typically is silty clay loam or silt loam. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Some pedons have an AB or BA horizon.\nThe Bkg horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silty clay loam or silt loam. It is moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon.\nThe BCkg or Cg horizon have 2.5Y or 5Y hue, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam. In some pedons it is stratified with these textures as well as having thin coarser textured strata. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

All of these soils except Corwith lack free carbonates within depth of 51 cm (20 inches).   Corwith soils have less clay in the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils have plane or slightly convex slopes on glacial lake plains. Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in very deep, calcareous, silty lacustrine sediments of Late Wisconsinan age. Mean annual temperature is approximately 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is approximately 660 to 813 mm (26 to 32 inches). Frost-free period ranges from 155 to 200 days. Elevation ranges from 244 to 479 m (800 to 1,570 feet)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The main ones are the Madelia, Okoboji, Spicer and Truman soils which form a drainage sequence with the Lakefield soils, and the competing Kingston soils. The poorly drained Madelia and Spicer soils are on nearly level slopes. The very poorly drained Okoboji soils are in depressions. The well drained Truman soils are on more sloping terrain. The Kingston soils are in similar positions."

The saturated hydraulic conductivity is 4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second (.6 to 2.0 inches). Saturation is as high as 46 cm (1.5 feet) at some time from March to June and October and November in normal years."
