  "OVERVIEW": "The Liv series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in clayey cobbly and gravelly materials over weathered tuff and igneous bedrock.  These soils are on gently sloping to steep slopes on igneous mountains.  Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent.",
