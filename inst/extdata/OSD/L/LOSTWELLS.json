  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually calcareous throughout but are leached to depth of 10 inches in some pedons.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  Organic carbon in the surface horizon ranges from 0.3 to 1 percent and decreases irregularly with increasing depth.  The control section contains thin lenses of sandy loam and clay loam.  The weighted average texture is sandy clay loam, having more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments, mainly gravel, are typically less than 5 percent but range from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline."

Battlerock and Youngston soils have less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the control section. Boysen soils have a pH of 9.0 or greater and exchangeable sodium percentage in excess of 15 in a major part of the control section.  Binton soils have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium.  Clayhole soils have horizons of gypsum accumulation. Jocity soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder.  Toddler soils have more than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lostwells soils are on alluvial terraces and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  The soils formed in thick, calcareous, stratified alluvial material derived principally from sandstones or rain in April, May, and early June.  Elevations range from 3,800 to 6,300 feet.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F.  Estimated frost-free season is 110 to 140 days depending upon aspect, elevation, and air drainage."
