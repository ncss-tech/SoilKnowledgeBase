The profile is noncalcareous to a depth of 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon when mixed to 7 inches has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It has weak to moderate granular to weak subangular blocky structure. It has 3.5 to 5.5 percent organic matter having a C:N ratio of 10 to 13. It ranges in pH from 6.5 to 7.4\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silt loam or silty clay loam and averages 24 to 30 percent clay and less than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand. It ranges in pH from 6.6 to 7.8."
