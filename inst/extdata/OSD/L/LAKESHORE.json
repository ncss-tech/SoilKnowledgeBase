  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lakeshore soils are on lake plains and lake terraces adjoining small ponds.  These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks such as limestone, quartzite, shale, and sandstone.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 4,400 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 66 to 71 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 160 to 180 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Leland, Saltair, and Warm Springs soils.  Leland soils are fine-loamy, have natric horizons, have seasonal high water tables at 30 to 48 inches in depth, and occur under alkali sacaton and black greasewood.  Saltair soils are fine-silty.  Warm Springs soils are fine-loamy, have mollic epipedons and calcic horizons, and occur under alkali sacaton."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; negligible surface runoff; slow permeability (moderately low or moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between the soil surface and 1.7 feet (very shallow and shallow free water occurrence classes) year-round.  Cumulative annual duration class is Persistent.  These soils are susceptible to occasional ponding for brief duration from March through July with water up to 6 inches deep."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 4 inches (Az horizon).\nSalic horizon - The zone from the soil surface to 64 inches (Az, Czg1, Czg2, Czg3, Czg4, and Czg5 horizons).\nAquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between the soil surface and 20 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the Az, Czg1, Czg2, Czg3, and Czg4 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (Czg3 horizon and parts of the Czg2 and Czg4 horizons).\nThe soil was last reviewed in the field in 1965.  It needs to be determined if the soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts at some time during normal years.  The height and duration of the seasonal high water needs to be verified in the field.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 140-141, Table 11 of the Soil Survey of Davis-Weber Area, Utah.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
