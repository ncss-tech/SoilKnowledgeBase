    "content": "REMARKS: Lawnes soils were included with Lanexa series and fresh water and salt water tidal marshes in the past.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 13 inches.\n2) Electrical conductivity less than 8 dS/m in more than half the upper 1 meter of soil.\n3) Less than 80 cmol of soluble Ca, Mg, K, and Na per liter of saturation extract in more than half the upper 1 meter of soil.\n4) Less than 0.75 percent sulfur in the upper 20 inches of the soil.\nThe diagnostic features recognized may be submitted for a proposed Fluvic Sulfaquent subgroup. Typic subgroup requires sulfur to be greater than 0.75 percent. Diagnostic features will be recognized as series criteria.\nSIR = VA0347\nMLRA = 133A, 153A, 153B\nREVISED = 1/18/91\nADDITIONAL DATA: Chesapeake Bay Tidal Wetland Soils in Virginia: A Pilot Characterization, Edmonds, W.
