  "OVERVIEW": "The Lostlake series consists of shallow or very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and slope alluvium derived from granite.  Lostlake soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 30 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F.",

It is presumed to result from the significant amount of iron and aluminum oxides in this pedon."
