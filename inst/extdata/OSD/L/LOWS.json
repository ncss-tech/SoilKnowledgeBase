  "STATES": "WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lows series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loamy alluvium underlain by sandy alluvium on valley trains.  Permeability is moderate in the loamy alluvium and rapid or very rapid in the sandy alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:   Thickness of the loamy alluvium and the depth to sandy alluvium ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the loamy alluvium and from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy alluvium.  Lows soils have aquic conditions for some time in most years, unless artificially drained, in a layer between 16 and 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam or loam. Where cultivated, the Ap horizon has color and texture similar to the A horizon.  Reaction typically ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid, but ranges to neutral where limed.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, silt loam, or sandy loam.  Reaction typically ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid, but ranges to neutral where limed.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, silt loam, or sandy clay loam.  Reaction typically ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid, but ranges to neutral in the upper part where limed.\nSome pedons have a 2BCg horizon with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loamy sand or sand.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is fine sand, loamy sand, sand, or coarse sand and often stratified at widely-spaced intervals by thin layers of finer textured material.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid."
