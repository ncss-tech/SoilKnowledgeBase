  "OVERVIEW": "The Lilbert series consists of very deep, well drained soils.  These gently to moderately sloping soils formed in sandy and loamy marine deposits on uplands on the Claiborne geologic group.  Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (65 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 in).",
