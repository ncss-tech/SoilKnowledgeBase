Rock fragments of quartz gravel range from 1 to 20 percent in the A and E horizon, 1 to 10 percent in the B and C horizon, and up to 50 percent in thin strata of the C horizon.  The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid, unless limed.  Few flakes of mica are in the B and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy loam, loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.  Pedons with eroded surfaces include sandy clay loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is sandy loam, loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is clay, sandy clay or clay loam.  BE and BC horizons, where present, include sandy clay loam textures.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 8, and chroma of 2 through 8.  Mottling in shades of white, yellow, brown and black are common.  It is sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  The C horizon commonly has high feldspathic sand content.  Some areas have lenses and strata of gray marine clay in the C horizon."
