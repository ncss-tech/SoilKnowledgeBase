  "OVERVIEW": "The Lapoin series consists of moderately well drained soils which are moderately deep to a lithic contact with sandstone.  They formed in a thin mantle of loamy alluvium and in clayey till underlain by loamy till on bedrock controlled areas of till plains.  Permeability is moderate in the loamy mantle and in the loamy substratum, slow in the clayey till, and moderately slow or moderate in the bedrock.  Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and to a lithic contact with sandstone range from 20 to 40 inches and in some pedons they coincide.  Thickness of the loamy mantle ranges from 3 to 10 inches.  The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  Free carbonates are in some pedons at a depth of 24 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments are of mixed lithology.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 3 percent throughout.  Volume of stones ranges from 0 to 1 percent throughout.  Redox accumulations are below the spodic horizon and within 40 inches.  Saturation occurs within 40 inches for 1 month or more per year in most years.\nThe O horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 3.  The O horizon is a mat of highly decomposed forest litter.

Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nLapoin soils have a glossic horizon (2E/B or 2B/E horizon, or both). The 2E part has color like the E horizon described above.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  The 2Bt part has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value and chroma of 3 or 4.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together.  It is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the glossic horizon.\nThe 2Bt horizon has color and texture like the 2Bt part described above.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a 2Btk horizon with color and texture like the 2Bt horizon described above.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a 2C horizon with color and texture like the 2Bt horizon described above.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.
