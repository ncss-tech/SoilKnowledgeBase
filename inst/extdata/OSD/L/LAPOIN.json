    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, depth and thickness are measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and to a lithic contact with sandstone range from 20 to 40 inches and in some pedons they coincide.  Thickness of the loamy mantle ranges from 3 to 10 inches.  The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  Free carbonates are in some pedons at a depth of 24 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments are of mixed lithology.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 3 percent throughout.  Volume of stones ranges from 0 to 1 percent throughout.  Redox accumulations are below the spodic horizon and within 40 inches.  Saturation occurs within 40 inches for 1 month or more per year in most years.\nThe O horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 3.  The O horizon is a mat of highly decomposed forest litter.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nLapoin soils have a glossic horizon (2E/B or 2B/E horizon, or both). The 2E part has color like the E horizon described above.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  The 2Bt part has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value and chroma of 3 or 4.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together.  It is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the glossic horizon.\nThe 2Bt horizon has color and texture like the 2Bt part described above.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a 2Btk horizon with color and texture like the 2Bt horizon described above.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a 2C horizon with color and texture like the 2Bt horizon described above.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 4R horizon (3R horizon in pedons without a 3C horizon) has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value of 4 or 5."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lapoin soils are on sandstone bedrock controlled till plains.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent.  These soils formed in a thin mantle of loamy alluvium and in clayey till underlain by loamy till on bedrock controlled areas of till plains.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from 90 to 120 days.  Elevation ranges from 600 to 1,000 feet."

The moderately well drained Abbaye soils are nearby in landscape positions similar to Lapoin soils where there is 20 to 40 inches of loamy till over the sandstone.  The excessively drained Brownstone and Deerton soils are nearby in similar landscape positions where there is 20 to 40 inches of sandy outwash over the sandstone.  Morganlake soils are in similar landscape positions where there is 20 to 40 inches of sandy outwash over loamy till.  The excessively drained Redrim soils are in similar landscape positions where there is 10 to 20 inches of sandy outwash over the sandstone.  The somewhat poorly drained Zeba soils are nearby in slightly lower landscape positions where the soil is formed in 20 to 40 inches of loamy till over the sandstone."
