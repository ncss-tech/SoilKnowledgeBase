  "OVERVIEW": "The Little Wood series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess, alluvium, and residuum from mixed sources.  Little Wood soils are on fan terraces, stream terraces, and dissected alluvial terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very rapid below.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Apmat soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the argillic and occur in a 20 to 35 inch precipitation.  Durst, Fraval, Kalo, Klicker, Mulshoe, and Sapkin soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Fergie soils have bedrock at 50 to 60 inches.  Henhoit and Klickson are deeper than 34 inches to the base of the argillic.  In addition, Henhoit has a base saturation of more than 75 in some part of the upper 30 inches.  Klickson soils have an O horizon.  Morningstar soils have O horizons and lack sandy-skeletal material immediately below the argillic horizon.  Sattley soils lack a sandy-skeletal layer immediately below the argillic above 40 inches and are dry 120 consecutive days during summer and fall."

The soil formed in loess, alluvium, and residuum from mixed sources.  Elevation ranges from 4,700 to 6,200 feet.  The annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rain.  The average annual air temperature is about 40 to 46 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 60 to 110 days."
