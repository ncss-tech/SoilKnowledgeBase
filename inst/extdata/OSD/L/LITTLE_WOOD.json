    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Apmat, Durst, Fergie, Fraval, Henhoit, Kalo, Klicker, Klickson, Morningstar, Mulshoe, Sapkin, and Sattley series.  Apmat soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the argillic and occur in a 20 to 35 inch precipitation.  Durst, Fraval, Kalo, Klicker, Mulshoe, and Sapkin soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Fergie soils have bedrock at 50 to 60 inches.  Henhoit and Klickson are deeper than 34 inches to the base of the argillic.  In addition, Henhoit has a base saturation of more than 75 in some part of the upper 30 inches.  Klickson soils have an O horizon.  Morningstar soils have O horizons and lack sandy-skeletal material immediately below the argillic horizon.  Sattley soils lack a sandy-skeletal layer immediately below the argillic above 40 inches and are dry 120 consecutive days during summer and fall."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Little Wood soils are on fan terraces, stream terraces, and dissected alluvial terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The soil formed in loess, alluvium, and residuum from mixed sources.  Elevation ranges from 4,700 to 6,200 feet.  The annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rain.  The average annual air temperature is about 40 to 46 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 60 to 110 days."
