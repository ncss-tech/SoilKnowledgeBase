The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from March 15 to December 1 (255 days) and exceeds 47 degrees F from April 15 to November 15 (210 days).  The soil is dry from June 1 to November 10 (160 days) and is never moist for 90 consecutive days when the soil temperature is greater than 47 degrees F.  The moisture control section is dry more than half the time the soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F.  There are 35 to 55 percent stones and cobbles on the soil surface.  Content of clay ranges from 20 to 25 percent.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/2, 6/3; 7.5YR 6/2, 6/3 or 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3; 7.5YR 4/2.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 55 percent.  Stones and cobbles range from 25 to 40 percent. Gravel range from 10 to 25 percent.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/2, 6/3; and 7.5YR 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/4, 4/3, 4/2; 7.5YR 4/2 or 4/4.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 55 percent.  Stones and cobbles range from 15 to 25 percent.  Gravel ranges from 20 to 30 percent."

Jobpeak, Tejabe and Wahguyhe soils have a control section that average 10 to 18 percent clay.  Skeddadle soils have a paralithic contact above basalt bedrock, also mean annual soil temperature that is less than 52 degrees F.  Smallcone soils are strongly or medium acid and average less than 18 percent clay in the textural control section.  Snaker soils are greater than 10 inches deep to bedrock."

Clay content by hydrometer method is 20 percent.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.
