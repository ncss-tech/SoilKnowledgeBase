The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from granite and grano-diorite.  The winters are cool and moist and the summers are warm and dry.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F; the mean July temperature is 67 degrees F; and the mean January temperature is 40 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches. The frost-free period is 100 to 200 days."
