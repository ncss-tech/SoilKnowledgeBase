  "OVERVIEW": "The Lemco series consists of very deep, well-drained soils formed in slope alluvium derived dominantly from quartzite.  Lemco soils are on mountains and have slopes of 20 to 50 percent.  Permeability is slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
