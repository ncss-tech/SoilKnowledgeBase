The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granite, gneiss, or schist, with small amounts of loess and volcanic ash mixed in the upper part of the profile. The mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 49 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 35 inches. The frost-free season is 90 to 130 days."
