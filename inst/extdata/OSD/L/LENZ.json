  "OVERVIEW": "The Lenz series consists of moderately deep, well-drained soils formed in material weathered from gneiss, schist, and granite, with small amounts of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. These soils are on mountain and foothill side slopes. Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
