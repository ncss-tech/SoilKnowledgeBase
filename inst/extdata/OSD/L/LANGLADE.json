  "OVERVIEW": "The Langlade series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a mantle of loess or silty alluvium and in loamy alluvium overlying sandy and gravelly outwash on outwash plains.  Permeability is moderate in the silty and loamy deposits and rapid or very rapid in the sandy outwash. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and depth to sandy outwash both range from 40 to 60 inches and coincide in some pedons.  Thickness of the  silty mantle ranges from 26 to 42 inches. The particle-size control section averages between 6 and 18 percent clay. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the silty mantle , from 0 to 25 percent in the 2Bt horizons, and from 5 to 60 percent in individual strata in the sandy outwash. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 2 percent in the silty mantle  and from 0 to 5 percent below. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum and from strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.  Some pedons exhibit characteristics in the lower horizons similar to fragipans, such as firm consistence and platy structure, but these features are not believed to be diagnostic.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Value is greater than 5.5 when dry.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture of the Ap or A horizon is silt loam.\nSome pedons have a Bs horizon as much as 9 inches thick immediately below the Ap or A horizon.  The Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 4. It does not meet the chemical requirements for a spodic horizon. Texture is silt loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value, dry, of 7 or more. Texture is silt loam.\nLanglade soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above. .\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nSome pedons have a 3Bt or 3BC horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is ,  loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand or coarse sand or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is stratified sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogs."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included with the Antigo series as a deep phase.  Langlade pedons appear to straddle coarse-silty, fine-loamy, and coarse-loamy particle-size family; however, the coarse-loamy particle-size appears to be the best placement for the use and management of this soil.  As time permits, a more representative pedon should be selected to characterize the Langlade series in the coarse-loamy particle-size class.\nDiagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:  Ochric epipedon - 0 to 12 inches (Ap).  Albic horizon - 12 to 14 inches (E).  Argillic horizon - 14 to 53 inches (B/E, Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, 3Bt4).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to Soil Survey Sample number S8WI-067-341 for NSSL data  on the typical pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
