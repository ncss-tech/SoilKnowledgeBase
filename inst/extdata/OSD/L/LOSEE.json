    "content": "TYPICAL PEDON: Losee gravelly loam - rangeland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)\nA--0 to 4 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) gravelly loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; weak thin platy structure that parts to weak fine granular; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky, slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine and medium roots; few fine pores; 15 percent gravel; mildly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)\nBt1--4 to 9 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) gravelly light clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, plastic; common very fine, fine and medium and few coarse roots; few fine pores; few thin clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent in spots; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 8 inches thick)\nBt2--9 to 17 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) gravelly light sandy clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium, and few coarse roots; few fine pores; few thin clay films on faces of peds; 30 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; mildly alkaline (pH 7.7); abrupt smooth boundary. (O to 10 inches thick)\nCl--17 to 32 inches; reddish yellow and yellowish red (5YR 6/8 and 5/6) very gravelly heavy loam, yellowish red (5YR 6/4) moist crushed; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine, medium and coarse roots; very fine and fine pores; few thin clay films in pores; 75 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (12 to 22 inches thick)\nC2--32 to 55 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/8) very gravelly loam, yellowish red (5YR 5/8) moist; massive; very hard, friable, nonsticky, slightly plastic; few medium roots with several lenses of root mat; many very fine and fine pores; 75 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6).\nType Location: Kane County, Utah; Crawford Creek; NW1/4 SW1/4 sec. 6, T.39S., R.4W.\nRange in Characteristics: Rock fragments average 35 to 70 percent in the B2 and C horizons. The mean annual soil temperature is about 38 to 42 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 54 to 58 degrees F. These soils are usually moist in some part of the soil between depths of 4 and 12 inches. They are dry for 90 cumulative days or more in some parts of the moisture control section, but are not continuously dry in all parts of the moisture control section for as long as 60 days.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist. If value is less than 3.6 moist and chroma is less than 4 moist, the horizon is less than 7 inches thick. This horizon is noneffervescent to moderately effervescent.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry and moist. It ranges from gravelly and very gravelly or cobbly heavy loam to gravelly and very gravelly or very cobbly light clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 8. It ranges from sandy loam to loam or silt loam and is gravelly, very gravelly cobbly or very cobbly.\nCompeting Series and their Differentiae: These are the Blackleed, Devore, Elve, Firada, Garlet, Namge, Scout, and Taglake series.  Blackleed soils have an A&B horizon containing lamellae and are noncalcareous throughout. Devore and Firada soils have bedrook at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Garlet soil have hue of 2.5Y in the control section and have an E horizon that extends into the B horizon.\nSetting: The Losee soils are on gently to moderately steep alluvial fans and cones or on steep dnd very steep mountain slopes. Elevations range from 7,800 to 8,750 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 14 to 21 inches and the frost free period ranges from 60 to 75 days. The mean annual temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is 54 to 58 degrees F.\nGeographically Associated Soils: These are the Osote, Skutum, and Swapps soils and the competing Pahreah solils. Osote, Skutum, and Swapps soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.\nDrainage and Permeability: Well and somewhat excessively drained; medium runoff; moderately rapid to moderately slow permeability.\nUse and Vegetation: Timber, rangeland, and wildlife. The native vegetation is ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, white fir, aspen, snowberry, creeping juniper, mutton bluegrass, and phlox,\nDistribution and Extent: These soils are in the south central part of Utah. They are inextensive.\nSeries Established: Paunsaugunt Survey Area, Utah, 1969.\nRemarks: These soils were formerly classified as Gray Wooded soils.\nOSED scanned by NSSQA.  Last revised by state on 4/73.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
