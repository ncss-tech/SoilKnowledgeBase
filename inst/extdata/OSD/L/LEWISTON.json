  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.  Depth to the horizon of carbonate accumulation is 12 to 16 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 degrees to 51 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at 20 inches depth is 65 degrees to 70 degrees F.  The soils are saturated with water at some period during the year unless drained.  The depth to water table is 26 to 40 inches, where the soils have not been drained. The control section averages fine sandy loam.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3, it has 1 to 3 percent organic matter, it has weak to moderate fine to medium granular or weak coarse to fine subangular blocky structure.  It is mildly to strongly alkaline.\nThe Ck and C horizons have hue of l0YR or 7 5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  Textures range from loam to loamy fine sand.  Reaction ranges from moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline."

They formed in moderately coarse, mixed lake sediments. The climate is dry subhumid, mean annual temperature is 45 degrees to 48 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 68 degrees to 72 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 13 to 17 inches.  The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 13 inches (Ap and A horizons).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 13 to 22 inches based on 1971 series description horizon designations (Ck1 and Ck2 horizons).\nThe series was last reviewed in the field in 1971.  The depths to a seasonal high water table need to be verified in the field.\nThere are soils named Lewiston that were correlated in the Soil Survey of Bradley County, Arkansas in 1959.  These soils need future correlation to another series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
