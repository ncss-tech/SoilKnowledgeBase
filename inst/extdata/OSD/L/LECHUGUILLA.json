  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The competing series are Brewster, Budlamp, Tortugas and Yarbam. Brewster soils are formed from igneous rocks, have 5YR hue and have no B horizons. Budlamp soils have only 5 to 18 percent clay in the control section, have no cobbles in the A or on the surface and are typically formed on granite.  Yarbam series contains only 5 to 18 percent clay in the control section, does not have secondary carbonates but typically has a calcium carbonate equivalent between 5 and 40 percent and is in the aridic ustic moisture regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lechuguilla soils are on slopes and summits of mountains, hills and ridges. Slope ranges from 1 to 70 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium on mostly convex surfaces in limestone and dolomite. Elevations are 3,400 to 5,000 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 in, mostly occurring as high intensity rain during afternoon thunderstorms from July to September; mean annual air temperature is 57 to 61 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 212 to 246 days."
