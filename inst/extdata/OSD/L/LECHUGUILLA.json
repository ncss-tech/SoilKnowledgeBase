  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lechuguilla series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from limestone and dolomite. Lechuguilla soils are on back slopes of hills and on mountain flanks and scarps. Slope ranges from 1 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Budlamp soils have only 5 to 18 percent clay in the control section, have no cobbles in the A or on the surface and are typically formed on granite.  Yarbam series contains only 5 to 18 percent clay in the control section, does not have secondary carbonates but typically has a calcium carbonate equivalent between 5 and 40 percent and is in the aridic ustic moisture regime."
