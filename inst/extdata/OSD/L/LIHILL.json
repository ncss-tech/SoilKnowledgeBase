  "OVERVIEW": "The Lihill series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and eolian deposits.  These soils are on stream terraces, dunes, till plains and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon from the surface to 13 inches (A1 horizon - the A2 has the color but not the organic carbon content to be mollic); particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (A1, A2 and C horizons).\nThe Lihill series was previously mapped as the Lihen series in MLRAs 58A and 52.  The series is proposed because changes in taxonomy redefine the criteria for Torriorthentic Haplustolls."
