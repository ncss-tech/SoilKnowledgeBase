  "OVERVIEW": "The Lubbock series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loess over alluvium. They occur on nearly level to slightly depressional areas on paleoterraces of the Central High Tableland (MLRA 72). Slope gradients range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 48 centimeters (19 inches), and mean annual temperature is 12 C degrees (54 degrees F).",
