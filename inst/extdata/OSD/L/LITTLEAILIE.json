  "OVERVIEW": "The Littleailie series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff. Littleailie soils are on eroded fan remnants and ballenas. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
