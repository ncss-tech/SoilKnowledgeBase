Slickensides and/or wedge-shaped aggregates and pressure faces range from few to common throughout the argillic horizon.   Linear extensibility is greater than 2.5 inches (6.0 cm) in the upper 40 inches (100 cm) of the soil.  COLE ranges from 0.07 to 0.10 in the upper 50 inches of the argillic horizon.    Siliceous pebbles range from none to 10 percent of some subhorizons.  Most pedons contain secondary carbonates, barite masses, or gypsum crystals beginning at a depth of 40 to 70 inches.  Redox features are both relict and contemporary.  The soil does not have aquic soil conditions in most years.\nThe combined thickness of the A and E horizon averages less than 10 inches in more than 50 percent of the pedon, but ranges up to 15 inches thick in subsoil troughs.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redox concentrations range from few to many in shades of brown or yellow.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.  The boundary between the A or E and Bt horizon is abrupt.\nThe upper part of the Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redox features range from few to common in shades of brown, olive or yellow.  Texture is clay loam or clay, with clay content ranging from 35 to 45 percent.  Reaction of the Btg1 horizon is very strongly acid or strongly acid.  Reaction of the Btg2 ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe middle and lower part of the Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redox features in shades of brown, yellow, gray or red range from few to common in most pedons.  Texture is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or clay with clay content of 25 to 45 percent.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe BCg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redox concentrations in shades of yellow or brown range from none to common.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam with clay content of 20 to 30 percent.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nIn some pedons, a 2C horizon is present below a depth of 60 inches.  This horizon is siltstone, mudstone, shale or is stratified with these loamy and clayey geological materials."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Mabank series.  Similar soils are the Edna, Derly, Herty, Oakhurst, Wilson, and Zulch series.  Mabank soils are less acid in the upper Btg horizon.  Edna soils are less acid in the upper Btg horizon, and are in the udic moisture regime.  Derly soils have glossic horizons, and have aquic conditions within 20 inches of the surface.  Herty soils are strongly to very strongly acid in the Btg horizon and are in the udic moisture regime.  Oakhurst soils are in the udic moisture regime.  Wilson soils do not have an abrupt textural change between the A and Btg horizons.  Zulch soils have sola less than 40 inches thick over geologic materials."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lufkin soils are on nearly level high terraces or remnants of terraces associated with uplands. They are typically 75 to 125 feet above major flood plains.  Some areas are in slight depressions.  Slopes are mainly less than 1 percent but range from 0 to 3 percent.  Lufkin soils formed in slightly acid to alkaline clayey sediments. Mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 70 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 40 inches.  Frost free days range from 230 to 275 days and elevation ranges from 230 to 500 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices from 50 to 70."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Axtell, Crockett, Edge, Freestone, Rader and Tabor series.  Axtell, Freestone, and Crockett soils have chroma of more than 2 in the subsoil and are slightly higher in the landscape.  Edge soils have reddish subsoils and are on higher upland positions with convex slopes or on sideslopes above drains.  Rader soils have a fine-loamy control section, and are slightly higher in the landscape on mounded areas.  Tabor soils have A horizons more than 10 inches thick and have chroma of more than 2 in the Bt horizon and are slightly higher in the landscape.  Rader and Tabor soils are also mapped in a complex mapping unit with Lufkin soils.  Rader or Tabor are on low mounds with Lufkin soils in the intermound areas."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is low on 0 to 1 percent slopes and medium on 1 to 3 percent slopes.  Very slow internal drainage.  This soil is seasonally wet and is saturated in the surface layer and upper part of the Bt horizon during the winter and spring seasons for periods of 14 to 30 days during most years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly cultivated in the past but now most areas are in unimproved pastures.  Some areas are farmed to grain sorghums, hay crops or small grains for grazing.  Other areas are in mixed bermudagrass, dallisgrass, or bahiagrass pastures.  Native vegetation is bluestems, gramas, paspalums and threeawn grasses with sedges, post oak, water oak, willow oak, and elm trees."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Classification change from Udertic Paleustalfs to Oxyaquic Vertic Paleustalfs based on knowledge that these soils are saturated for 2 to 4 weeks in most years.  This period of time is within the definition of saturation for one month or more if rules of rounding are applied, i.e., 2 to 6 weeks saturation is considered inclusive.  The soil would classify in the Epioxyaquic subgroup if provided for by SOIL TAXONOMY.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 8 inches (A and E horizons).\nAlbic horizon - 5 to 8 inches. (E horizon)\nArgillic horizon - 8 to 73 inches. (Bt horizon)\nPale feature - Abrupt textural change.\nVertic feature - Cracks in the upper part of the argillic (8 to 28 inches), few slickensides between 16 and 28 inches, and linear extensibility greater than 6.0 cm.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Data are available in Field and Laboratory Studies of the Lufkin Soils, a Planosol, by G. W. Kunze and H. Oakes, in SSSA Proceedings, Vol. 21, No. 3, May-June, 1957, pages 330-335; Kaufman County, Texas, sampled as Lufkin loam, S87TX-257-001; Brazos County, Texas, sampled as Lufkin loam, S83TX-041-01.\nSoil Interpretation Record: TX0302\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
