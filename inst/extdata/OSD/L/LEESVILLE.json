  "OVERVIEW": "The Leesville series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in gravelly alluvium from serpentine rock sources. Leesville soils are on nearly level to gently sloping alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 59 degrees F.",
