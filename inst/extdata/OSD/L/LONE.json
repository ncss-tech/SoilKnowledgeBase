  "OVERVIEW": "The Lone series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in a loess mantel over lake deposits of sand and gravel derived from limestone, sandstone, shale, tuffs, and siliceous conglomerate with some volcanic ash. Lone soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 225 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
