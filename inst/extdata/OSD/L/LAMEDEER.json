  "OVERVIEW": "The Lamedeer series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from baked sandstone and shale. These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
