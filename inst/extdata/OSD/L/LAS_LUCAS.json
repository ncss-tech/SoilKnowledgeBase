(Bw horizon)\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.\nSeries name after a small village in Bernalillo County, New Mexico.  Soil at type location differs from typical profile for series description by having a light clay texture at 8 to 15 inches and having slightly coarser structure throughout the horizon."
