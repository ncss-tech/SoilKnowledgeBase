  "OVERVIEW": "The Liendre series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly or moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium from sandstone and shale. Liendre soils occur on fan remnants along the baseline of Rocky Mountain foothills as they transition to the Great Plains. Slope ranges from 3 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 420 mm and mean annual soil temperature is about 11.6 degrees C.",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Liendre soils occur on alluvial fan remnants originating at the baseline of the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. These fans are relatively steep, ranging from 3 to 8 percent in slope. Soils on these landforms contain coarse rounded to sub-rounded sandstone fragments (gravels and cobbles) which are evidence of their historical relationship to higher energy flood and stream deposits. The parent materials are derived from mostly sandstones and shales of the Raton, Vermejo, and Trinidad Formations with fragments mostly representing the sandstone but the fines being derived from sediment packages of either or both rock types. These fan remnants descend to, and are dissected by, modern drainageways and streams. The location of these fans, adjacent to the mountain front, causes them to be bracketed on the uphill side by landslide deposits, and on the downslope side by either lower relief fans or plateau interfluves.\nSlope range: from 0 to 3 percent but can be as high as 8 percent along terrace risers.\nMean annual precipitation range: from 381 to 457 mm (15 to 18 in.)\nMean annual soil temperature range: from 9.4 to 14.4 degrees C (49 to 58 degrees F)\nMean annual air temperature range: from 8.3 to 12.8 degrees C (47 to 57 degrees F.)\nThe frost-free season range: from 130 to 175 days\nElevation range: from 1828 to 2133 m (6,000 to 7,000 feet)"

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Principal use is for dryland and irrigated cropland and pasture. This series is correlated to the Loamy Uplands ecosite GX070A01X003. However, due to its position in the landscape (high in elevation and exposed to cold air drainage from the Rocky Mountains), this soil occurs at the cooler end of the ecological range where the lower limit of frost-free days occurs within the LRU. Therefore, expect a higher occurrence of cool season plants such as western wheatgrass and bottlebrush squirreltail, and a corresponding decrease in warm season species, particularly broom snakeweed."
