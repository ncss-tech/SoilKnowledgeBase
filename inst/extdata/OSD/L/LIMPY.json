  "OVERVIEW": "The Limpy series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from welded tuffs and andesite. Limpy soils are on mountain side slopes.  Slopes range from 60 to 100 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 70 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The soil is usually moist but is dry with all parts of the moisture control section for less than 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice.   Rock fragments range from 20 to 35 percent gravel, 40 to 50 percent cobbles, and 0 to 3 percent stones throughout the solum.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.  The umbric epipedon is 12 to 20 inches thick and can include all or part of the Bw horizon.  The particle-size control section contains 10 to 20 percent clay and 60 to 85 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is extremely cobbly loam or extremely cobbly sandy loam."
