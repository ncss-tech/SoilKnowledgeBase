  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 48 to 80 or more inches. Depth to carbonates is 48 or more inches. The solum commonly contains 1 to 10 percent gravel except for the B3 horizon which contains as much as 30 percent. About 70 percent of the gravel is 1/2 inch in diameter and 30 percent 1/2 to 1 inch.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It commonly is sandy loam and less commonly silt loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. The Bt horizon typically is loam but some subhorizons are sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam. The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon averages between 18 and 25 percent clay. Grade of structure ranges from moderate to weak, consistence from friable to firm, and reaction typically is strongly acid but individual horizons range to slightly acid or medium acid.\nThe C horizon is sand and gravelly sand or loam and sandy loam overlying sand and gravelly sand."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Soils in the same family are the Atkinson, Ayr, Burchard, Calmar, Corwin, Cresco, Durand, Foresman, Friesland, Griswold, Hitt, Hochheim, Jasper, Joslin, La Rose, Markesan, Mona, Morrill, Norborne, Pana, Parr, Plattville, Ringwood, Rockton, Rotamer, Schoolcraft, Shelby, Sibleyville, Symerton, Tippecanoe, Velma, Wea, and Winnebago series. Atkinson, Ayr, Burchard, Cresco, Friesland, Joslin, Mona, Ringwood, Shelby, Symerton, and Velma soils contain more clay in the lower part of their solum, in addition, Burchard, Griswold, and Ringwood soils have thinner solum. Calmar, Corwin, Hochheim, La Rose, Markesan, Parr, Rockton, Rotamer and Sibleyville soils have solum thickness of less than 40 inches. Durand, Hitt, Morrill, Pana and Winnebago soils have redder hue in much of their B horizons. Foresman and Jasper soils lack gravel in the lower part of their solum. Norbone soils have mollic epipedons more than 24 inches thick. Plattville soils have bedrock at less than 40 inches. Schoolcraft soils have thinner solum and sand higher in the profile. Tippecanoe soils have a silty layer at the surface. Wea soils are less acid in the lower part of the\nsolum and have a lower sand content in the upper part of the solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Linkville soils typically are on glacial till and outwash plains. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Linkville soils formed in material weathered from 4 to 8 feet of loamy till of late Wisconsinan age which overlies stratified sand and gravel. Mean annual temperature is about 45 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches in the areas of the soils distribution."

The well drained Parr, Riddles, and Elston soils are also associated with Linkville. The Parr soils have a thinner solum and are nearly level to sloping. Riddles soils have light-colored surfaces and are gently sloping to steep. Elston soils have more sand in the solum and are nearly level to gently sloping."
