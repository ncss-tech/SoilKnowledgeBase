    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 8 to 13 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to be 40 to 47 degrees F.  The soil is dry in all parts of the moisture control section from early August through early October.  It is usually moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) is less than 20 percent throughout the profile.  The soil is coarse sandy loam or sandy loam throughout.  Clay content averages 5 to 15 percent.  Gravel content ranges from 5 to 25 percent.  Cobble content ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  The soil is slightly or medium acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has dry colors of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, or 5/4. Moist colors are 7.5YR 3/2; 10YR 3/2, or 3/3.\nThe Bw horizon has dry colors of 7.5YR 5/4, 6/4; 10YR 4/4, 6/2, or 6/4. Moist colors are 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4; 10YR 3/4, or 4/3.  Some pedons have C horizons.\nThe Cr horizon is strongly weathered granitic rock that is easily dug by hand tools but retains the original rock structure.  Root penetration is restricted with only a few extending along joints or fractures."
