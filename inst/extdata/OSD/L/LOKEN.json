  "OVERVIEW": "The Loken series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum derived from limestone and calcareous shales. Loken soils are on upland fans and mountain slopes. Slopes are 2 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
