Loken soils formed in clayey alluvium and residuum derived from lime- stone and calcareous shale. The climate is cool with long cold winters and moist springs and summers. Mean annual temperature is 40 to 43 degrees F. Average annual precipitation is 19 to 24 inches, most of which falls during spring and early summer. The growing season is 90 to 110 days."
