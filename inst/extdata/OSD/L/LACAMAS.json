  "OVERVIEW": "The Lacamas series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in mixed alluvium weathered from glacial and sedimentary sources.  Lacamas soils are on glacial terraces and footslopes and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 55 inches and average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
