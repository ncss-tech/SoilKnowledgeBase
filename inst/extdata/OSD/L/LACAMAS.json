  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 45 to more than 60 inches thick.   Average annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 53 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is 45 to 60 percent clay.  Rock fragments are less than 2 percent.  Up to 10 percent iron-manganese concretions occur in the A horizon of some pedons.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and has moderate granular or subangular blocky structure.  It is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry and is mottled dark brown to yellowish red.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  This horizon is 6 to 16 inches thick and has moderate or subangular blocky structure.  The E portion of the B/E horizon occupies 20 to 45 percent of the volume.  It is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 5Y to 10YR, value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 0 through 2 moist or dry and is mottled olive brown, dark brown, or yellowish red.  It is silty clay or clay and is modified with rock fragments below a depth of 48 inches in some pedons.  This horizon has moderate or strong prismatic structure that parts to moderate or strong subangular or angular blocky.  It is extremely acid to moderately acid in the upper part and slightly acid to strongly acid in the lower part.\nThe C horizon, when present, has the same matrix and mottle colors as the Btg horizon.  It is clay, clay loam, or silty clay and is not gravelly in some pedons."
