  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Landermeyer soils occur on floodplains adjacent to areas of deep stream channel entrenchment or are on entrenched narrow mountain drainageways. They formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks and influenced by vitric pyroclastic materials (glassy volcanic ash). Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,432 to 1,964 meters. The climate is cool-semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
