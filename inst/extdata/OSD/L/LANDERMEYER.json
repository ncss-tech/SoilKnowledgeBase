  "OVERVIEW": "The Landermeyer series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks influenced by vitric pyroclastic materials. Landermeyer soils are on entrenched floodplains and narrow mountain drainageways. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
