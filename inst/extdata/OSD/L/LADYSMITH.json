    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are;\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 23 to 73 centimeters (9 to 29 inches) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nMollic epipedon: the zone from 0 to 91 centimeters (0 to 36 inches) (A, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon: the zone from 23 to 91 centimeters (9 inches to 36 inches) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizon).\nKeys to Taxonomy: Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nReading the original soil surveys, it looks like Ladysmith was set up for the interfluves in these areas, but it was also mapped on the benches/paleoterraces below these areas too.  Deanne Presley's Doctorate at KSU \"Genesis and Spatial Distribution of Upland Soils in East Central Kansas\" looked at this and it did not find any correlation between the different landforms and soil properties except for the solum was thicker on the bench/paleoterraces areas.  We should do more field checking into this with sampling, amoozemeter studies, and water loggers to see if the areas show any differences.\n07/2003 Corrected a few typographical errors and added additional data.\n05/2011 changed Taxonomy from udertic to pachic udertic due to changes in Taxonomy. JCW\n1/2012 JGA Updated intro paragraph. Switched metric and English measurements. In the range of characteristics, added soil moisture, soil temperature, particle size clay and sand content, secondary carbonate, argillic horizon, added sand and clay content to the horizon data. Updated competing series section. Changed geographic setting to semi-tab format. Added precipitation pattern. Updated geographically associated soils. Change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity. Added seasonal high water table that is discussed in the soil surveys and populated in NASIS. Updated distribution and extent section. Added Particle size control section to remarks. Added keys to taxonomy edition.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nKansas State University Soil Characterization Laboratory samples 2503-2508 (pedon 88KS061179).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
