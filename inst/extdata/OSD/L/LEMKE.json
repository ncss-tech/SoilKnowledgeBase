    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lemke soils are on fan remnants.  They formed in glaciofluvial deposits with an influence of ash in the surface horizons.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  Elevation is 1,370 to 1,525 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches (350 to 500 millimeters), and the mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C.  The frost free period is 30 to 80 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Fopiano, Gerow, Herberger (T), Laycock, Luckycreek, Pothole (T), Prag, Rastus, Silvies, Skullgulch, Southworth (T), and Sylvaille (T).  All of these soils lack an 'O' horizon except for Laycock and Southworth soils.  Fopiano and Prag soils are found on sideslopes of fan remnants.  Fopiano soils are shallow to a paralithic contact whereas Prag is moderately deep.  Gerow and Silvies soils are located on broad floodplains.  Gerow and Silvies soils have redoximorphic concentrations within 76 centimeters of the soil surface.  Herberger and Sylvaille soils are on outwash plains and fan remnants and lack an \"O\" horizon.  Furthermore, they lack sufficient thickness of ash to qualify as a vitrandic layer.  Laycock and Southworth soils are on hills, have an \"O\" horizon, and are shallow and moderately deep to shale bedrock, respectively.  Luckycreek soils are on broad terraces, are fine-loamy, and very deep to any bedrock.  Pothole soils occur as bowl-shaped depressions on fan remnants and are in the \"fine-loamy over clayey\" family.  Rastus soils are moderately deep to a duripan and are located on fan remnants with Herberger soils.  Skullgulch soils are in small swales of fan remnants and lack any root restrictive layer and are in the fine family."
