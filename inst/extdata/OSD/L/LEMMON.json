  "OVERVIEW": "The Lemmon series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed on hills and mountains.  They formed from alluvium and colluvium dominantly derived from schist.  Slope is 15 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
