  "OVERVIEW": "The Lamson series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in glacio-fluvial, glacio-lacustrine and deltaic deposits. They are level and nearly level soils in low areas on glacial lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent but is mostly less than 2 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high through high in the mineral soil. Mean annual air temperature is 49 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 50 inches. Depth to carbonates ranges from 24 to 60 inches. Rock fragments are commonly absent, but subhorizons in some pedons have up to 15 percent pebbles. The soil ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the upper part of the solum, and from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum.\nAp and A horizons, when present, have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 3. They are fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, and occasionally with mucky analogues. Consistence is very friable or friable. Combined thickness of A horizons is up to 12 inches. Some pedons have O horizons up to 7 inches.\nThe E horizon, when present, has hue 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 through 4. It ranges from very fine sandy loam to loamy fine sand. Structure is weak granular, subangular blocky, or platy, or it is single grain. Consistence is friable, very friable, or loose. Redoximorphic features are present.\nSome pedons have a BE or BA horizon.\nThe B horizons have hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4. They are dominantly very fine sand, loamy fine sand, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam with heavier and lighter textures in subhorizons covering the extreme range from fine sand to sandy clay loam and silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, subangular blocky, platy or coarse prismatic structure, or the material is loose, single grain or is massive. Consistence is friable or very friable. There are many redoximorphic features.\nThe BC horizon, if present, is similar in color and texture to Bw horizons. They are massive or single grain, or have platy structure. Consistence is friable or firm. It may contain free carbonates.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 4. Textures of the varved material range widely in thin layers from very fine sand to silt clay loam. Some pedons have chroma of 6 in the less dominant portion of variegated material. The material is massive or single grain within individual layers. Consistence is very friable to firm.\nSome pedons have a 2C horizon."

Holton soils do not have carbonates in the series control section. Massena soils lack stratified material in the lower part of the series control section. Newstead soils have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.\nThe Canandaigua, Cheektowaga, Granby, Minoa, Scarboro, and Wareham series are similar soils in related families. Canandaigua soils have a fine-silty particle-size control section. Cheektowaga and Granby soils have a mollic epipedon. Minoa soils have an udic moisture regime. Scarboro soils have a histic epipedon. Wareham soils have a sandy particle-size control section."

Amboy, Canandaigua, Collamer, Dunkirk, Raynham, Wallington, and Williamson soils formed in water-sorted materials having a high silt content. Arkport, Galen, and Minoa soils are better drained soils that formed in similar deposits to those of Lamson soils. Colonie, Elnora, Granby, Junius, and Oakville soils formed in water-sorted materials higher in sand content than Lamson soils."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Placement in an Aeric subgroup is not indicative of the degree of wetness. Seasonal fluctuation of water table and high sand content impart lighter colors than is usually found in soils as wet as these soils. The separation of with the Holton series was worked out with MO-11 and will be reflected in the Holton series when updated.\nDiagnostic horizon and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n(1) Ochric Epipedon - the zone from the surface to 9 inches (Ap horizon).\n(2) Albic horizon - the zone from 9 to 15 inches (Eg horizon).\n(3) Cambic horizon - the zone from 15 to 40 inches (Bw and Bg horizons).\n(4) Aquic moisture Regime - as evidenced by mottles immediately below the surface layer (Eg horizon) and low chroma matrix within 20 inches of the soil surface (Eg horizon).\n(5) Aeric subgroup - as evidence by the horizon at 15 to 22 inches that has a high chroma matrix (Bw horizon)."
