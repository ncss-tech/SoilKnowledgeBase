These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice in 7 years out of 10. Solum depth and depth to the 2C horizon is 12 to 40 inches. The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.15 to 1.35 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples. Clay content in the particle-size control section is 10 to 18 percent. Rock fragments are 0 to 5 percent. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick.\nThe A or Ap horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4, moist or dry. It has 0 to 5 percent gravel. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4, moist or dry. It has 0 to 5 percent gravel. The 2C horizon is coarsely laminated and has a stone line at the contact with the Bw horizon in some pedons. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Lakesol soils formed in mixed loess and volcanic ash over lacustrine sediments. Summers are warm and dry, winters are cold and moist. The average July temperature is about 66 degrees F. and the average January temperature is about 26 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 23 inches. The frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."

Bernhill soils are fine-loamy, do not have  a mollic epipedon, and are on convex footslopes and backslopes of mountains and foothills. Cedonia, Clayton, and Laketon soils do not have  a mollic epipedon. In addition, Cedonia and Laketon soils are fine-silty and are on lake terraces.  Clayton soils are coarse loamy and are on terraces.  Dearyton soils are in a fine family, have an argillic horizon and are on foothills and uplands. Hunters soils are fine-silty, have soft powdery lime in the lower part of the particle-size control section and are on terraces. Springdale soils are sandy-skeletal, do not have a mollic epipedon, and are on terraces."

These soils need laboratory data to confirm this classification.\nThe 11/02 description reflected a change in classification from coarse-silty, mixed, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerolls to coarse-silty, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerolls.\nThe Lakesol series is no longer being mapped in Spokane County and this description reflects a change in the type location from Spokane County to the Colville Indian Reservation.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
