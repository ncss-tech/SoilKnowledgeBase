These soils formed in laminated Latah formation, glaciolacustrine deposits, and complex landslide deposits mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. The climate is temperate continental with dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 45 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."

Spokane soils are coarse-loamy, have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches and are on foothills, mountains and ridgetops. Kramerhill soils are fine-loamy, 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact, and are on convex footslopes and backslopes of mountains and foothills. Uhlig soils are coarse-loamy, very deep, and are on outwash terraces."
