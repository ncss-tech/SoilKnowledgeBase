These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F. The particle-size control section has 0 to 5 percent gravel. The soil is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry. An Ap horizon may be present where the soil is cultivated.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is ashy very fine sandy loam or ashy silt loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.

These soils formed in lake sediments with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess. The climate is temperate continental with dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 26 inches.  The average January temperature is 24 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 66 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
