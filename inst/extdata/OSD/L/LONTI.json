  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Mags (CO), Padilla (AZ), Servilleta (NM), Silver (NM), and Tobish (UT) series.  Chafin soils have less than 5 percent rock fragments and are effervescent throughout the profile.  Mags, Padilla and Silver soils have secondary carbonates in the argillic horizon.  The Silver series attempts to reflect the effects of soil forming agents unique to the Great Plains. Servilleta and Tobish soils have bedrock at moderate depths."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lonti soils are on nearly level plains to steep alluvial fans.  The soils are formed in old gravelly alluvium from granite, schist, sandstone, limestone, shale and basaltic materials.  These soils are at elevations of 4,000 to 5,500 feet in a continental climate with an annual precipitation of 12 to 20 inches.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 52 degrees to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 200 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Abra, Cordes, Lynx, Pastura and Wineg soils and the competing Balon and Poley soils.  Abra, Lynx and Cordes soils lack fine-textured argillic horizons.  Pastura soils are shallow to an indurated calcic horizon.  Wineg soils have a moderately fine-textured control section and a mollic epipedon."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.   Small areas are irrigated. Vegetation is oakbrush, deerbrush and squaw bush with an understory of grama grasses, muhly grasses and squirreltail.  At higher elevations some pinon pine and juniper occur.  At lower elevations the grasses are dominant and include tobosa grass in addition to those mentioned above."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 2 to 45 inches (Bt horizons)\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nThe mean annual precipitation of 12 to 20\" p.z. described in the GEOGRAPHIC SETTING section crosses two moisture regimes - Ustic aridic and Aridic ustic. The soil mapped in the Aridic ustic moisture regime (16 to 20\" p.z.) would classify as Aridic Haplustalfs. When Western Yavapai County Area, Yavapai County, Arizona soil survey is updated, this series should be evaluated to decide which moisture regime is typical.\nUpdate and revisions for the competing series section  2/08  DWD\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
