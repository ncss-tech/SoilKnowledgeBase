  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum is typically 36 to 54 inches and ranges from 27 to 66 inches.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 25 to 54 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is most commonly loam or fine sandy loam, ranging to include sandy loam, loamy sand, and loamy fine sand.  It ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is typically loam or silt loam and less commonly clay loam and silty clay loam, averaging between 20 and 32 percent clay.   Thin dark coatings are common on the faces of peds.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe BC and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  These horizons are typically loam or silt loam ranging to include clay loam and silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  Fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or fine sand is below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Lancaster, Leisy, and Wells series.  Similar soils are the Bazile, Blendon, Geary, Keya, Moody, Nora, Ortello, Paka, Ree, and Trent soils.  Lancaster soils formed in residuum weathered from sandstone and sandy shales.  Leisy soils typically have more clay in the Bt horizon and are deeper to free carbonates.  Wells soils formed in residuum from reddish sandstones and sandy shale. Bazile soils have a 2C horizon of sand at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Blendon and Ortello soils are coarse-loamy.  Geary soils are fine-silty and formed in material of the Loveland formation.  Keya soils have a thicker mollic epipedon.  Moody, Nora, and Trent soils are fine-silty and lack an argillic horizon.  Paka soils formed from siltstone.  Ree soils are in a moister climate."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Loretto soils are nearly level to strongly sloping.   They are on uplands and stream terraces, generally in transition areas between loess deposits and sandhills.  They occur mainly where loess has been covered with loamy eolian material of variable thickness.  Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent.  The range of mean annual temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F, and the range of mean annual precipitation is 22 to 28 inches."
