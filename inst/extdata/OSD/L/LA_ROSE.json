  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: La Rose soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep morainic areas and dissected Wisconsin till plains. Slope gradients range from 2 to 18 percent. These soils formed in calcareous loam or silt loam till thought to be of Wisconsin age. As much as 25 cm (10 inches) of loess or other silty deposits are on the surface of some pedons. Clay mineralogy of the till predominantly is illitic. The mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 12.2 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 991 mm (32 to 39 inches), frost free period ranges from 150 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 207 to 311 meters (680 to 1,020 feet) above mean sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Catlin, Corwin, Flanagan, Hennepin, Octagon, Strawn, and Wyanet soils. The moderately well drained Catlin soils and the somewhat poorly drained Flanagan soils have thicker sola and a thicker mantle of loess, and are on nearby higher-lying or less sloping positions on the till plain. The moderately well drained Corwin and Wyanet soils have thicker sola and are on similar or higher-lying landform positions. Hennepin soils are on similar or steeper slopes nearby and do not have a mollic epipedon or an argillic horizon. Octagon soils do not have a mollic epipedon, have a thicker solum, and are on similar or slightly higher-lying landform positions typically closer to the major streams. Strawn soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are on similar slopes nearby and closer to major streams."

Permeability is moderate in the solum and slow to moderately slow in the substratum."
