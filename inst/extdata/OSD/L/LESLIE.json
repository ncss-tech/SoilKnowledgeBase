    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The particle size control section averages between 35 and 45 percent clay; some subhorizons have as much as 48 percent.  Maximum clay content is more than 40 percent in at least one subhorizon.  Sand content averages less than 5 percent.\nThe Ap or A horizon has value of 2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2. The E horizon has value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. Reaction is neutral to strongly acid.\nThe Bt or B/A horizon has color value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 to 4. It is silt loam or silty clay loam and moderately or strongly acid.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 6.  Color of the BCg horizon is similar to the Btg horizon and it is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Leslie soils are on ridgetops and side slopes of hills on uplands.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 9 percent and the stronger slopes are mostly concave or plane. The soils formed in 5 to 10 feet of loess. The mean annual temperature ranges from 51 to 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 40 inches."

The type location is changed from Lincoln to Lafayette County, Missouri. The profile in Lafayette County is less acid in the lower Btg and BCg from that described in Lincoln County.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
