  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 80 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid unless the soil has been limed. Rock fragment content ranges up to 35 percent in the upper 40 inches of the soil, and ranges up to 60 percent below 40 inches.  Rock fragment content and size usually increase with depth.  However, rock fragments of any size may be in any horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Where the value and chroma are both 3 or less the horizon is less than 6 inches thick.  The A horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or their gravelly, cobbly, channery, or flaggy analogues.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It has the same textures as the A horizon.\nThe BE horizon. where Present, has color similar to the Bt horizon. The BE horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or their gravelly, cobbly channery, or flaggy analogues.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  The Bt horizon to depths of 40 inches or more, is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or their gravelly, cobbly, channery, or flaggy analogues.  Below 40 inches it may range to include the very cobbly or very flaggy analogues of these textures.  It also may contain fragments of stone or boulder size.\nThe C horizon, where present, is typically loamy colluvial material that is variable in color.  Coarse fragments of quartzite, phyllite, metasandstone, or other metasedimentary rocks range from 15 to 60 percent.  Fragments range from gravel and channer to boulder size."

Bailegap, Brevard, Gunstock, Jefferson and Nolichucky are in closely related families.  Allegheny, Chilmark, Clymer, Edgemont, Edneytown, Elsinboro, Gilpin, Glenelg, Matapeake, Meadowville, Pineville, Quakertown, Shelocta, Tate, Thurmont have colors yellower than 7.5YR in all or part of the B horizon.  Allenwood, Arcola, Aura, Chetwynd and Chilmark soils formed in materials deposited by glacial activity.  Bedington, Bucks, Butano, Frankstown, Gilpin, Leck Kill, Nixon, Rayne, Shelocta, Ungers and Whiteford soils are dominated with shale rock fragments.  Additionally Allenwood, Arcola, Birdsboro, Bucks, Chester, Leck Kill, Matapeake, Quakertown, Shelocta, Shouns, Syenite, and Whiteford soils have silt loam or silty clay loam textures in some or all horizons.\nArendtsville, Brasstown, Bucks, Clymer, Cowee, Edgemont, Edneytown, Elsinboro, Eubanks, Gilpin, Glenelg, Junaluska, Leck Kill, Syenite and Whiteford soils have sola less than 40 inches thick or have bedrock shallower than 80 inches.  Collington and Freehold soils contain glauconite.  Murrill soils are dominated with limestone rock fragments.  Bailegap, Gunstock, Jefferson, and Nolichucky soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Brevard soils have oxidic mineralogy and were derived primarily from mountains with gneiss and schist geology."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lonon soils are on colluvial fans, footslopes, benches, and in coves in the Southern Appalachian Mountains.  Slopes are commonly 6 to 30 percent, but range from 2 to 50 percent. Elevation ranges from about 1200 to 3800 feet.  The soil formed colluvial material weathered from metasedimentary rocks such as quartzite, phyllite and metasandstone.  Mean annual temperature near the type location is 56 F.  and mean annual precipitation is 43 inches."

Brasstown, Cataska, Junaluska, Soco, Stecoah, and Sylco soils are on mountain ridgetops and side slopes above Lonon soils.  Cataska and Sylco are in a loamy-skeletal family.  Soco and Stecoah are in coarse-loamy family.  Spivey and Northcove soils are in colluvial positions and are in a loamy-skeletal family."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This series was formerly included in the Brevard and Tate series.  Lonon formed in areas with metasedimentary geology and contains fragments of quartzite, metasandstone, and phyllite.  Brevard and Tate soils formed in areas with geology dominated by granite, gneiss, and schist and contain fragments of those rocks.\nDiagnostic horizons and feature recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 8 inches.\nArgillic horizon - the zone from about 12 to 80 inches below the surface.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
