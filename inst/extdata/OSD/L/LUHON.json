  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 63 to 66 degrees F.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 10 inches.  Depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 5 to 35 inches. The soil above the calcic horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline, but subhorizons of the calcic horizon are very strongly alkaline in some pedons.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent and conductivity ranges from 0 to 14 millimhos above the calcic horizon.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent and are dominantly 1 to 10 inches in diameter.  Some pedons have very cobbly sandy loam, sandy loam, or gravelly sandy loam below depths of 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Where the value is 5 dry and 3 moist, the horizon is less than 5 inches thick.\nThe Bk or C horizons have hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Textures are loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, and gravelly or cobbly loam.  Below 30 inches some pedons have sandy loams with gravelly modifiers."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

The soils formed in calcareous alluvium from soft sedimentary rock or igneous rocks.  The average annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches with nearly uniform amounts received throughout the year but with peak periods occurring from August through October.  Elevations range up to 9,000 feet in southern Colorado and 6,300 feet in the northern part.  Mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F, and mean summer temperature is 62 to 66 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 45 to 90 days."
