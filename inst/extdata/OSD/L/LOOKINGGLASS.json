The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 80 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 24 inches thick.  Depth to the clayey argillic horizon is 12 to 30 inches.  The soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Ap and A horizons have value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, and 0 to 20 percent stones.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  A stone line is at the lower boundary in some pedons. It is silt loam or silty clay loam with 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Few to common black redoximorphic concretions occur in some pedons.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay and averages 35 to 50 percent clay.   It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.\nThe 2C horizon, when present, is similar in color to the 2Bt horizon. It is silty clay loam or cobbly silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay. It has 0 to 25 percent cobbles and 0 to 15 percent gravel."

Soils with the similar xeric argialbolls classification are the Chicane, Kooskia, Nez Perce and Shebang series.  Chicane and Kooskia soils have bisequa profiles. Nez Perce and Shebang soils have secondary lime at a depth of 20 to 30 inches."

The soils formed in loess and volcanic ash overlying older fine textured residuum or colluvium weathered from basalt.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 17 to 30 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."
