  "OVERVIEW": "The Lookingglass series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loess and some volcanic ash overlying older fine textured residuum or colluvium weathered from basalt.  Lookingglass soils are on plateaus, hills, and mountains.   Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

A stone line is at the lower boundary in some pedons. It is silt loam or silty clay loam with 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Few to common black redoximorphic concretions occur in some pedons.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay and averages 35 to 50 percent clay.
