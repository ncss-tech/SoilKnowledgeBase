  "OVERVIEW": "The Lacrol series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in mixed lacustrine sediments.  Lacrol soils are on foothills and mountain sideslopes, and have slopes of 15 to 35 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
