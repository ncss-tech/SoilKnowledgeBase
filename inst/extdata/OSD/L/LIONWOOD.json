  "OVERVIEW": "The Lionwood series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on lake plains and terraces in valleys. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
