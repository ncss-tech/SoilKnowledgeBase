Antrobus soils lack an O horizon and are calcareous throughout.  Basinpeak soils lack an O horizon  and a MAST of 43 to 47 degrees F and MSST of 54 to 59 degrees F.  Broad Canyon soils have a very gravelly loamy sand 2C horizon of 24 to 40 inches.  Decram, Foxmount, Grafen, Krackle, Middlehill, Parachute, Rockabin, Supervisor, and Surdal soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Fairydell and Farlow soils have a calcic horizon.  Gaia soils lack an O horizon and a MAST of 41 to 43 degrees F and MSST of 54 to 59 degrees F.  Greyback soils have carbonates at depths of 5 to 16 inches.  Handran soils lakc an O horizon and a cambic horizon.  Kamack soils have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches and a MAST of 42 to 45 degrees F and MSST of 56 to 58 degrees F.  Klug soils lack an O horizon.  Maurice soils have an ustic soil moisture regime.  Midelight soils have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches and rock fragments are channers.  Midfork soils have calcareous material of 4 to 15 inches.
