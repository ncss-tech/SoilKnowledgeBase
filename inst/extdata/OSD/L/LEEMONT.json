  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 80 inches.  Gilgai relief, in virgin areas, consists of a series of microhighs and microlows about 5 to 16 feet wide.  Clay content ranges from 40 to 60 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or is neutral (N).  A horizons that have moist color values of less than 3.5, are less than 12 inches thick in more than half of any pedon.  Texture is clay.  The A horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizons has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Calcium carbonate concretions in the Bk horizon range from few to common.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.\nA C horizon occurs in some pedons.  Where present, it consists of weathered, and interbedded claystone with clay texture.  Colors of this material are similar to the BC horizon with mottles that are lithochromic."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Similar soils include the Montell series and the similar Harlingen, Mercedes, Montell, Monteola, and Victoria series.  The Harlingen soils have chroma of 2 or more.  Mercedes soils have mean annual soil temperatures of more than 74 degrees F. and contain more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium within 30 inches of the surface.  Monteola and Victoria soils have A horizons more than 12 inches thick with color values less than 5.5 dry and 2.5 moist.  Montell soils contain more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium within 30 inches of the surface and occur in drier regions."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 33 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 70 to 74\ndegrees F. and Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 36 to 46."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include Monteola soils of the competing series as well as Denhawken, Elmendorf, Sarnosa and Shiner soils.  Denhawken, Elmendorf and Sarnosa soils lack intersecting slickensides.  In addition, Elmendorf soils have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons.  Sarnosa soils have coarse-loamy control sections.  Shiner soils have weakly\ncemented sandstone within 20 inches of the surface."
