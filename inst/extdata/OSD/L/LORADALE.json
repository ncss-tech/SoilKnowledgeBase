  "OVERVIEW": "The Loradale series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in old alluvium residuum from limestone and thin layers of calcareous shale.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Average annual precipitation is 46 inches.  Average annual temperature is 56 degrees F.",
