  "OVERVIEW": "The Locane series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from shale, tuffaceous or siliceous conglomerate and volcanic rock.  The Locane soils are on side slopes and summits of mountains, hills and plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
