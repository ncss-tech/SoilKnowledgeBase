These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from shale and tuffaceous or siliceous conglomerate and volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,710 to 2,440 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool moist winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 350 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 50 to 80 days."
