  "OVERVIEW": "The Ladderlake series consists of very deep, poorly or very poorly drained soils formed in organic material over alluvium and/or till derived from granitic rocks. The Ladderlake soils are on flood-plain steps on glacial valley floors and cirque floors of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 865 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.",
