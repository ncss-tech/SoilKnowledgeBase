  "OVERVIEW": "The Lanapohaku series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and `a`a lava. Slopes range from 6 to 50 percent. The mean annual rainfall is about 500 millimeters (20 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).",
