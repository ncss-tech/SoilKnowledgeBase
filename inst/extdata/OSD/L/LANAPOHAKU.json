These soils are on `a`a lava flows that have been covered by sandy volcanic ash. Underlying lava flows are 5,000 to 250,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 6 to 50 percent. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 400 to 1000 millimeters (16 to 40 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1,520 to 1,780 millimeters (60 to 70 inches). The mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 14 degrees C (45 to 57 degrees F). The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
