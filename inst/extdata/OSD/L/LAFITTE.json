  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to mineral layers range from 51 inches to more than 100 inches. The conductivity of the saturation extract varies seasonally and with the salt content of preceding flood waters but averages 4 to 8 dS/m in at least part of the upper or middle tiers during most of the year.\nThe organic materials in the surface tier (0 to 12 inches) have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value 2 to 4, and chroma 1 to 3. Fiber content, after rubbing, ranges from 1 to 35 percent. Reaction of the surface tier ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline and from extremely acid to moderately acid where drained. Some pedons have mineral over-wash layers 2 to 10 inches thick in this tier or have a thin Oe horizon of muck or mucky loam.\nThe organic materials in the subsurface tier (12 to 36 inches) and the bottom tier (36 to 51 inches) have color with hue 7.5YR or 10YR, value 2 or 3, and chroma 1 or 2. Rubbed fiber content averages between 1 to 10 percent of the organic volume. Reaction of the subsurface and bottom tiers is slightly acid to moderately alkaline, and extremely acid to moderately acid where drained. The sodium adsorption ratio is more than 13; the exchangeable sodium percentage is more than 15 and the salinity is moderate or high in some or all layers within these tiers.\nThe Ag and Cg horizons, where present, have hue of 2.5Y to 5BG, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2 or are neutral with value of 4 or 5.  Textures range from sand to clay. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Maurepas, Terra Ceia, Timbalier and the Torry series in the same family. Maurepas soils have redder hues and are less saline. Terra Ceia soils are nonsaline. Timbalier soils are more saline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lafitte soils are in large areas of intermediate to brackish marshes in the extreme lower Mississippi River delta and coastal areas.  They commonly adjoin large brackish water lakes. Elevation is typically one foot above mean sea level to about 3 feet below. Lafitte soils formed in herbaceous plant remains that overlie mineral sediments.  Mean annual precipitation is about 65 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Maurepas and Timbalier series and the Allemands, Gentilly and Kenner series. Allemands soils have mineral layers within 51 inches of the surface. The Gentilly series is a mineral soil. In addition, both of these soils are on the landward side of the Lafitte series and are less saline. Kenner soils have strata of clayey material less than 12 inches thick between depths of 12 and 51 inches."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most area of Lafitte soils are used for wildlife habitat. Some areas are protected by dikes and pumps and are used for urban development. The vegetation is mainly marshhay cordgrass, seashore saltgrass, olney bulrush, coastal water hyssop, saltmarsh bulrush, and seashore paspalum in brackish marsh. In addition, widgeongrass, sawgrass, giant bulrush, alligatorweed, common duckweed, roseau, smartweed, bulltongue, and cattail are found in intermediate marshes."
