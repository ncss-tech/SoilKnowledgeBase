  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are dry for more than three-fourths the time when the soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 4 to 10 inches.  Depth to fractured bedrock ranges from 4 to 10 inches.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 25 percent and are mostly in the A horizon.  Clay in the particle-size control section ranges from 25 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is 27 to 35 percent clay.\nThe B horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is clay loam, loam or sandy clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ladycomb soils are on dissected rock pediments at elevations of 4700 to 5300 feet. Slopes are 8 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium and residuum weathered from igneous rocks. They are underlain by highly fractured andesite and rhyolite.  The climate is characterized by cold dry winters and cool dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
