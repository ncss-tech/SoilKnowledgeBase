  "OVERVIEW": "The Lick series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till or colluvium derived from granite and gneiss. These soils are on moraines and hills. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
