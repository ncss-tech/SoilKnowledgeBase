  "OVERVIEW": "The Lonna series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from semiconsolidated loamy sedimentary beds, and glaciofluvial and glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, sedimentary plains, lake plains, drainageways, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
