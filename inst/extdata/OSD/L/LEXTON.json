    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Ironstone fragments or concretions range from none to about l0 percent throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Where chroma is less than 3.5 moist, the horizon is less than 6 inches thick. The A horizon is clay loam or sandy clay loam. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Hue ranges to 7.5YR in the lower part of the Bt horizon in some pedons. Mottles in shades of brown and yellow range from none to common in the lower part. These colors are inherited from the parent materials. Texture is clay loam or clay with an average clay content of 35 to 55 percent. Reaction of the Bt horizons ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe BCt, or BC horizon, where present, have colors in shades of red, brown, and yellow or is mottled with these colors. Texture is clay loam or clay. Reaction of the BCt or BC horizon is moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon is variable and is mottled in shades of yellow, brown, olive, or black, and ranges from partially weathered glauconitic sandstone and greensand to clay loam or sandy loam materials. Marine shell fossils range from none to common. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline ."

Margie soils have sola between 60 and 80 inches. Jedd and Rosanky soils have fine sandy loam or coarser A horizons, have abrupt boundaries to the Bt horizon, and have base saturation less than 75 percent in all parts of the argillic horizon. In addition, Jedd soils have sola 20 to 40 inches thick. Nacogdoches soils have sola more than 60 inches thick and are moist for longer periods of time."

The soil formed in old marine sediments that contain glauconite. Geology at the type location is the Weches Formation of the Tertiary age. Mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 70 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 40 inches. Frost free days range from 260 to 280 days, and elevation ranges from 280 to 600 feet. Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 52 to 64."

Native vegetation is a savannah of post oak, blackjack oak, and hickory trees with understory of longleaf uniola, little bluestem, Indiangrass, and panicums."
