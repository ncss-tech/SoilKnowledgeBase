  "OVERVIEW": "The Londo series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy till on moraines, till plains, water-lain moraines, and wave-worked till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 860 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Similar series include the Aubarque, Capac, Conover, Crosier, and Shebeon series. Aubarque, Conover, Crosier and Shebeon soils do not have a glossic horizon. Aubarque soils have carbonates within 25 cm of the soil surface and do not have an argillic horizon. Aubarque, Crosier and Shebeon soils have densic materials within the series control section. Capac soils classify as Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Aquic Glossudalfs and are typically deeper to carbonates than Londo soils."
