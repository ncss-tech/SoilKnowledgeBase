  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 2 inches, a cambic horizon with more than 6 percent organic carbon from 2 to 14 inches, and a lithologic change from volcanic ash and pumice to a buried medial soil at 28 inches.  The 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of less than 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of more than 1 percent.  The upper part of the particle-size control section has an estimated 10 to 12 15-bar moisture (dry).  The lower part has an estimated 15-bar moisture (dry) of more than 15 percent.  Vitricryands feature - less than 12 percent.\nClassification changed 6/98 based on revised mineralogy classes in Soil Taxonomy.  After more clarification on use of pararock and rock fragments, the family particle-size class should be confirmed.  Using guidelines from the NSSH, the upper part of the control section would quality as pumiceous or ashy-pumiceous.  The ranges of fragments documented in the R of C corss particle-size class boundaries.  The original concept of this series was ashy rather than ashy-pumiceous.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Partial laboratory data are available for this soil Sample Number R75-108.  Field test of NaF pH is less than 9.2 in the A and 3C, 12 in Bhs, 11.5 in C, and 11.0 in 2Bwb.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
