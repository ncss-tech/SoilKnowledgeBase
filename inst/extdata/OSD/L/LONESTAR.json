    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lonestar soils are on ridgetops and backslopes of mountains at elevations of 2,800 to 4,500 feet.  Slopes range from 5 to 90 percent.  Lonestar soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice over residuum and colluvium from basic igneous rock.  The climate is characterized by cool, moist summers and cold, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 80 to 130 inches including snow cover from November to June.  The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F, the average July temperature is about 53 degrees F, and the average annual temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 75 to 95 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 2 inches, a cambic horizon with more than 6 percent organic carbon from 2 to 14 inches, and a lithologic change from volcanic ash and pumice to a buried medial soil at 28 inches.  The 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of less than 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of more than 1 percent.  The upper part of the particle-size control section has an estimated 10 to 12 15-bar moisture (dry).  The lower part has an estimated 15-bar moisture (dry) of more than 15 percent.  Vitricryands feature - less than 12 percent.\nClassification changed 6/98 based on revised mineralogy classes in Soil Taxonomy.  After more clarification on use of pararock and rock fragments, the family particle-size class should be confirmed.  Using guidelines from the NSSH, the upper part of the control section would quality as pumiceous or ashy-pumiceous.  The ranges of fragments documented in the R of C corss particle-size class boundaries.  The original concept of this series was ashy rather than ashy-pumiceous.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Partial laboratory data are available for this soil Sample Number R75-108.  Field test of NaF pH is less than 9.2 in the A and 3C, 12 in Bhs, 11.5 in C, and 11.0 in 2Bwb.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
