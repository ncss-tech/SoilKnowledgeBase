  "OVERVIEW": "The Lunsford series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in mixed alluvium from sedimentary and extrusive igneous rock.  Lunsford soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
