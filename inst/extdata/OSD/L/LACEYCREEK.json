The potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, rough fescue, Idaho fescue, and Columbia needlegrass.  The moist phase has an overstory of quaking aspen and the potential native understory vegetation is rose, snowberry, Saskatoon serviceberry, Canada wildrye, red raspberry, and sticky geranium.  The cool phase has an overstory of ponderosa pine and Douglas fir and the potential native understory vegetation is pinegrass, common snowberry, white spirea, rose, and kinnikinnick."
