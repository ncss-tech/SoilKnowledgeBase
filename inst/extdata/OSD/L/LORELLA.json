  "OVERVIEW": "The Lorella series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from tuff and basalt.  Lorella soils are on hills, mountains, escarpments and rock benches.  Slopes are 0 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist and are dry at depths between 4 to 12 inches for about 90 to 120 days consecutive days out of the 200 to 240 days when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  They are moist in some part or throughout from about October 10 to June 21.  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  The mollic epipedon may include all of part of the Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 5 to 35 percent gravel and 0 to 50 percent cobbles and stones.  It is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 through 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or clay and averages 35 to 50 percent clay.  The horizon has 5 to 50 percent gravel, 10 to 45 percent cobbles and stones, and 35 to 60 percent total rock fragments.  It is neutral to mildly alkaline."

Laufer soils are dry for 80 to 90 consecutive days.  Longcreek, Loomer Pioche and Ruckles soils have an aridic soil moisture regime.

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from tuff and basalt.  The climate is characterized by dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 18 inches with most of the area above 12 inches.  The mean January temperature is 28 degrees F; the mean July temperature is 67 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 120 days."

Booth, Calimus, Capona, Harriman, Lasere, and Stukel soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments.  Booth soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches, are frigid, and occur near the upper part of the elevational range on adjacent northerly slopes.  Bullump soils are over 40 inches deep to bedrock, are frigid and are on north slopes.  Calimus, Capona, and Dehlinger soils lack argillic horizon and are over 20 inches deep to bedrock.  Harriman soils have a fine-loamy Bt horizons and have soft bedrock at depths of 40 or more inches.  Lasere soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Stukel soils have an average of 10 to 18 percent clay.  Woodcock soils are cryic, underlain by bedrock at depths over 60 inches, and also occur near the upper part of the elevational range on northerly aspects."
