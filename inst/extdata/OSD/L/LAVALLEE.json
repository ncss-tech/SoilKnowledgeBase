    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum ranges from 16 to 30 inches.  Common to numerous gravels mixed throughout the profile.\nThe color of the A horizon includes hues of 10YR and 7.5YR with chromas and values of 2 or 3.  Texture is dominantly gravelly clay loam, but clay loams and loams are within the range of the series.\nThe Bt horizon ranges in texture from gravelly loam, clay loam to gravelly clay with gravelly clay loam being the most common and in structure from weak to moderate subangular blocky with few faint to common distinct clay films.  Sediments below the Bt horizons consist of stratified lenses of gravelly loam, gravelly clay loam, loam and gravels with thin lenses or pockets of secondary lime.\nBC horizons have coated sand grains and none to very few faint clay films."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the San Anton, Glynn, Parasol and Machete series.  The San Anton soils lack an argillic horizon and are not as gravelly in the B horizon.  The Glynn soils have finer textured profiles, thicker sola and more strongly developed subsoils.  The Parasol soils are less gravelly, yellower (10YR hues) and have thicker sola (20 to 30 inches).  The Machete soils have redder profiles (5YR hues) are less gravelly in the argillic horizon and more acid throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Lavallee soils occur on gently sloping alluvial fans where sediments from the volcanic uplands have been deposited on the coastal plains with slope gradients of 2 to 5 percent. The regolith consists of gravelly moderate to moderately fine texture sediments.  The climate is semiarid.  Rainfall ranges from 40 to 45 inches and the annual temperature from 78 to 80 degrees F."

Soil Taxonomy presently has a definition of Udic-ustic soil moisture regimes that are mutually exclusive.
