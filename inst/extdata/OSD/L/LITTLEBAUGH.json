  "OVERVIEW": "The Littlebaugh series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from granite. The Littlebaugh soils are on structural benches, glacial-valley walls, and mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1070 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
