  "OVERVIEW": "The Langellain series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils on ridges, knolls, and hillslopes.  They formed in colluvium and alluvium from sedimentary rock.  Slopes are 1 to 40 percent.  They mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

The soil is 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Thickness of the solum above the nonconforming 2Bt horizon ranges from 12 to 28 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 56 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 20 to 35 percent clay in the upper part and 45 to 60 percent in the lower part.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 moist and 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It has 1 to 3 percent organic matter.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist and 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 1 through 6 moist and dry.  It is loam or clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 10YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 4 through 8 dry, and chroma of 1 through 6 moist and dry.  It has faint to prominent mottles.  It has 45 to 60 percent clay."
