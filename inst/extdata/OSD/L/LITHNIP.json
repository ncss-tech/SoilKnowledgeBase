  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lithnip soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.   Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 8,000 to 12,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches, mean annual temperature is 36 to 39 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 15 to 60 days."

Florand soils are deep to paralithic contacts and have umbric epipedons and cambic horizons.  Hawkinspeak soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts and have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons.  Lostridge soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts and have umbric epipedons and cambic horizons."
