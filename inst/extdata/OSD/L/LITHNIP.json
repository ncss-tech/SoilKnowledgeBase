  "OVERVIEW": "The Lithnip series consists of very shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Lithnip soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",

They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.   Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 8,000 to 12,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches, mean annual temperature is 36 to 39 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 15 to 60 days."
