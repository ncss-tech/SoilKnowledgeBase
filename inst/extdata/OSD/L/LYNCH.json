  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum typically is 17 to 35 inches thick, and the depth to soft, partially weathered shale is 20 to 40 inches.  In addition to the lime, the parent material and shale contains 30 to 40 percent gypsum in seams and pockets.  It is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Silty clay is the dominant texture of the A horizon, but due to the gypsum, the soil feels coarser textured.  In some pedons the A horizon is lacking.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7 and 3 through 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  The B horizon is clay or silty clay.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 through 8 and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma to 2 through 6.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 through 8 and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1through 4."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEORGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEORGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Lynch soils are on gently sloping to steep uplands.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  They formed in clay residuum weathered from calcareous and gypsiferous, light colored, soft shales.  The average annual precipitation ranges from about 20 to 24 inches.  The average annual air temperature ranges from about 47 to 52 degrees F."

Bristow and Sansarc soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock and occur above Lynch.  Verdel soils have vertic characteristics and are on terrace positions."
