The buried horizons do not contribute to the thickness of the mollic.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 9 inches (A horizon)\nCalcic horizon - the zone from 9 to 27 inches (Bk and Bkg1 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the Bk, the Bkg1, the Bkg2, and part of the Bkg3 horizons)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
