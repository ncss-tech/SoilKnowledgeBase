  "OVERVIEW": "The Lago series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in silty alluvium. They are on flood plains, drainageways, and floodplain steps. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Permeability is moderately slow. Average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
