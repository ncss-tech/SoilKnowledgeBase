  "OVERVIEW": "The Loki series consists of very deep, well drained, moderate permeable soils formed in gypsiferous lacustrine deposits. These nearly level soils are on relict lakebeds and alluvial flats on basin floors. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
