  "OVERVIEW": "The Labenzo series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  These soils are on river terraces and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very rapid below.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
