  "OVERVIEW": "The Laurentzen series consists of deep and very deep, well drained\nsoils that formed in alluvium.  Laurentzen soils are on fan terraces or\nbasalt plains and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  Permeability is\nmoderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches,\nand the average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
