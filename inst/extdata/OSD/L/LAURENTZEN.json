The soils have warm dry\nsummers and cold moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 12\nto 16 inches, most of which comes as early spring rain and winter\nsnow.  The average annual air temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F.  The\nfrost-free period is 60 to 100 days."

Manard soils have a clayey control section.\nPolecreek are clayey-skeletal and Magic soils are clayey throughout.\nGaib soils are on foothills and mountainsides.  Harahill, Manard,\nPolecreek, and Magic are on similar landscapes as the Laurentzen soil."
