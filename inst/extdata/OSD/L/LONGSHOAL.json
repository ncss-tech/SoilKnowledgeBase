  "OVERVIEW": "The Longshoal series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils with moderately rapid permeability.  These soils formed in thick herbaceous plant remains over marine and fluvial sediments.  They are in brackish coastal marshes of the Lower Coastal Plain.  Slope is less than 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 53 inches and mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F. near the type location.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the underlying material and depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Depth to mineral layers is more than 51 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately alkaline.  Upon drying reaction is slightly lower.  Sodium Absorption Ratio (SAR) is more than 13.  Longshoal soils are strongly saline and electrical conductivity is more than 16 millimhos per centimeter.\nThe organic materials in the surface tier (the Oe or Oa horizon from 0-12 inches) have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is mucky peat or muck.  The fiber content after rubbing is less than about 40 percent.  Some pedons have mineral overwash layers 2 to 10 inches thick.  Some pedons have thin (less than 5 inches thick) layers of fibric material (peat).\nThe organic materials in the subsurface tier (the Oa horizon from 12 to 36 inches) and the bottom tier (from 36 to 51 inches) have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is muck.  The fiber content after rubbing is less than about 15 percent.  Some pedons have thin (less than 5 inches thick) strata of loamy or sandy material.\nThe Ag or Cg horizons, where present, have hue of 5YR to 5BG, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2, or hue of N, value of 2 to 5.  Texture is sandy, loamy, or clayey."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in a mixture of herbaceous plant remains underlain by marine and fluvial sediments.  These soils are subject to wind tides and storm surges.  Elevation typically is at sea level, and is 2 feet or less.  Slope is 1 percent or less.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 70 degrees F., the frost free season ranges from 215 to 250 days, and the average annual precipitation ranges from 46 to 58 inches."
