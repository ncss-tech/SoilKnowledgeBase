    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Loveland, Swope and Woofus series in the same family and the Gibbon, Lamo, Leshara and Alda series in closely related families.  Loveland soils have a higher seasonal water table during the growing season.  Swope and Woofus soils are dry for longer periods in the soil moisture control section. Woofus soils have a higher seasonl high water table and are at elevations above 5,000 feet.  Gibbon, Lamo and Leshara soils are fine-silty and do not have gravelly sand and coarse sand above a depth of 40 inches.  Alda soils are coarse-loamy."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Runoff is low.  Permeability is moderate or moderately slow in the solum and very rapid in the substratum.  The seasonal high water table ranges from 1 to 3 feet.  It is highest during winter and early spring when stream flow is highest.  During midsummer it commonly recedes to 3 to 6 feet.  Flooding is rare or occasional."

Corn, alfalfa, and soybeans are the most common grown crops.  The native vegetation is mainly big bluestem, switchgrass, indiangrass, and little bluestem."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil was formerly correlated as a moderately deep phase of Lamoure soils.  A saline-alkali phase is recognized.  These soils generally are not saturated at depths between 40 and 50 cm during the growing season.  The diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon--the zone from 0 to 18 inches (Ap, A1 and A2 horizon); an irregular decrease in organic carbon content from a depth of 25 cm to a depth of 125 cm; and aquic soil conditions--the zone from 23 to 80 inches (2Cg horizon).\nOSD Modification RRZ 7/2002:  OSD needs to allow chromas of less than 2 in the C and Cg horizons.  Chromas of 3 and 4 in these horizons may fail the Endoaqualls classification of low cxhroma depletions are not present.  Depletions are indicated in the typically profile at this time.
