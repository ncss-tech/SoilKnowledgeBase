  "OVERVIEW": "The Lex series consists of very deep somewhat poorly drained soils on flood plains.  They formed in 20 to 40 inches of loamy alluvium deposited over coarse sand or gravelly sand.  Permeability is moderate or moderately slow in the solum and very rapid in the substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches at the type location.",

Loveland soils have a higher seasonal water table during the growing season.  Swope and Woofus soils are dry for longer periods in the soil moisture control section. Woofus soils have a higher seasonl high water table and are at elevations above 5,000 feet.  Gibbon, Lamo and Leshara soils are fine-silty and do not have gravelly sand and coarse sand above a depth of 40 inches.  Alda soils are coarse-loamy."

The seasonal high water table ranges from 1 to 3 feet.  It is highest during winter and early spring when stream flow is highest.  During midsummer it commonly recedes to 3 to 6 feet.  Flooding is rare or occasional."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil was formerly correlated as a moderately deep phase of Lamoure soils.  A saline-alkali phase is recognized.  These soils generally are not saturated at depths between 40 and 50 cm during the growing season.  The diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon--the zone from 0 to 18 inches (Ap, A1 and A2 horizon); an irregular decrease in organic carbon content from a depth of 25 cm to a depth of 125 cm; and aquic soil conditions--the zone from 23 to 80 inches (2Cg horizon).\nOSD Modification RRZ 7/2002:  OSD needs to allow chromas of less than 2 in the C and Cg horizons.  Chromas of 3 and 4 in these horizons may fail the Endoaqualls classification of low cxhroma depletions are not present.  Depletions are indicated in the typically profile at this time.
