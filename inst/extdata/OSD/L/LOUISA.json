  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to a paralithic contact, ranges from 10 to 20 inches. The underlying saprolite grades into hard rock at depths of 5 to 10 feet or more. Volume fragments of gneiss, quartz and schist ranges from 5 to 25 percent in the solum and 5 to 60 percent in the C horizon. Clay content of the particle size control section, between depths of 10 inches and the paralithic contact ranges from 12 to 30 percent. Reaction ranges from very\nstrongly acid to moderately acid, except surface layers which have been limed. Flakes of mica range from common to many in all horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or their gravelly analogues.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8. It is loam, sandy loam, clay loam, or their gravelly analogues. In each pedon, there is a Bt horizon 3 to 6 inches thick, or pockets of argillic material. It is loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or their gravelly analogues.\nThe C horizon, where present is weathered gneiss and schist saprolite with few to common pockets or lenses of the cambic or argillic horizon tonguing into the upper part. The saprolite breaks down to loam or sandy loam or their gravelly or channery analogues.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered mica schist and gneiss bedrock with varying degrees of hardness."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Series of closely related families are the Chandler, Goldston, Hector, Louisburg, Montevallo, Ramsey, Steekee, Talladega, Tallapoosa, and Wilkes series. Chandler and Talladega soils have mesic temperatures; in addition, Talladega soils have less mica. Goldston, Hector, Ramsey, and Steekee soils have siliceous mineralogy, in addition, Goldston soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section. Hector and Ramsey soils have a lithic contact at less than 20 inches. Louisburg and Montevallo soils have mixed mineralogy. Montevallo soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section. Tallapoosa soils have continuous argillic horizons less than 10 inches thick. Wilkes soils have base saturation of more than 60 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Louisa soils formed in residuum weathered from micaceous gneiss and schist rocks. The climate is warm and humid. The average annual temperature ranges from about 60 to 65 degrees F., average annual precipitation ranges from about 45 to 55 inches."
