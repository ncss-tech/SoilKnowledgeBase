  "OVERVIEW": "The Lookout series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from basalt and volcanic tuff with an influence of loess, volcanic ash and pumice in the surface horizon.  Lookout soils are on hills and have slopes of 0 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the duripan is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock commonly is 40 to 60 inches. These soils are usually dry, but are moist during the winter and spring.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  Organic matter content in the upper 9 inches is 1.5 to 2.5 percent.  Rock fragments range form 5 to 25 percent in the solum and are common as a stone line on the surface of the 2Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 4 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay or silty clay and averages 48 to 60 percent clay.  It increases in clay 15 percent or more within a vertical distance of 1 inch from its upper boundary.  This horizon has moderate or strong prismatic structure parting to strong subangular or angular blocky.\nThe 2Btk horizon is silty clay loam, clay or stony clay. The depth to segregated or disseminated lime is about 15 to 30 inches.\nThe duripan is platy with weakly to strongly cemented soil material between indurated lenses.  It has 10 to 25 percent stones, cobbles and gravel."

Chilcott soils are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock and have less than 5 percent rock fragments in the upper Bt horizon.  Kepler soils have weakly to moderately cemented duripans and have an E horizon below and Ap horizon. Lovejoy soils are slightly to moderately acid above the duripan and have 35 to 45 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Reno soils are noncalcareous in the A and B horizons and have strongly cemented duripans with discontinuous indurated silica laminae."
