  "OVERVIEW": "The Latrass series consists of deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that are reconstructed from clayey materials over landfills. These nearly level to steep soils are mainly on uplands. Slope range is 1 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 928 mm (36.5 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
