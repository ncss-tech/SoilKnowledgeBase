  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Longjim series consists of shallow over duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. The Longjim soils are on fan piedmont remnants. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
