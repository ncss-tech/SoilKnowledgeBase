  "OVERVIEW": "The Louscot series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from acid shale.  These soils are on fans adjacent to sedimentary uplands.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
