  "OVERVIEW": "The Leavers series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium weathered from extrusive igneous rock.  Leavers soils are on alluvial plains and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

Pogue soils have 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the upper part of the particle-size control section, are somewhat excessively drained, have a thinner mollic epipedon and formed in glacial outwash.  Stratford soils are calcareous in the lower part of the control section and are mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  In addition, all these soils do not have mottles in the lower part of the control section."

The lower part of the control section has 3 percent clay and 42 percent pebbles.  Coarse-loamy material has 50 percent fine or coarser sand.\nModerately well drained--Mottles below 75 cm of the surface and December to March has a water table of 42 to 72 inches.  Water table within 72 inches during winter months will effect septic tank interpretation.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
