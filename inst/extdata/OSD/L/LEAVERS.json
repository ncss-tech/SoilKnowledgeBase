The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F from about March 15 to December 1 (255 days) and is above 47 degrees F from about April 15 to November 15 (210 days).  The soil between depths of 8 to 24 inches is dry in all parts from June 15 to November 10 (145 days).  The moisture control section is dry more than half the time the soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F.  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 35 inches.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 5/1, 5/2 and moist color of 10YR 2/1, 3/1, 3/2, 3/3.  Clay content ranges from 8 to 13 percent.  Pebbles range from 0 to 5 percent by volume.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.  Thickness ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 3 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 7/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/3, 4/2, 4/3.  Clay content ranges from 10 to 15 percent with 1 to 2 percent more clay content than the A horizon.  Pebbles range from 5 to 10 percent by volume.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral. Thickness ranges from 8 to 15 inches.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 7/1, 7/2, 7/3 and moist color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2.  Pebbles range from 35 to 60 percent.

Pogue soils have 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the upper part of the particle-size control section, are somewhat excessively drained, have a thinner mollic epipedon and formed in glacial outwash.  Stratford soils are calcareous in the lower part of the control section and are mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  In addition, all these soils do not have mottles in the lower part of the control section."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are: Mollic epipedon--The zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 15 inches (Ap and A2 horizons).\nCambic horizon--The zone from about 15 to 25 inches (Bt).\nCoarse-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal family:  The particle control section (10 to 40 inches) the weighted average of the upper part of the control section has 11 percent clay.  The lower part of the control section has 3 percent clay and 42 percent pebbles.  Coarse-loamy material has 50 percent fine or coarser sand.\nModerately well drained--Mottles below 75 cm of the surface and December to March has a water table of 42 to 72 inches.  Water table within 72 inches during winter months will effect septic tank interpretation.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
