  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 degrees to 47 degrees F. The soils have an aquic moisture regime and are saturated with water throughout the year. Organic materials are primarily from herbaceous plants. Organic matter content of the surface tier ranges from about 35 to 62 percent and is about 62 percent in the subsurface tier as determined by loss on ignition of oven dry samples.  The subsurface tier is medium acid to neutral and the bottom tier is strongly to slightly acid. The control section extends to a depth of 52 inches and dominantly is hemic material. Diatomaceous silt layers are 2 to 4 inches thick and one or more of these layers occur at depths between 12 to 52 inches.\nThe surface tier has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 0 through 2 moist and dry. It has 50 to 90 percent fibers and about 10 to 30 percent when rubbed.\nThe subsurface tier has about 35 to 80 percent fibers and 10 to 40 percent after rubbing.\nThe limnic layer has value of 2 through 4 moist and 5 through 8 dry, and chroma of 0 to 1 moist and dry. These layers are diatomaceous silt.  The bottom tier has about 40 to 95 percent fibers and 20 to 50 percent after rubbing."
