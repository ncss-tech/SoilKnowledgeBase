  "OVERVIEW": "The Loran series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on uplands.  These soils formed in loess, glacial till, and the underlying residuum weathered from clayey shale. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F).",

Bearpen, Harco, and Shannondale soils have less clay in the lower part of the sola and formed in silty sediments on stream terraces. Brenton, Elburn, Grundelein, Lafayette, and Mundelein soils have less clay in the lower part of the sola and have the lower part of the B horizon and the C horizon formed in stratified outwash. Edwardsville, Higginsville, and Muscatine soils have less clay in the lower part of the sola and formed in deep loess. Hacreek soils have less clay in the lower part of the sola and formed in alluvium.  Keller, Lisbon, and Raub soils have less clay and more sand in the lower part of the sola and have the lower part of the B horizon and the C horizon formed in glacial till. Lawndale and Rowley soils contain less clay and more sand in the lower part of the sola and have the lower part of the B horizon and the C horizon formed in sand."

The Keltner soils are moderately well drained or well drained and are downslope from the Loran soils. Calamine soils are poorly drained and are on nearly level or depressional areas, and have a thinner layer of loess. The well drained or moderately well drained Derinda and Eleroy soils lack mollic epipedons, and in addition, the Derinda soils have a thinner layer of loess. They are on similar landscape positions to the Loran soils. Drummer soils are poorly drained and formed in loess and the underlying glacial drift. They are upslope on nearly level positions of the landscape. Ridott soils are poorly drained and have a thinner dark colored surface soil. They are upslope from the Loran soils. Schapville and Shullsburg soils are shallower to the underlying shale than the Loran soils. They are on similar positions on the landscape."
