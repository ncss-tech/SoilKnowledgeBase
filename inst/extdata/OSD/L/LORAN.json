None of these soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches).  In addition: Arrowsmith, Lismod, and Rooks soils have carbonates present within a depth of 64 to 102 cm (25 to 40 inches).  Bearpen, Harco, and Shannondale soils have less clay in the lower part of the sola and formed in silty sediments on stream terraces. Brenton, Elburn, Grundelein, Lafayette, and Mundelein soils have less clay in the lower part of the sola and have the lower part of the B horizon and the C horizon formed in stratified outwash. Edwardsville, Higginsville, and Muscatine soils have less clay in the lower part of the sola and formed in deep loess. Hacreek soils have less clay in the lower part of the sola and formed in alluvium.  Keller, Lisbon, and Raub soils have less clay and more sand in the lower part of the sola and have the lower part of the B horizon and the C horizon formed in glacial till. Lawndale and Rowley soils contain less clay and more sand in the lower part of the sola and have the lower part of the B horizon and the C horizon formed in sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Loran soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping ridgetops and hillside benches. Slope gradients range from 0 to 12 percent. Loran soils formed in 76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 inches) of loess, a thin layer of glacial till in some pedons, and the underlying residuum weathered from calcareous clayey shale of Pennsylvanian and Ordovician age. The mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 10.6 degrees C (46 to 51 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 940 mm (34 to 37 inches)."

The Keltner soils are moderately well drained or well drained and are downslope from the Loran soils. Calamine soils are poorly drained and are on nearly level or depressional areas, and have a thinner layer of loess. The well drained or moderately well drained Derinda and Eleroy soils lack mollic epipedons, and in addition, the Derinda soils have a thinner layer of loess. They are on similar landscape positions to the Loran soils. Drummer soils are poorly drained and formed in loess and the underlying glacial drift. They are upslope on nearly level positions of the landscape. Ridott soils are poorly drained and have a thinner dark colored surface soil. They are upslope from the Loran soils. Schapville and Shullsburg soils are shallower to the underlying shale than the Loran soils. They are on similar positions on the landscape."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second)  in the material formed in loess and glacial till and moderately low to moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers per second) in the residuum weathered from shale. Permeability is moderate in the material formed in loess and glacial till and slow in the residuum weathered from shale."
