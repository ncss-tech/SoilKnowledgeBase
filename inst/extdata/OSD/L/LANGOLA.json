  "REVDATE": "03/2003",
  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Langola series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in a mantle of sandy glacial outwash or eolian sediments and the underlying dense loamy glacial till on moraines and drumlins. These soils have a densic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Permeability is rapid in the sandy mantle and very slow in the dense till. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the sandy mantle ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The depth to free carbonates is greater than 60 inches. Depth to a densic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. The sandy mantle does not have rock fragments.  Some pedons have a coarse textured layer, up to 6 inches thick, with 10 to 35 percent gravel and cobbles at the contact with the glacial till (lag line). Volume of rock fragments in the 2B horizon and 2C horizon ranges from 1 to 15 percent. The rock fragments are of mixed lithology but mostly of igneous rock.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. The AB horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3. The A horizons are loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR with hue of 7.5YR in the lower part of some pedons, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Redox features are faint to prominent. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Some pedons have hue of 10YR in the 2Bt horizon. It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam. The reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid. Redox features are faint to prominent\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or less commonly 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral. Bulk density ranges from 1.65 to 1.95 gm/cc.\nThe 2BCd horizon has hue of 7.5YR or less commonly 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral. Bulk density ranges from 1.8 5to 2.0 gm/cc. This is considered to be a densic contact."

They formed in a sandy mantle either of eolian or outwash origin or both, over Superior Lobe dense loamy glacial till of Late Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual air temperature is 37 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 24 to 33 inches. Frost-free days range from 90 to 145. Elevation above sea level ranges from 670 to 1450 feet."

The excessively drained Kost soils formed entirely in outwash sediments. The very poorly drained Nokasippi and poorly drained Watab soils occupy lower positions on the landscape."
