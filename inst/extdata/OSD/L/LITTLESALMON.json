  "OVERVIEW": "The Littlesalmon series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in material weathered from granite, gneiss, and schist with an admixture of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part.  Littlesalmon soils are on steep and very steep mountainsides.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
