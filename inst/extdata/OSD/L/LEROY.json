The location given for this same pedon in the published survey of Dodge County places it in a B slope map unit of LeRoy.  Therefore, the location from the published survey is used in this OSD and the slope is changed from 8 percent to 5 percent.\nThese soils formerly were included with the Miami series.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon -  0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches) (AP).\nArgillic horizon - 23 to 56 cm (9 to 22 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
