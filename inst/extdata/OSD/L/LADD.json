  "OVERVIEW": "The Ladd series consists of deep, well drained soils that\nformed in alluvium weathered from basic igneous rocks and\nquartz diorite mixed with loess and volcanic ash.  Ladd\nsoils are on alluvial fans, terraces and footslopes and have\nslopes of 0 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is\nabout 15 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 47\ndegrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth of bedrock is 60 inches\nor more.  These soils are usually moist and are moist in\nsome part above the lower boundary of the moisture control\nsection for at least one half the time (cumulative) when the\nsoil temperature at depth of 20 inches exceeds 41 degrees F\nin most years.  These soils are dry for 80 to 90 consecutive\ndays.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52\ndegrees F.  There are less than 35 percent rock fragments in\nthe texture control section.  The sola are slightly acid or\nneutral, commonly increasing in alkalinity as depth\nincreases and have 10YR or 7.5YR hue.  The mollic epipedon\nis 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and\nchroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is silt loam, sandy loam,\nor loam.  The upper part of the A horizon has platy\nstructure in some pedons.  The A horizon is high in volcanic\nash.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 6\ndry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is sandy\nclay loam, clay loam or loam and averages 18 to 35 percent\nclay.  It has few patchy thin to many continuous thin clay\nfilms on peds and in pores with moderately thick films in\nsome pedons.  It has weak coarse prismatic to moderate\nmedium prismatic and subangular blocky structure.\nThe C or 2C horizon has similar range in color as the Bt\nhorizon and is dominantly moderately fine textured, but\nincludes sandy loam and loam.  In some pedons the lower part\nof the 2C horizon is slightly calcareous."

Colma soils have black A horizons thicker than\n10 inches, have mottled B horizons overlying slowly to very\nslowly permeable C horizons.  Facey soils lack any quartz\ndiorite mixed with volcanic ash and have a solum thickness\nof more than 40 inches.  Foehlin soils have a mean annual\nsoil temperature of 52 to 56 degrees F.  Taneum soils are\ndry in the moisture control section for 60 to 80 days.\nTieton soils have a calcareous C horizon with secondary\ncarbonates and have bedrock within 60 inches.  Yaxon soils\nare dry for 80 to 105 consecutive days.  Jauriga, Taneum,\nand Tieton soils are not clearly differentiated."
