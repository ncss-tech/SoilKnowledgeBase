  "OVERVIEW": "The Los Gatos series is a member of the fine-loamy, mixed, mesic family of Typic Argixerolls.  Typically, Los Gatos soils have brown, light clay loam, granular, slightly acid A1 horizons, brown and yellowish red, slightly and medium acid clay loam and gravelly clay loam Bt horizons over sandstone bedrock at a depth of 36 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to sandstone is 24 to 40 inches.  The soil between depths of about 5 and 12 inches usually is dry from sometime in May until sometime in October.  It usually is moist the rest of the year.  The mean annual soil temperature is 54 to 58 degrees F and the soil temperature is very briefly, if ever, below 47 degrees F. Typically, there are few rock fragments in the upper horizons and less than 35 percent in the lower horizons.  The solum ranges from neutral to moderately acid.  Typically, the A horizon is slightly acid and the B horizon is moderately acid.\nThe A horizon is mostly brown, dark brown, grayish brown, dark grayish brown, or yellowish brown in 10YR or 7.5YR hue and some pedons are reddish brown in 5YR hue.  Moist value and moist chroma are 2 or 3.  This horizon is fine sandy loam, loam or clay loam.  It has granular or subangular blocky structure or has crumb structure in the upper part.  The lower boundary of the A horizon is gradual or an A3 horizon or a BA horizon is present.  The organic matter ranges from 2 to 6 percent.\nThe Bt horizon is pinkish gray, light reddish brown, reddish yellow, brown, strong brown, or light brown in 7.5YR hue or reddish brown or yellowish red in 5YR hue.  It is heavy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam with less than 35 percent clay.  Absolute clay increases from A horizon to B2t horizon ranges from about 5 to about 9 percent.  The Bt horizon has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure.  In some pedons, it rests on bedrock.  In other pedons, there is a brownish yellow or yellowish brown B3 horizon or a C horizon above the bedrock."

Colma, Lobitos, and Sweeney soils lack brown and reddish color of 7.5YR and 5YR hue in the Bt horizon.  Colma, Dragoon, Glenrose, Ladd, and Sweeney soils lack a lithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Gilroy soils have a mean soil temperature of 59 to 64 degrees F.  Los Osos soils have more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Mehlhorn soils have a mean soil temperature of less than 54 degrees F.  Sobrante soils lack a mollic epipedon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Los Gatos soils are on steep to very steep mountainous areas at elevations of 200 to 4,000 feet.  They formed in residuum from sandstone, shale and metasedimentary rock.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 20 to 70 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 52 to 56 degrees F with an average January temperature of about 47 degrees F and an average July temperature of about 68 degrees F. Freeze-free season is about 200 to 330 days."

Gamboa, Henneke, Plaskett, and Sur soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the texture control section.  Godde soils ahve bedrock at depths of less than 20 inches.  Maymen and Millsholm soils have ochric epipedons."
