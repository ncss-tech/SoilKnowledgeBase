  "REVDATE": "11/98",
  "STATES": "NE",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lisco series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly  drained soils on flood plains and low stream terraces.  They are strongly and very strongly saline-alkali soils that formed in loamy and sandy alluvium that, in places, has been reworked by wind.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Permeability is moderately rapid.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F, at the type location.",

Free carbonates are at a depth of 0 to 10 inches.\nThe A and E horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 5 through 7 and 3 through 5 moist with chroma of 1 or 2.  They are typically very fine sandy loam, but range to include loam and fine sandy loam.  They are typically slightly alkaline through very strongly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon and BC horizon, where present, have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 and 3 through 5 moist with chroma of 1 or 2.  They are typically very fine sandy loam, but range to include fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, and loam.  They are typically very strongly alkaline, but range to include strongly alkaline.  They have an exchangeable sodium percentabe (ESP) of 15 or more, or an SAR of 13 or more in half or more of the soil volume within 20 inches (50 cm) of the mineral surface which decreases in value with increasing depth below 20 inches (50 cm).\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 and 4 through 7 moist with chroma of 1 through 3.  It is typically fine sandy loam and loamy fine sand, but ranges to include all textures from loam to gravelly sand.  The sand and gravelly sand are at depths greater than 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from moderately alkaline through very strongly alkaline.  Free carbonates are commonly present, but are absent in the lower part of some pedons."

All the above soils, except Marlake and Valent are on similar landscapes and lack the saline-alkali characteristics of Lisco soils.  The Bankard soils are sandy and stratified.  The Craft soils are coarse-silty and stratified.  Gering soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal.  The Glenberg soils have a water table at depths greater than 6 feet and are stratified.  Las Animas soils are very deep and stratified.  The Marlake soils have a seasonal high water table at +2.0 to 1.0 feet and are in depressions.  McGrew soils are coarse-loamy and have coarse sand or gravelly sand at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  The Valent soils are sandy and are on higher landscapes.  Yockey soils are coarse-silty and stratified."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Lisco soils were formerly correlated as Sandy saline-alkali soils, Saline-alkali land, and Janise soils.  The above typical pedon (S76NE-123-44) was analyzed by the National Soil Survey Laboratory as sample numbers 76PO803-76PO809.  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to 4 inches (A and E horizons); cambic horizon--the zone from 4 to 22 inches (Bw1, Bw2 and Bw3 horizons)."
