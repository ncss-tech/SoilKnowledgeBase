  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is from 10 to 20 inches thick.  The calcic horizon is at a depth of 17 to 27 inches.  Depth to very gravelly sand is 20 to 35 inches.  Organic matter decreases regularly or reaches a level of less than 1 percent within 20 inches.  The soils are not usually dry but are dry in the 7 to 20 inch section for more than 45 consecutive days in most years.  Mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F.  Summer temperatures are 65 to 72 degrees F.  The soils are neutral to moderately alkaline.  Coarse fragments are dominantly gravel size but may include cobbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  Clay content is 16 to 22 percent.  This horizon is noncalcareous.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  This horizon is gravelly sandy clay loam, gravelly fine sandy loam or gravelly sandy clay loam.  Clay content is 18 to 25 percent.  Rock fragment content is 15 to 65 percent.  Carbonate equivalent is 0 to 10 percent.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 4 to 6 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  Clay content is 10 to 15 percent.  Rock fragment content is 35 to 80 percent.  Carbonate equivalent is 15 to 40 percent including lime coatings on rock fragments.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Clay content is 0 to 5 percent.  Rock fragment content is 35 to 60 percent.  Carbonate equivalent is 5 to 40 percent.  Coarse fragments are well coated with carbonates."

Alpowa, Copperton, Hupp and Stricker soils lack a very gravelly sand horizon within the control section.  Middle soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Bonnet soils lack cambic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lakewin soils are on gently sloping to steep lake terraces of old Lake Bonneville with slopes of 1 to 30 percent.  Elevations ranges from 4,600 to 5,200 feet.  They formed in alluvium and lacustrine sediments derived from a mixture of rock sources.  The climate is dry subhumid.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 52 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches and the freeze-free period is 140 to 170 days."
