  "OVERVIEW": "The Lakewin series consists of very deep well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils.  These soils formed in alluvium and underlying lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rock sources on lake terraces of ancient Lake Bonneville and fan terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

Organic matter decreases regularly or reaches a level of less than 1 percent within 20 inches.  The soils are not usually dry but are dry in the 7 to 20 inch section for more than 45 consecutive days in most years.  Mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F.  Summer temperatures are 65 to 72 degrees F.  The soils are neutral to moderately alkaline.  Coarse fragments are dominantly gravel size but may include cobbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  Clay content is 16 to 22 percent.  This horizon is noncalcareous.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  This horizon is gravelly sandy clay loam, gravelly fine sandy loam or gravelly sandy clay loam.  Clay content is 18 to 25 percent.  Rock fragment content is 15 to 65 percent.  Carbonate equivalent is 0 to 10 percent.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 4 to 6 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  Clay content is 10 to 15 percent.  Rock fragment content is 35 to 80 percent.  Carbonate equivalent is 15 to 40 percent including lime coatings on rock fragments.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Clay content is 0 to 5 percent.  Rock fragment content is 35 to 60 percent.  Carbonate equivalent is 5 to 40 percent.  Coarse fragments are well coated with carbonates."
