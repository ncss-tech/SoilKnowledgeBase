  "OVERVIEW": "The Libby series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Libby soils are on stream terraces and relict basin floors.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.",

Thought to have formed from calcium and magnesium that precipitated out during fluctuating seasonal water tables under a climate much wetter than the present.  Repeated wetting and extreme drying of the soil may have been a factor in nodule development.
