Thought to have formed from calcium and magnesium that precipitated out during fluctuating seasonal water tables under a climate much wetter than the present.  Repeated wetting and extreme drying of the soil may have been a factor in nodule development.

These soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December to February.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 230 days."
