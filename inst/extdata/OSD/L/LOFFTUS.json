  "OVERVIEW": "The Lofftus series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits and surficial deposits of eolian volcanic ash.  Lofftus soils are on basin-floor remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
