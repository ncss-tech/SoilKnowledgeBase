  "OVERVIEW": "The Levelland series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in loamy reworked alluvial sediments of Quaternary age. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on ephemeral streams on draws. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 483 mm (19 in), and mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).",
