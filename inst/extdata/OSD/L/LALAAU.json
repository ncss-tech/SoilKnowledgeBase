  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lalaau soils are on mid elevation, windward mountain slopes on the upland of Mauna Loa Volcano at elevations from 1,067 to 2,134 meters (3,500 to 7,000 feet). The soils are on all hillslope positions of constructional landscapes consisting of undulating to hilly `a`a lava flows. Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent. The soils formed mainly in organic material consisting of decomposed leaves, twigs, and wood; and to a lesser degree basic volcanic ash, cinders, and weathered lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 1,524 to more than 3,810 millimeters (60 to more than 150 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 640 to 1,270 meters (25 to 50 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 15 degrees C (52 to 59 degrees F). The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
