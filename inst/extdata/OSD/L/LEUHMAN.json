    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Casaga, Garces, Gothard, Norob, and Polvadero (T) series.  Casaga soils have a strong varnished desert pavement and 30 to 75 percent gravel in the substratum.  Garces have E horizons, lack lithologic discontinuities above the substratum, and have substratums that are stratified sandy loam to clay loam.  Gothard soils have appreciable moisture in the soil moisture control section in the summer. Norob soils have 7.5YR colors in the profile, lack 2.5Y and 5Y colors in the profile, and have an abrupt textural change between the A and B horizons. Polvadero soils are well drained and have calcic horizons."

    "content": "REMARKS: The Leuhman series is in MLRA 30.\nRunoff classes based on Ksat and slope as described in \"Terminology Used in Soil Survey Data Entry or Manuscript Editing of:\" 9-23-94 MAV.  Runoff changed from ponded or very slow to medium.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon -- 0 to 2 inches (A)\n2. Natric horizon -- 2 to 24 inches (2Btkn1, 2Btkn2, 2Btkn3).\n4. Particle Size Family -- Fine-loamy.  The 2 to 22 inch particle-size control section averages 30 percent clay based on field estimates.\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 9/2015. The last revision to the series was 2/1988. ET\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
