Garces have E horizons, lack lithologic discontinuities above the substratum, and have substratums that are stratified sandy loam to clay loam.  Gothard soils have appreciable moisture in the soil moisture control section in the summer. Norob soils have 7.5YR colors in the profile, lack 2.5Y and 5Y colors in the profile, and have an abrupt textural change between the A and B horizons. Polvadero soils are well drained and have calcic horizons."

Natric horizon -- 2 to 24 inches (2Btkn1, 2Btkn2, 2Btkn3).\n4. Particle Size Family -- Fine-loamy.  The 2 to 22 inch particle-size control section averages 30 percent clay based on field estimates.\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 9/2015.
