  "OVERVIEW": "The Leatherwood series consists of very deep, well drained, soils on ridges and side slopes in the Southern Blue Ridge (MLRA 130B). These soils formed in residuum that is affected by soil creep in the upper part and weathered from intermediate to mafic igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks. Slopes range from 8 to 95 percent.",

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cheoah, Colepoint, Crutchfield, Meda, Molalla, Santeetlah, Threeforks, and Tuckasegee series. Cheoah and Santeetlah soils formed in materials weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks such as phyllite and slate, and contain fragments of those rocks. Colepoint soils have lithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Crutchfield soils have lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Meda soils formed in loamy alluvium and colluvium and contain a lithologic discontinuity. Molalla soils have paralithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Threeforks soils have mollic colors which may extend to depths of 60 inches. Tuckasegee soils formed in colluvium and have C horizons of colluvial material rather than saprolite."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Leatherwood soils are, generally, on steep to very steep side slopes of the Blue Ridge (MLRA 130B). However, these soils also occur on strongly sloping to moderately steep shaded ridges. Leatherwood soils are more common in head slopes with slopes greater than 500 feet in length. Elevation ranges from about 2,500 to 4,800 feet. These soils are more common at upper end of the elevation range (above 3,700 feet). These soils are on cool, shaded slopes. In the hottest part of the day (from 2 to 5 P.M.) these soils are in passive sunlight. Slope is commonly between 30 to 80 percent but ranges from 8 to 95 percent. Leatherwood soils formed in residuum, affected by soil creep in the upper part, weathered from intermediate or mafic, igneous or high-grade metamorphic rocks such as hornblende gneiss, mica gneiss, and amphibolite. Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 45 to 80 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: In addition to the competing Tuckasegee series, these include the Burton, Cowee, Craggey, Cullasaja, Evard, Clifton, Haywood, Porters, Tusquitee, and Wayah series. Burton, Craggey, and Wayah soils are in a frigid soil temperature class, and are at higher elevations. Additionally, Burton soils have lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches, and Craggey soils have lithic contact at depths less than 20 inches. Chestnut and Edneyville soils have ochric epipedons and are on warmer and drier parts of the landscapes, typically on south to west aspects. Cullasaja, Haywood, and Tusquitee soils formed in colluvium, have C horizons of colluvial material, and are in coves and on toe slopes at locally lower elevations. Porters soils have lithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches and have a thinner A horizons."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of this soil is in forest. The dominant forest type consists of northern red oak associated with black cherry, sugar maple, American beech, black oak, black birch, yellow birch, sweet birch, yellow-poplar, eastern hemlock, and black locust. The dominant forest type is yellow poplar below 3,000 feet. In the drier, warmer part of the range, upland oaks, hickory, black gum, red maple, and eastern white pine are associated. At elevations greater than 4000 feet, yellow-poplar is replaced with other hardwoods in the cover type. Flowering dogwood, mountain-laurel, silverbell, striped maple, serviceberry, rhododendron, red maple, blueberry, trillium, Solomons seal, and woodfern are common understory species. Approximately 5 percent of this soil is cleared and used for pasture, ornamentals, and Christmas trees. These areas are largely on slopes less than 35 percent."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Leatherwood series was formerly included with the Porters series. However, the Porters series has hard bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches below the surface, an A horizon that is 6 to 10 inches thick, and is in the fine-loamy particle size class.\nThese soils formed in residuum that is affected by soil creep in the upper part. The upper part of the profile has sub-rounded fragments indicating a down slope movement of this material. The thickness of the transported material is dependent on the length, steepness and shape of the sideslope. In general, soil creep is transport material less than 40 inches thick.\nRevisions made 9/07(HCD) adjusted OSD to reflect Lab Data.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon the mineral soil surface to 15 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)\nCambic horizon - 15 to 79 inches (Bw1, Bw2 and BC horizons)"
