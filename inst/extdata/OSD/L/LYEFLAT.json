  "OVERVIEW": "The Lyeflat series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in eolian material and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Lyeflat soils are on hills. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
