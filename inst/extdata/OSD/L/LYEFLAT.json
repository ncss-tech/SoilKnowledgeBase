These soils formed in mixed eolian material and colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as basalt or welded tuff. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 1,295 to 1,700 meters. The climate is arid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
