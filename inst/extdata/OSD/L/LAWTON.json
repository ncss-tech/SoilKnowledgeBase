  "STATES": "OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lawton series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy material weathered from old alluvium from granitic material and associated mixed rocks.  These nearly level to sloping soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans of the Wichita Mountains.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 27 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F.",
