  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This revision of March 2001 updates the taxonomic classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Torriorthentic Haploborolls and recognizes the presence of a cambic horizon. Further study is needed to determine if this series actually has a xeric moisture regime instead of ustic. If the moisture regime is xeric it classifies in the subgroup of Calcic Haploxerolls. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - 0 to 8 inches (A and ABk horizons).\nCambic horizon - 8 to 39 inches (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates - 4 to 60 inches (ABk, Bk1, Bk2, and Ck horizons).\nParticle-size control section - 10 to 40 inches (Bk2 horizon and parts of the Bk1 and Ck horizons).\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 9/2015. The last revision to the series was 7/2006. ET\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
