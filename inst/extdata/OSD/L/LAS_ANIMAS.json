  "OVERVIEW": "The Las Animas series consists of deep, poorly and somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in thick calcareous stratified alluvial materials derived from mixed sources.  Las Animas soils are on valley flood plain and low stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
