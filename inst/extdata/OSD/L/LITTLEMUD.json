  "OVERVIEW": "The Littlemud series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from quartzite or rhyolite.  Littlemud soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 760 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
