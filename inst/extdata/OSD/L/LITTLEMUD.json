    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Littlemud soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from quartzite or rhyolite.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 2,290 to 2,750 meters.  The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 500 to 760 mm, the mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."
