  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of the Bt, (argillic horizon) and to continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulations (calcic horizon) is 5 to 10 inches. Depth to bedrock is typically greater than 60 inches, but soft bedrock occurs at 40 to 60 inches in some pedons. The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is about 59 to 63 degrees F. The particle-size control section from the top of the argillic horizon to a depth of 40 inches when averaged is a clay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay modified with 35 to 60 percent pebbles and 0 to 10 percent cobbles. EC ranges from 0 to 8 mmhos through the soil to a depth of 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay. These textures may be modified with rock fragments whose combined volume does not exceed 35 percent. Pebbles range from 0 to 35 percent and cobbles from 0 to 5 percent. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk calcic horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4. Matrix textures are loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay, 35 to 60 percent pebbles and, 0 to 10 percent cobbles. Some pedons have a sandy loam matrix. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 35 percent. Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline. In some pedons a thin Bk1 horizon with 15 to 35 percent rock fragments is present.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. Matrix texture is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy loam with clay content ranging from 15 to 30 percent and 35 to 60 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles. Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline. The C horizon is absent in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lupinto soils are on relict alluvial fan aprons, terraces, and valley fills of cold intermountain basins. These soils formed in calcareous gravelly alluvium from mixed sources overlain with finer sediments. Slopes both simple and complex range from 2 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 5,000 to 8,300 feet. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 14 inches of which about half falls as snow and rain in April, May, and early June. The mean annual temperature is about 39 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is estimated to range from 60 to 100 days depending upon aspect, elevation, and air drainage."
