  "OVERVIEW": "The Lisade series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from limestone, sandstone and shale. Lisade soils are on alluvial fans, alluvial flats, fan remnants, fan skirts or plains. Slopes are 1 to 12 percent. The mean annual temperature is 8.5 degrees C., the mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.",
