  "OVERVIEW": "The Lebec series is a member of the fine-loamy, mixed, mesic family of Calcic Haploxerolls.  Typically, Lebec soils have brown and dark brown, calcareous loam A horizons and dark brown calcareous gravelly heavy loam C horizons that overlie hard limestone at a depth of 39 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to rock is 30 to 40 inches and averages about 36.  Small weathered limestone fragments are scattered through the soil but the average volume below a depth of 10 inches does not exceed 35 percent.  The soils are calcareous and moderately alkaline throughout.  The mean soil temperature is about 57 degrees F. and the soil temperature does not go below 41 degrees F. in winter.  The soils are continuously dry above a depth of 20 inches in most years for about 6 1/2 months each year.  The A horizon is brown, dark brown or grayish brown in hue of 10YR or 7.5YR with dry value of 4 or 5, moist value of 3 and chroma of 3 or 2.  It is loam or heavy loam and the control section has about 18 to 25 percent clay.  This horizon has granular or subangular blocky of moderate or strong grade.  It contains 2 to 3 percent organic matter in the upper 10 inches which decreases to less than 1 percent by a depth of 20 inches.  The lower A or C horizons or both have lime segregations as filaments, masses, and threads on many surfaces.  The C horizon is similar in color to the A horizon or is one value lighter and includes areas of strong brown (7.5YR 5/6, 5/8)."

Calera soils are very dark grayish brown and the summer and winter soil temperatures differ by less than 9 degrees F.  Linne, Nacimiento, and San Benito soils have a mean soil temperature above 59 degrees F.  Permanente soils are less than 20 inches deep and have more than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Tiger Creek soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR."

The climate is one of hot dry summers.  Winters are moderately cold and moist with frequent snow storms of short duration.  Average annual precipitation is 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F., the average January temperature is 40 degrees F., the average July temperature is 74 degrees F.; the frost-free season is about 210 days."
