  "OVERVIEW": "The Lambman series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to weakly consolidated sandstone.  They formed in mixed slope alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone.  Lambman soils are on uplands.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock and paralithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 5 to 14 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 53 degrees F.  The soils are dry for more than 60 consecutive days and 80 cumulative days in the moisture control section during July 15 through October 31.  Coarse fragment content is less than 15 percent throughout the profile.  These soils typically lack salts more soluble than gypsum throughout but EC may range from 0 to 2 in some subsoils and substrata.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam, or loam with 20 to 35 percent clay.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw, Bc, or Bk horizons, if present, have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Carbonates range from 0 to 10 percent.  Textures are clay loam, loam, or sandy loam with some pedons having a thin loam sand immediately above the bedrock.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe bedrock consists of either calcareous or noncalcareous, weakly consolidated sandstone many feet thick.  The soil-bedrock interface inhibits root penetration and is considered to be a paralithic contact."
