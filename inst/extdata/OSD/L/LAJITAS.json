Slopes are from 5 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches. Mean annual air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 220 to 280 days, and elevation is 2,000 to 4,500 feet."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 1 inches (A horizon)\nLithic contact - the boundary with hard rock at 4 inches (R horizon)\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nRevised for the correlation of AZ661, 2/2009, WWJ\nRevised for the correlation of AZ675, 5/2009, WWJ\nType location was moved in July 2009.  A temperature study in West Texas was completed and the original type location located in Big Bend National Park was determined to have a hyperthermic temperature regime.  The original pedon was correlated to Studybutte.  The type location was moved to AZ669 Pima County, AZ, Eastern Part to keep the series concept in the thermic temperature regime consistent with the original concept. The range in characteristics was slightly adjusted to reflect the correlated data from AZ661, AZ669, AZ675, and AZ703.  CEM\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
