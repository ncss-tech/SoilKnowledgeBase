  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. CCC/CEM",
  "REVDATE": "08/2009",
  "STATES": "AZ,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lajitas series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained, moderately rapid over very slowly permeable bedrock. The soils developed in residuum and colluvium from slightly fractured volcanic bedrock.  These soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 67 degrees F.",

A temperature study in West Texas was completed and the original type location located in Big Bend National Park was determined to have a hyperthermic temperature regime.  The original pedon was correlated to Studybutte.  The type location was moved to AZ669 Pima County, AZ, Eastern Part to keep the series concept in the thermic temperature regime consistent with the original concept. The range in characteristics was slightly adjusted to reflect the correlated data from AZ661, AZ669, AZ675, and AZ703.  CEM"
