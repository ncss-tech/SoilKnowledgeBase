  "OVERVIEW": "The Lanfair series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from metamorphic sources. Lanfair soils are on inset fans or alluvial fans. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.",
