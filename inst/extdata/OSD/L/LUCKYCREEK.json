The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick. Depth to secondary carbonates is 25 to 40 inches.  The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section is 25 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry in the upper part and 4 or 5 dry in the lower part and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 0 to 15 percent gravel.  It is loam or sandy loam with 15 to 25 percent clay.  It has 5 to 15 percent glass and the acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the oxalate iron is 0.4 to 0.7 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam and contains 5 to 30 percent gravel.  It has 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is loam or clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay and contains 5 to 40 percent gravel. It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  It is slightly to violently effervescent.  It has 5 to 15 percent calcium carbonate."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in eolian and colluvium with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, the mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F, and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."
