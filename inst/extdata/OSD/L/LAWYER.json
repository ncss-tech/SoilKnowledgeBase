  "OVERVIEW": "The Lawyer series consists of deep and very deep, well drained slowly permeable soils on steep and very steep north-facing canyon slopes. They formed in loess, slope alluvium and material weathered from Columbia River basalt or other volcanics. Slope ranges from 15 to 90 percent. The average annual temperature is 48 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is 20 inches.",
