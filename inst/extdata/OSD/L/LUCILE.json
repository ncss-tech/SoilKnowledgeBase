  "OVERVIEW": "The Lucile series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in ash-influenced loess overlying glacial till or glaciofluvial sediments.  Lucile soils are on stream terraces and moraines.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is about 25 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 14 to 20 inches thick.  Most pedons are bisequal.  The loess mantle is 15 to 30 inches thick.  Mottles are present in the albic horizon or the upper part of the spodic horizon.  The ratio of free iron to carbon is more than 0.2 in parts of the spodic horizon.  Based on morphological evidence, the water table is commonly above 20 inches.  However, the water table ranges below 48 inches in those pedons having altered drainage due to natural lowering of the water table.  Reaction of the profile ranges from strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value moist from 3 to 5; and chroma moist of 1 or 2.\nThe B horizons have hue from 5YR to 10YR; value and chroma moist from 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe buried sola, when present, is similar to the surface sola in color and texture.  Hue ranges to 2.5Y in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon is sand with 25 to 50 percent coarse fragments.  Coarse fragments include 5 to 10 percent cobble and 20 to 40 percent gravel.  The upper part of the horizon, in some pedons, consists of a layer of sand up to 6 inches thick over the gravelly strata."

Ahrnklin(T), Caswell, Grewingk, and Longmare soils do not have amorphous material within the control section.  Kadake(T) soils have more than 35 percent clay within the control section.  Purches(T) soils average more than 35 percent coarse fragments throughout the entire control section.  Spenard soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the lower part of the control section."
