  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 40 to 60 inches. Coarse sand and very coarse sand averages more than 5 percent in the control section.\nThe A horizon has color value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 or 2. Where present, an Ap horizon has color value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 5.\nThe E horizon has color value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4, but is often absent in eroded pedons. The A and E horizons are typically loam, but silt loam, clay loam and fine sandy loam are within the range.  Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6; rarely 8. It is clay loam or loam. It ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid. It commonly is mottled in The lower part. Rock fragments range from a few pebbles to 5 percent gravel.\nThe C horizon is mottled with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. It is loam or clay loam and slightly acid to moderately alkaline. Rock fragments average from 1 to 5 percent."

The Amanda, Belmont, Belmore, Chenault, Chili, Coggon, Conestoga, Kendallville, Kosciusco, Leroy, Ockley, Rainsville, Richland, and Wykoff soils average more than 5 percent rock fragments in the lower one-third of their control sections. Hayden soils have mean annual soil temperature of less than 52 degrees F. at a depth of 20 inches. Hebron, Kanawha, and Sisson soils average less than 1 percent rock fragments in their control sections. Hickory soils have free carbonates at 40 to 60 inches and have more illite in their control sections than any other mineral. High Gap, Mandeville, Military, Norden, and Whalan soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths less than 40 inches. Hollinger soils have sola that do not extend beyond a depth of 40 inches. Douds, El Dara, Gallman, Grellton, Kalamazoo, McHenry, Mifflin, and Nodine soils average more than 52 percent sand in some subhorizon in the lower one-third of their control sections. Kidder, Miami, Strawn, Theresa, and Wawasee soils have free carbonates at depths less than 40 inches. Letort, and Martinsville soils have subhorizons that contain more than 50 percent silt in their control sections.  Owosso, Princeton, Rawson, and Renova soils have more than 52 percent sand in the upper one-half of their control sections. Pecatonica, Summitville, and Westville soils have hues of 5YR or redder on faces of peds or in the matrix of their control sections. Relay soils have hues yellower than 10YR throughout their control sections. Riddles soils have subhorizons that contain more than 52 percent sand in the middle one-third of their control sections.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lindley soils are on valley side slopes and narrowly dissected interfluves. The slope gradients range from 5 to 60 percent. The soils are thought to have formed in pre-Illinoinan glacial till and they may have a thin mantle of loess. Mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 42 inches."

The Armster, Armstrong, Clinton, Gorin, Hatton, Keswick, Rathbun, and Weller soils contain more than 35 percent clay in their control sections and are upslope from Lindley soils. Gara soils have thicker A horizons, and are upslope or in similar positions. Goss soils are cherty in the subsoil and downslope from Lindley soil. Winfield soils are fine-silty. They are upslope from Lindley soils, or are near the bluffs of major streams."
