  "OVERVIEW": "The Lindley series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on uplands. They formed in glacial till and may have a thin mantle of loess. Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent. Mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 40 to 60 inches. Coarse sand and very coarse sand averages more than 5 percent in the control section.\nThe A horizon has color value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 or 2. Where present, an Ap horizon has color value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 5.\nThe E horizon has color value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4, but is often absent in eroded pedons. The A and E horizons are typically loam, but silt loam, clay loam and fine sandy loam are within the range.  Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6; rarely 8. It is clay loam or loam. It ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid. It commonly is mottled in The lower part. Rock fragments range from a few pebbles to 5 percent gravel.\nThe C horizon is mottled with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. It is loam or clay loam and slightly acid to moderately alkaline. Rock fragments average from 1 to 5 percent."

Gara soils have thicker A horizons, and are upslope or in similar positions. Goss soils are cherty in the subsoil and downslope from Lindley soil. Winfield soils are fine-silty.
