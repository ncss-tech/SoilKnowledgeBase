    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The clayey Btg horizon or clayey part of the BCg horizon extends to 60 to 90 inches below the surface.  The soil is moderately acid to extremely acid unless limed. The A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, or it is neutral, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. The E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 4.  The A, Ap, and E horizons are loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam.\nThe BE or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 8, and has few to common mottles with chroma of 2 or less.  It is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8, has few to many mottles with chroma of 2 or less.  In some pedons, this horizon does not have a matrix color but is mottled in shades of gray, yellow, brown, or red. The Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Mottles in shades of yellow, brown, or red are common to many.  Clay content in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon is 35 to 60 percent and silt content is more than 30 percent.  The Bt and Btg horizons are clay, clay loam, silty clay, or silty clay loam.\nThe BCg horizon colors are similar to the Btg horizon.  It is clay, sandy clay, clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Cg horizon, in addition to the colors of the Btg and BCg horizons, may have hue of 5Y, or it is neutral, with value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is stratified sandy, loamy, or clayey sediment."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: (This section was not updated; 2/97) The Kinta series is the only other known series in this family.  Those in closely related families are the Angie, Bethera, Bladen, Cantey, Coxville, Craven, Dogue, Dunbar, Duplin, Grady, Leaf, Nahunta, Persanti, Roanoke, Smithboro, Tomast, and Wahee series.  Kinta soils have finer textured A and upper B horizons with prominent red mottles in the upper Bt horizon.  Angie, Craven, Dogue, Duplin, and Persanti soils have a udic moisture regime and lack colors with chroma of 2 or less in the upper Bt horizon.  Bethera, Bladen, Cantey, Coxville, Grady, and Leaf soils have dominant chroma of 2 or less in all subhorizons between the A and Ap horizon and 30 inches below the surface.  Dunbar and Smithboro soils have kaolinitic mineralogy. Nahunta and Tomast soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon.  Wahee soils have more than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the sand and silt fractions and also have than a 20 percent decrease in clay content from the maximum within 60 inches of the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lenoir soils are on nearly level interstream divides of the Coastal Plain.  Slope gradients are less than 2 percent. The soil formed in stratified, clayey sediments of marine or fluvial origin.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 48 inches.  Areas near the type location are not subject to flooding, but frequency for the series ranges from none to common."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  In addition to the competing Bethera, Bladen, Craven, and Leaf series, these are the Bayboro, Caroline, Exum, Goldsboro, Grantham, Lynchburg, Nahunta, Norfolk, and Rains.  Bayboro soils have very dark gray or black A horizons thicker than 10 inches. Caroline soils lack mottles with chroma of 2 or less within 30 inches of the surface.  Exum, Goldsboro, Grantham, Lynchburg, Nahunta, Norfolk, and Rains have 18 to 35 percent clay in the Bt horizon.  The more poorly drained Bayboro, Bethera, Bladen, Grantham, Leaf, and Rains soils are in flats and depressions.  The better drained Caroline, Craven, Exum, Goldsboro, and Norfolk soils are in slightly higher or more sloping areas.  Lynchburg and Nahunta soils are in similar positions with Lenoir soils."

The understory includes inkberry, sourwood, flowering dogwood, American holly, waxmyrtle, blueberry, honeysuckle, summersweet clethra, Carolina jessamine, poison ivy, switchcane, redbay, and greenbrier.  Cleared areas are used principally for growing corn, soybeans, tobacco, cotton, small grains, peanuts, truck crops, and pasture."
