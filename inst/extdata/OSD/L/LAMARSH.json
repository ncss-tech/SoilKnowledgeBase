  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Unless otherwise noted the entire range of properties permissible or the subgroup and family in which the series has been placed applies to the series as well.  These soils are noncalcareous throughout except that thin and discontinuously calcareous subhorizons may occur immediately above the bedrock.  Depth to the lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the control section.  Content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent in a major part of the control section and coarse fragments ranging from 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter predominate.  Mottling within the control section may range from no mottling to a few faint mottles but if the soil is consistently mottled the base chroma of the matrix material must be more than 2.   The control section should be uniform with only minor stratification.  Color of the A horizon may range in hue from 5Y to 7.5YR, in value from 5 to 7 dry or 3 to 6 moist8st, and in chroma from 1 to 4.  Reaction normally ranges from neutral to mildly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).  Hue of the C horizon ranges from 5Y to 7.5YR.  Reaction normally ranges from neutral to mildly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).  Texture ranges from loamy sand to sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Cothran, Tusler, and Yetull series.   The Cothran series differs in lacking bedrock above 40 inches.  The Tusler series differs in having a paralithic rather than a lithic contact, and in being calcareous.  The Yetull soils differ in being calcareous and in having no bedrock above 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The LaMarsh series occurs on gently to steeply sloping upland hills and ridges.  Slopes typically range from about 2 to 40 or more percent.  The soil is developing in moderately thin noncalcareous coarse textured materials weathered from sandstone and locally wind reworked.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual air temperature is 40 degrees F., mean summer air temperature is 62 degrees F., mean annual soil temperature is 44 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is 63 degrees F."
