Elevations are from 100 to 1550 feet (30 to 472 meters). The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters with potential fog common all year. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 24 inches (330 to 660 mm), the mean annual temperature is 61 to 73 degrees F. (16 to 23 degrees C.), and the frost free season is 355 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Starboard, Starbright, Halyard, Tongva soils.   All these soils are found on hills and mountains.  Starboard soils have a mesic temperature regime and are fine-loamy textured.  Starbright soils are iso-mesic and have a thick mollic epipedon.  Halyard soils do not have an abrupt textural change.  Tongva soils are fine-loamy textures."
