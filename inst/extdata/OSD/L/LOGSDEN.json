  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist, but may be dry for a period of up to 45 days between the depths of 4 to 12 inches following the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F. under a full canopy. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. The particle-size control section has 20 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon or Ap horizon, when present, has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It has 18 to 25 percent clay and 0 to 5 percent gravel. It has 5 to 12 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry. It is commonly stratified and ranges from loamy sand to loam with a clay content of 5 to 20 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Logsden soils are on low stream terraces subject to rare flooding along drainages in the west side of the Coast Range. Elevations are 20 to 300 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in alluvium. The climate is humid, characterized by cool, moist summers with fog, and cool, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 100 inches. The mean annual temperature is 49 to 53 degrees F. The mean January temperature is about 40 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F. The frost-free period is 160 to 300 days. This soil is mapped on the Winkle geomorphic surface."

Euchre soils are somewhat poorly drained and have andic soil properties.  Quillamook and Siletz have andic properties in the upper part of the profile. All these soils are on stream terraces."
