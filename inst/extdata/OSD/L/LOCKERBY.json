  "OVERVIEW": "The Lockerby series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly and very slowly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from shale. Lockerby soils are on hills and ridges and have slopes of 2 to 15 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
