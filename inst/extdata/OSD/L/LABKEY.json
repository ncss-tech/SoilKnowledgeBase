Annaw soils are also effervescent throughout all parts of the profile and Lyx soils do not have fine gravel of granitic rock. Pumper soils have cambic horizons with 12 to 25 percent clay. Toulon soils have 15 to 30 percent cobbles in the particle-size control section."

Elevations range from 1,160 to 1,555 meters. The climate is cool-arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 120 to 130 days."
