(A, AB horizons)  When the color and organic carbon content meet the requirements of a mollic epipedon, the horizon does not meet the moisture requirements for a mollic epipedon.\nCambic horizon - the zone from 7 to l6 inches (Bw horizon).\nCalcic horizon - the zone from l6 to 44 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizons).\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nThe mean annual precipitation of 8 to 10 inches is inconsistent with the ustic aridic moisture regime. Consideration should be given to reclassifying this soil in a Typic subgroup.\nRevised for the correlation of White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; October, 2014, NMS\nADDITIONAL DATA: Calcium carbonate equivalent determined by use of a volumetric calcimeter.\nUpdated competing series section 3/17/08, CEM\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
