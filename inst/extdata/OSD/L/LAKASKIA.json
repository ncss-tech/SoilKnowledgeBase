  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lakaskia soils are on nearly level or slightly depressional areas of lacustrine terraces and lake plains that are late Wisconsin age.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Lakaskia soils formed in loess and lacustrine sediments or a mixture of these materials.  Some areas are subject to shallow inudation during rare, extremely high flood events.  Near the type location these soils are protected by the Corps of Engineers dam and lake at Carlyle, but are in a position that flooding is possible.  Mean annual air temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F., mean annual soil temperature is 56 to 59 degrees F., mean annual precipitation 36 to 40 inches, frost-free period is 180 to 200 days, and elevation is 370 to 450 feet above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bartelso, Birds, Hurst, Okaw, Petrolia, and Wagner series.  The somewhat poorly drained Bartelso soils form a hydrosequence with the Lakaskia soils.  They are on slightly higher landform positions nearby.  The poorly drained Birds and Petrolia soils are on flood plains below the Lakaskia soils.  Hurst and Okaw soils have ochric epipedons and are the Alfisol equivalents of Bartelso and Lakaskia soils, respectively.  The poorly drained Wagner soils have a moderately dark surface layer and they form a biosequence with the Okaw and Lakaskia soils."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:  Mollic epipedon - from the surface of the soil to a depth of approximately 13 inches (Ap and A horizons).  Argillic horizon - from a depth of approximately 13 to 60 inches (Btg1, Btg2, 2Btkg1, 2Btkg2, and 2BCtkg horizons).  Aquic conditions - periodic saturation and reduction, indicated by redoximorphic features throughout the soil.  The boundary between the loess and the lacustrine sediments is often difficult to detect from field observations.\nThe typical pedon was resampled and described to 80 inches for this revision.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
