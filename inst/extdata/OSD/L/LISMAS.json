  "OVERVIEW": "The Lismas series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum weathered from clay shale on ridges and hills.  Permeability is very slow.  Slopes range from 3 to 100 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
