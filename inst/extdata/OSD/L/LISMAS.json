  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lismas soils are gently sloping to very steep on crests of upland ridges.  Slopes generally are convex and short to medium in length.  Slopes range from 3 to 100 percent.  This soil formed in clayey residuum weathered from shale.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 17 inches."

Hisle soils have a natric horizon.  Pierre soils have shale bedrock between depths of 20 to 40 inches and have Bw horizons.  Wasa and Winler soils have bedrock between a depth of 20 and 40 inches.  In addition, Wasa soils contain more salts.  Kyle, Swanboy, and Twotop are on foot slopes and terraces.  These soils have Bw horizons and shale bedrock is at depths greater than 40 inches."
