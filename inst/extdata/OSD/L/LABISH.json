    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 24 to 36 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from about 50 degrees to 55 degrees F.\nThe A and AC horizons have hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 1 through 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 to neutral. They have moderate to strong fine granular structure in the Ap1 horizon and moderate to weak coarse prismatic structure in the AC horizons. The organic matter in the epipedon is high ranging from about 10 to 25 percent and approaching a histic epipedon. Thin organic layers less than 4 inches thick occur below the Ap horizon in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bashaw, Chetco and Cove series. Bashaw soils are massive or have weak structure and have slickensides that intersect within the 10- to 40-inch control section. Brenner and Chetco soils lack epipedons that are more than 20 inches thick. Cove soils are slightly to medium acid, have mollic epipedons and have distinct cracks."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Labish soils are on level bottomlands or basins with impeded drainage. Elevations range from 100 to 200 feet.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 1 percent. The soils formed in mixed alluvial or lacustrine material high in organic matter and stratified with thin lenses less than 4 inches thick of peat or much and ranging to thicker peat deposits below 36 inches. The climate is humid temperate. The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches. The mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.; the average January temperature is 39 degrees F.; and the average July temperature is 67 degrees F. The frost-free season is 165 to 210 days."

Wapato soils have very dark brown A horizons and dark grayish brown moderately fine textured B2 horizons."
