  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "SRT; JLL; GRB",
  "REVDATE": "02/2008",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Los Penones series consists of very shallow, well drained, rapidly permeable soils on side slopes and stable ridge tops of the limestone outcrop hills and mountains of the Humid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  They formed in organic material overlying limestone.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 76 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 90 inches.  Slopes range from 60 to 90 percent.",
