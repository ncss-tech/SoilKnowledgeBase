The soil is saturated throughout for most of the year.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to the 2C horizon and thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches.  The upper part of the particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay and lower part has 0 to 5 percent clay.\nThe A1 horizon has value of  2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Organic matter content is 10 to 20 percent.  It contains 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe A2 and A3 horizons has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is ashy loam, ashy sandy loam or ashy clay loam with 0 to 10 percent gravel and 15 to 30 percent clay.  It has 10 to 30 percent glass.  Acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.3 to 0.7.\nThe 2C horizon has value 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  It is loamy sand or sand and contains 40 to 70 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobbles."

The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches, the mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F, and the frost-free period is 10 to 70 days."
