  "OVERVIEW": "The Luckybutte series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium and volcanic ash.  Luckybutte soils are on stream terraces and flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The upper part of the particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay and lower part has 0 to 5 percent clay.\nThe A1 horizon has value of  2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Organic matter content is 10 to 20 percent.  It contains 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe A2 and A3 horizons has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is ashy loam, ashy sandy loam or ashy clay loam with 0 to 10 percent gravel and 15 to 30 percent clay.  It has 10 to 30 percent glass.  Acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.3 to 0.7.\nThe 2C horizon has value 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  It is loamy sand or sand and contains 40 to 70 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobbles."
