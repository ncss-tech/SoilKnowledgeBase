  "OVERVIEW": "The Ledumhill series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in organic material over alluvium, slope alluvium, and till derived from granitic rocks. The Ledumhill soils are on seeps on glacial valley floors, mountain slopes, and basins of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 985 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.",
