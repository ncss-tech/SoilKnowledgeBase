  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to cemented caliche ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Gilgai microrelief is indistinct but slickensides are few to common.  When dry the soil has cracks ranging from 0.5 to 2 inches wide that stay open for 90 or more cumulative days in most years.  Coarse fragments consist of chert, limestone, and caliche pebbles and cobbles.  Surface fragments of chert range from 1 to 10 percent.\nThe A and Bw/A horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Clay content ranges from 30 to 55 percent.  Coarse fragments range from 1 to 15 percent by volume.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw and Bss horizons have hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is clay with a clay content of 60 to 75 percent.  Coarse fragments range from 1 to 15 percent by volume.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is very stony clay, gravelly clay, very gravelly clay, or cobbly clay with clay content of 60 to 75 percent.  Coarse fragments range from 1 to 60 percent by volume.   Most fragments appear to be remnants of a degraded petrocalcic horizon.  Reaction is slightly to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bkm horizon is indurated or strongly cemented in the upper part and weakly to strongly cemented in the lower part.  Limestone and chert pebbles, cobbles, and stones make up 20 to 70 percent of the volume."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other competing series in the same family.  Similar soils include the Anhalt, Campwood, Crawford, Depalt, San Saba, Tobosa and Topia series.  These soils do not have a petrocalcic horizon within 40 inches, do not have more than 60 percent clay in the control section.  Crawford and San Saba soils have hard limestone bedrock within 40 inches.  Topia soils do not have slickensides.  Anhalt soils lack a petrocalcic horizon and have soft limestone bedrock substrata."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Leakey soils are on high terraces in deeply incised valleys.  They formed in highly weathered Pleistocene age alluvium derived from areas of cherty Segovia Limestone (Lower Cretaceous) and Glenrose Limestone.  Slope gradients are mainly less than 3 percent but range from 0 to 5 percent.  The climate is subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 32 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 69 degrees F.  Frost-free days range from 220 to 240 and elevation ranges from 1,000 to 2,000 feet.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from about 36 to 44."

Eckrant, Kerrville, Oplin, and Real soils occur on erosional uplands higher in the landscape.  These soils are underlain by hard limestone bedrock within 20 inches.  Mailtrail and Mereta soils are on similar landscapes, and have a petrocalcic horizon within 20 inches.  Dev and Oakalla series are loamy soils on lower floodplain landscapes."
