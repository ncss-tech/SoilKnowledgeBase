  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lacota series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils that formed in loamy deposits underlain by sandy materials. Lacota soils are on lake plains, outwash plains, and glacial drainageways. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",
