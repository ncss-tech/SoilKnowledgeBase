  "OVERVIEW": "The Linveldt series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in a mantle of water worked sediments over calcareous loamy glacial till.  These soils primarily are on glacial lake plains. Permeability is moderately rapid or rapid in the upper part and moderate in the underlying till.  These soils have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 41 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 23 inches.",
