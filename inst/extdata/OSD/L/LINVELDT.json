  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 14 inches thick.  Carbonates are typically below the Bt horizon, but can be present in the lower part of the Bt horizon.  Depth to loamy glacial till ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The till has more than 18 percent clay.  The upper mantle has 2 to 15 percent rock fragments.  The 2Bw horizon has 0 to 35 percent rock fragments, and the 3C horizon has 2 to 15 percent rock fragments.  The soil moisture control section is not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days in most years.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and 4 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have an E horizon as much as 3 inches thick.  It has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.  Some pedons have thin subhorizons of sandy clay loam.  It has few to many, thin or moderately thick clay films and patches on faces of peds and in pores.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The fine earth fraction is fine sand, sand, coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  It has a thin zone with as much as 35 percent gravel at the contact with the loamy material at the base of the horizon in some pedons.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 3Bk and 3C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  They have common or many, distinct or prominent redoximorphic features.  They are slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.  The 3Bk and 3C horizons formed in Des Moines till and have textures of loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  They have 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser sand.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 25 percent.  Moist bulk density ranges from 1.35 to 1.60 g/cc."

They formed in 20 to 40 inches of water worked sediments over loamy glacial till.  These materials are of late Wisconsin age.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 24 inches. Frost-free season is 100 to 135 days.  Elevation is 800 to 1000 feet above sea level."

Kratka and Smiley soils have a wet soil moisture status withing 0.5 feet of the surface at some time during the period of April through July and are in concave, wetter positions.  Pelan soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the B horizon and are on similar positions as Linveldt soils.  Reiner soils have more clay in the B horizon and are on similar position in the landscape."
