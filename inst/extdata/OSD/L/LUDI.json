  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ludi soils are on cinder cones. They typically occur on backslope positions. These soils formed in eolian material derived from volcanic ash and colluvium derived from basalt over basaltic cinders. The source of the volcanic ash is ancestral Mt. Mazama. Slopes are 15 to 65 percent. Elevations range from 1,345 to 1,830 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation dominantly is 300 to 460 mm but in some areas may range from 250 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free period is 40 to 80 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bluesters, Glencabin, Henkle, and Wanoga soils. Bluesters soils are ashy over pumiceous or cindery, have andic soil properties, and are on more moist areas of cinder cones. Glencabin soils are ashy-skeletal, moderately deep to lithic contacts, and are on adjacent buttes and hills. Henkle soils are ashy-skeletal, shallow to lithic contacts, have andic soil properties, and occur on adjacent hills and plateaus. Wanoga soils are ashy, moderately deep to paralithic contacts, have andic soil properties, and occur on adjacent hills and plateaus."
