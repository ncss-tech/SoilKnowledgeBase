  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to rock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction of the A and Bt horizons ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid except for A horizons that have been limed.  Reaction of the Btss and BC horizons range from slightly acid to neutral.  The average clay content of the control section ranges from 60 to 75 percent.  Fragments of limestone range from 0 to 35 percent in the A or Ap horizon and from 0 to 15 percent in the Bt, Btss, and BC horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2, 3 or 4.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam or loam, but ranges to silty clay loam or silty clay in pedons that are eroded.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4, 6 or 8.  Texture is silty clay or clay. Mottles in shades of brown and red range from none to common.   Some pedons may have thin transitional horizons with texture of silty clay loam.\nThe Btss horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4, 6 or 8.  Black manganese concretions range from none to common.  In some pedons redoximorphic features of chroma 2 or less are below 20 inches from the top of the B horizon.  Mottles in shades of brown and red range from none to common.  Texture is clay.\nThe BC and C horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3, 4, 6 or 8. Redoximorphic features range from none to common and are in shades of brown, red, and gray. Concretions of calcium carbonate range from few to common.  Concretions and soft masses of iron and manganese oxides range from few to common.  Texture is clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lyerly soils are on nearly level to moderately steep uplands in the Southern Appalachian Ridges and Valleys Major Land Resource Area.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  The soil formed in residuum weathered from argillaceous limestone and shaly limestone.  The upper few inches of some pedons formed in a thin layer of local colluvium.  Limestone outcrops and ledges are characteristic of some areas of the soil.  Near the type location the mean annual temperature is about 60 to 65 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 45 to 55 inches."
