  "REVDATE": "02/2000",
  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lagross series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in water-sorted material dominated by shale fragments.  They are nearly level to moderately steep permeable soils on alluvial fans and outwash terraces.  Lagross soils typically have dark brown shaly silt loam A horizons, brown shaly and very shaly silt loam B horizons and dark brown very shaly silt loam C horizons.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 26 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments dominated by shale range from 15 to 60 percent in the A horizon and upper part of the B horizon, and from 35 to 70 percent in the lower part of the B and the C horizons.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid in the A and B horizons and from strongly acid through slightly acid in the C horizon.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Consistence is friable or firm."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the tentative Moberg and Wausau series in the same family.  The lower part of the solum and substratum of Moberg soils is weathered granite with loamy sand or coarser fine earth textures.  Wausau soils are underlain by weathered granite at depths of 40 to 60 inches."
