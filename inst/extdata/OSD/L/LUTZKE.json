    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Conotton, Dorerton,  Hawksbill, Leoni, Oakhill, and Silverwood series. Conotton soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size comtrol section.  Dorerton soils have a lithic contact within depths of 114 to 178 cm (45 to 70 inches) and  have only dolostone and limestone rock fragments. Hawksbill soils do not have a sandy-skeletal C horizon within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Leoni soils do not have free carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Oakhill soils have a lithic contact at 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches), have only basalt rock fragments, and do not have carbonates. Silverwood soils are more than 102 cm (40 inches) deep to the base of the argillic horizon and to carbonates."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lutzke soils typically are on outwash plains, stream terraces, eskers, kames, and moraines of Wisconsinan age.  Slope ranges from  2 to 20 percent.  Lutzke soils formed in loamy deposits over calcareous sand and gravel.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 838 mm (28 to 33 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.2 to 8.9 degrees C (45 to 48 degrees F)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Boyer, Casco, Gilford, Lorenzo, Rodman, and Wasepi soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Wasepi soils and poorly drained Gilford soils form a drainage sequence with the Lutzke soils.  Other nearby soils on similar topography are the Boyer, Casco, Lorenzo, and Rodman soils.  Boyer soils are coarse-loamy.  Lorenzo soils have a mollic epipedon and are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the subsoil and very high (141.14 or more micrometers per second) in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the subsoil and very rapid in the substratum."
