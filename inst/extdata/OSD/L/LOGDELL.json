  "OVERVIEW": "The Logdell series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from shale.  Logdell soils are on hillsides.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the control section for 60 to 80 consecutive days during the four-month period following the summer solstice.  The solum is slightly acid or neutral.  Depth to fractured shale ranges from 4 to 12 inches.  The solum has glass content of 10 to 30 percent.  Acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.3 to 0.7 percent.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue but ranges to 7.5YR.  It has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is ashy loam with 18 to 27 percent clay.  It has 35 to 70 percent shale fragments with 0 to 10 percent flagstones and 35 to 60 percent channers.  Base saturation by sum is 65 to 75 percent.\nThe R horizon is fractured shale.  Some fines are in fractures and voids in upper few inches only."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Logdell soils are on hillsides.  Elevations are 3,500 to 5,500 feet on north slopes but can range up to 6,600 feet on south slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  They were dominantly formed in shaly colluvium and residuum weathered from finely fractured shale interbedded in places with sandstone and graywacke.  Less common are Logdell soils formed in highly fractured, flaggy and channery rhyolite.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 17 to 22 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F., the mean July temperature is about 63 degrees F., and the mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 30 to 80 days."

McGarr soils are fine-loamy and 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Piersonte soils are deep.  Tolo soils are deep and are ashy over loamy."
