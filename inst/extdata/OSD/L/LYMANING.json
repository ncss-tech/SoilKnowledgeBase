(Bw horizon); Thin section study did not indicate any illuvial clay in this horizon.\nSecondary calcium carbonate accumulation: The zone from 12 to 26 inches. (Bk1, Bk2 horizons)\nParalithic contact:  The contact with shale at 26 inches. (Cr layer)\nThe 11/2009 revision changes the classification from Ustollic Haplocryalfs to Ustic Haplocryolls. Thin section analysis did not identify any illuvial clay in the Bw horizon. This horizon was originally described with \"common faint clay films on face of peds\".\nTaxonomic Version:  Eleventh Edition Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This pedon was sampled for the National Soil Survey laboratory, soil survey sample number 88CO-119-004.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
