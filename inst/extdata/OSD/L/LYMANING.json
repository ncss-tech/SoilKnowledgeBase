  "OVERVIEW": "The Lymaning series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium from tuff and shale.  Lymaning soils are on pediments.  Slopes range from 6 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

(Bk1, Bk2 horizons)\nParalithic contact:  The contact with shale at 26 inches. (Cr layer)\nThe 11/2009 revision changes the classification from Ustollic Haplocryalfs to Ustic Haplocryolls. Thin section analysis did not identify any illuvial clay in the Bw horizon.
