  "OVERVIEW": "The Lymaning series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium from tuff and shale.  Lymaning soils are on pediments.  Slopes range from 6 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

(Bw horizon); Thin section study did not indicate any illuvial clay in this horizon.\nSecondary calcium carbonate accumulation: The zone from 12 to 26 inches. (Bk1, Bk2 horizons)\nParalithic contact:  The contact with shale at 26 inches. (Cr layer)\nThe 11/2009 revision changes the classification from Ustollic Haplocryalfs to Ustic Haplocryolls. Thin section analysis did not identify any illuvial clay in the Bw horizon. This horizon was originally described with \"common faint clay films on face of peds\".\nTaxonomic Version:  Eleventh Edition Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010."
