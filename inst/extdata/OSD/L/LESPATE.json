    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature ranges from 44 to 49 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is clay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam with clay ranging from 24 to 35 percent.  Coarse fragments range from 5 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section with the dominant being less than 3 inches in diameter.  The A and Bw horizons are neutral to mildly alkaline.  Hard bedrock is at depths of 20 to 40 inches below the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 3 to 5, 1 or 2 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe Bw horizon not definitive for cambic, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 through 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe Bk or C horizons have hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, values of 4 through 6, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Depth to accumulation of calcium carbonate ranges from 14 to 24 inches.  Rock fragments often have calcium carbonate coatings as pendants."

Adel, Bullbasin, Bullrey, Duff, Hackwood, Idmon, Lamphier, Leavittville, Mundos, Osmund, Pavohroo, Rhone and Taterheap soils all lack bedrock above 40 inches.  Gallatin soils have sand and gravel in the substratum.   Karlan soils are formed in thin loess layer over residuum from rhyolite or rhyolitic tuff and have less than 27 percent clay in their particle-size control section.  Secondset soils are slightly acid and lack a k horizon.  Winevada soils lack k horizons.   Strickland soils are slightly acid to strongly acid and lack carbonate above the bedrock."

The soils formed in residuum and colluvium from limestone and interbedded sandstone.  Elevation ranges from 8,400 to 9,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches, the majority of which is received as snow.  Mean annual temperature is 36 to 42 degrees F."
