  "REVDATE": "06/2004",
  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lynne series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on flats of Central Florida.  They formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 59 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe E'g horizon, where present, is less than 6 inches thick.  It has the same range in colors and textures as the Eg horizon.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Redoximorphic accumulations in shades of brown, yellow, and red range from few to many.  Texture is sandy clay.  Some pedons have thin layers, less than 8 inches thick, with textures of sandy clay loam or clay loam."

In addition, Adamsville soils do not have argillic or spodic horizons and are sandy throughout while Electra soils have spodic horizons more than 30 inches below the surface and argillic horizons more than 37 inches.  The very poorly or poorly drained Myakka soils are on similar positions, have spodic horizons more than 30 inches below the surface, and do not have argillic horizons.  The very poorly or poorly drained Pomona soils are on lower positions and have argillic horizons more than 37 inches below the surface.  The moderately well drained Tavares soils are on higher positions, do not have spodic or argillic horizons, and are sandy throughout."
