The somewhat poorly drained Adamsville and Electra soils are on slightly higher positions.  In addition, Adamsville soils do not have argillic or spodic horizons and are sandy throughout while Electra soils have spodic horizons more than 30 inches below the surface and argillic horizons more than 37 inches.  The very poorly or poorly drained Myakka soils are on similar positions, have spodic horizons more than 30 inches below the surface, and do not have argillic horizons.  The very poorly or poorly drained Pomona soils are on lower positions and have argillic horizons more than 37 inches below the surface.  The moderately well drained Tavares soils are on higher positions, do not have spodic or argillic horizons, and are sandy throughout."
