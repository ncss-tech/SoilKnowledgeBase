  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 12 to 24 inches.  The thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  The upper sediment typically does not have coarse fragments, but in some pedons it contains up to 2 percent, by volume, at the contact with the lower till.  The underlying glacial till contains 2 to 10 percent, by volume, of coarse fragments of mixed lithology.  The reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.  The calcic horizon is within depths of 16 inches and has 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  The series control section has 18 to 35 percent clay.  Concentrations of gypsum crystals are in some pedons, but they are not diagnostic for the series.  The soil moisture control section is dry for 20 to 35 consecutive days during the 120 days that follow the summer solstice.\nThe A, Ap and Ak horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y or are neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2.  They are silty clay loam or silt loam.\nThe Bkg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Pedons with chroma of 2 have distinct or prominent Fe concentrations.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Carbonates generally are typically disseminated throughout the matrix, but some pedons have a few threads or masses.\nThe Cg and 2Cg horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 through 3.  The Cg horizon is silt loam and may have thin strata of very fine sandy loam or loamy very fine sand.  The 2Cg horizon is loam or clay loam."

The Chipman, Logan and Provo Bay soils have a soil moisture control section that is dry for more than 35 consecutive days during the 120 days that follow the summer solstice.  Harpster and Prophetstown soils have a soil moisture control section that is dry for less than 20 consecutive days during the 120 days that follow the summer solstice in most years."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils have plane or slightly concave slopes with gradient of 0 to 2 percent on glacial till plains or ground moraines.  The Leen soils formed in 24 to 40 inches of silty lacustrine sediments or loess overlying calcareous loam or clay loam glacial till.  The sediments are Late Wisconsinan in age.  Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 22 to 26 inches.   Frost free days range from 120 to 160.  Elevation above sea level is 1000 to 1500 feet."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Crooksford, Louris and Okoboji soils which formed in similar sediments and the Swanlake soils which formed entirely in glacial till.  They are members of the same hydrosequence with the Leen soils.  The Crooks and Swanlake soils are well drained and are on more sloping positions.  The Louris soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on slightly higher positions.  Okoboji soils are very poorly drained and are in depressions"
