  "OVERVIEW": "The Libuse series consist of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in a silty mantle of loess or mixed loess and coastal plain sediments over coastal plain sediments. These soils are nearly level to strongly sloping terraces. Slope ranges from 1 to 12 percent, but are dominantly 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (65 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1536 mm (60.5 in)",
