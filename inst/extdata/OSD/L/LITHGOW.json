  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 to 53 degrees F. (estimated).  Lithgow soils are usually dry but are moist in some part between depths of 4 and 12 inches for a continuous period equal to more than one quarter of the time that the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F., and moist between depths of 4 and 12 inches for at least 60 days out of the 120 days following the 3-month period following the summer solstice.  The amount of pebbles ranges from 20 to 30 inches thick and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The sola are noncalcareous throughout and are neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is gravelly or stony loam or clay loam, and has weak or moderate platy and granular structure.\nThe B2 horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is gravelly or very gravelly clay loam with a weighted average of 27 to 35 percent clay, and has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure.  Clay films are few to common and thin."

Basket soils have mean annual soil temperature of less than 47 degrees F., and also have coarse textured calcic horizons.  Old Camp soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches.  Searles soils have mollic epipedon.  Washoe and Plush soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lithgow soils are on hilly and mountainous areas at elevations of 2,000 to 3,300 feet.  The soils are mostly on south-facing slopes of 20 to about 70 percent.  These soils formed in mixed loess and colluvium and old unconsolidated moderately fine textured sediments over tuffs, rhyolite or semiconsolidated sediments.  The climate is semiarid continental with a mean annual precipitation of 9 to 10 inches.  Average July temperature is about 68 degrees F.  Mean winter temperature is about 32 degrees F.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 51 degrees F.  The average frost-free period (32 degrees F.) is 80 to 110 days."
