  "OVERVIEW": "The Leeper series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium.  Leeper soils are on flood plains of the Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas Blackland Prairie. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1400 millimeters (55 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C (64 degrees F).",
