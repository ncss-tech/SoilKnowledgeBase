Elevations range from 2,000 to 5,400 feet.  The climate is semiarid or subhumid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 20 inches with a seasonal snowfall of 8 to 36 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 34 degrees F., the mean July temperature is about 68 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.
