  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum and coarse-loamy mantle range from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 14 to 24 inches in thickness.  The sola typically lack gravel, but a few pedons contain as much as 5 percent fine gravel of mixed lithology.  The control section has less than 18   percent clay and the percent of silt and very fine sand plus twice the percent of clay exceeds 30 percent.  These soils typically are mildly or moderately alkaline throughout. The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or is N 2/0 or N 3/0.  It is loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2 with hue of 2.5Y or 1 through 3 with hue of 5Y.  It has few through many, faint through prominent mottles.  It is loam,  sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam in the upper part, and loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam in the lower part.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y.  It typically is sand, but it ranges to coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand.  It contains as much as 35 percent gravel in some pedons and a gravelly substratum is allowed.  Some pedons have a loamy 3C horizon below 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lemond soils have plane or slightly convex slopes with gradient of 0 to 2 percent on rims of depressions and broad flats on glacial outwash plains, valley trains, and lacustrine plains.  They formed in glacial outwash or lacustrine sediments consisting of a loamy mantle and underlying sandy sediments.  The sediments are Late Wisconsinan in age.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 27 to 32 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dickman and Hanska soils which are members of a hydrosequence with the Lemond soils.  The somewhat excessively drained Dickman soils are on higher lying or more sloping terrain.  The poorly drained Hanska soils are on nearby level terrain.  Lemond soils are associated with Dickinson and Estherville soils and their respective associates in some places."
