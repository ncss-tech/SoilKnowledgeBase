  "OVERVIEW": "The Lamont series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in eolian deposits.  These soils are on uplands, transverse dunes, and high stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (about 49 degrees F).  Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters (about 32 inches).",
