  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a calcic horizon is 20 to 30 inches and calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 30 percent.  Depth to stratification is 40 to 59 inches.  The mean annual temperature at depth of about 20 inches is about 65 degrees F. and the temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F. at any time.  The soil from 11 to 29 inches is usually dry and is not continuously moist for as long as 60 days. The control section averages sandy loam or loam with 8 to 18 percent clay and less than 30 percent fine or very fine sand.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 6/3, 7/3, 7/4 dry; 10YR 4/3, 5/3, 5/4 moist.  It is loamy sand or loamy fine sand and has about 5 to 10 percent fine gravel. Structure ranges from weak to moderate, fine to coarse, subangular blocky or platy. Reaction is typically moderately alkaline but ranges to slightly alkaline. This horizon is generally strongly effervescent, carbonates disseminated but small areas are slightly effervescent.\nThe Bw horizon is 7.5YR 5/4 and 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 7/3, 7/4, 8/2, 8/3 dry; 7.5YR 4/4 and 10YR 4/2, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3 moist.  Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand with 4 to 8 percent clay.\nThe Bk horizon is 2.5Y 7/2, 5/4 and 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3, 8/2, 8/4 dry; 2.5Y 5/2, 5/4, 6/2, 6/4, 7/2, 7/4 and 10YR 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 7/4, 7/6 moist.  Texture is loam or sandy loam with 5 to 10 percent fine gravel by weighted average.  There are 20 to 30 percent lime nodules or concretions.  Most pedons are weakly cemented in some part of the calcic horizon but cementation is not continuous.  Other pedons are hard or very hard but soften appreciably upon wetting.\nThe 2Bk horizon has similar colors as the Bk horizons but lacks concretions and nodules. Textures are stratified loamy sand to sand with 5 to 10 percent gravels and 0 to 7 percent clay."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Algerita (NM), Grapevine (NV), Kinley (AZ), Latene (NM), Nikey (UT), Rillino (AZ), Whitlock (AZ) and Wink (TX) series.  Algerita soils have a moisture control section that is moist for 30 to 40 days cumulative in July, August and September.  Grapevine soils have a prismatic B2 horizon and a calcic horizon at depths of 5 to 10 inches and have gypsum in the substratum.  Kinley soils are intermittently moist during the summer.  Latene soils have a calcic horizon at a depth of less than 20 inches and have more than 30 percent fine or very fine sand.  Nikey soils dominantly have hue of 5YR throughout.  Rillino soils have 20 to 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Whitlock soils have sand or loamy sand in the lower part of their control section.  Wink soils are strongly cemented in the C horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lavic soils are on fan piedmonts, alluvial fans and basin rims and have slopes of 0 to 9 percent. They formed in mixed alluvium derived mainly from granitic sources. Elevations are 2,400 to 3,200 feet. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool somewhat moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 4 or 5 inches, most of the moisture occurring as rain in late autumn and winter. Some moisture falls occasionally as snow. The mean annual temperature is 61 to 63 degrees F; the average January temperature is about 44 degrees F.; and the average July temperature is about 83 degrees F. The frost free season is 190 to 255 days."
