  "OVERVIEW": "The Lycurgus series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on footslopes in uplands.  They formed in 2 to 4 feet of loamy sediments over loess.  Slopes range from 9 to 25 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches.",

The lower part contains less than 10 percent sand.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry,  and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is silt loam, but loam is within the range.\nThe Bt and 2Bt horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam with the finest part of the Bt horizon averaging between 27 and 35 percent clay.  A few fine faint mottles of either high or low chroma are present in the  lower part.\nThe C horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR with value and chroma of 4 to 6."

Ashdale and Dodgeville soils have the lower part of the solum formed in residuum weathered from limestone and have limestone at depths of 3 to 5 feet.  Assumption soils have a paleosol in glacial till within a depth of 40 inches.  Barrington soils have carbonates at shallower depths.  Broadwell soils have loamy sand or sand at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Catlin, Dana, Dinsdale, Mendota, Ogle, Saybrook, and Sidell soils have glacial till at a depth of less than 60 inches.  Cotter, Reading, Sibley, and Troxel soils have a mollic epipedon thicker than 24 inches.  Douglas soils have glacial till at depths of 3 1/2 to 7 feet.  Elkhart soils have thinner sola and are shallower to carbonates.  Elmont and Keltner soils have shale C horizons and thinner sola.  Harrison soils have a thinner mollic epipedon, have a gray E horizon.  Healing soils have lower clay content in the B horizon.  Malcolm soils have a thinner solum and are in areas with less precipitation.  Plano, Proctor, Richwood, and Toddville soils all have more sand in their lower sola.  Ripon soils have limestone bedrock within 40 inches.  Tama soils have less sand in the upper 2 to 4 feet of the soil.  Waupecan soils have beta B horizons in sandy and gravelly outwash.  Wiota soils have thicker mollic epipedons, less contrast between the A and B horizons in amount of clay and more variable coarse silt-fine silt ratios in the sola."

Slope gradient ranges from 9 to 25 percent.  Lycurgus soils formed in 2 to 4 feet of loamy sediments over loess.  The loamy sediment is derived from loess and sandy bedrock residuum.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 29 to 38 inches."

The Arenzville, Chaseburg, and Eitzen soils are in narrow drainageways below the Lycurgus soils.  The Downs, Tama, and Valton soils are on less-sloping ridgetops and side slopes below the Lycurgus soils.  Boone and Lacrescent soils are on steeper side slopes above the Lycurgus soils.  The Churchtown soils form a biosequence with the Lycurgus soils and are on similar landscape positions."
