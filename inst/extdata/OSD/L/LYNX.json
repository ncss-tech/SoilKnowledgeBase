Bon, Draper, Humbarger, Shanta, St. Onge and Umbarg soils are calcareous throughout.  Draper and Pack soils have mottles at depths less than 40 inches. Frazwell soils have a stone line containing 40 to 55 percent rock fragments that overlies buried horizons.  Manzano soils have Bw horizons and segregated lime in the lower control section.  Maskell, Merrick and Mauricanyon soils are moist in the moisture control section during May and June."

Classification of this soil should be re-evaluated when the area is updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
