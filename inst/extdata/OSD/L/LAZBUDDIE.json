The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for more than 180 but less than 205 cumulative days in normal years. July through August and November through March are the driest months. These soils are intermittently moist in September through October and April through June; however, lower landscape positions result in higher \"effective\" precipitation.\nMean annual soil temperature: 15 to 18 degrees C (59 to 64 F).\nDepth to secondary calcium carbonate: 13 to 100 cm (5 to 40 in).\nDepth to calcic horizon: 100 to 150 cm (40 to 60 in).\nDepth to slickensides: 6 to 25 cm (2 to 10 in).\nLinear extensibility of top 1 meter (40 in): 7 to 10 cm (2.75 to 4 in).\nSolum thickness: more than 203 cm (80 in).\nParticle-size control section (weighted average): 40 to 60 percent silicate clay.\nThis is a cyclic soil and undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microhighs 13 to 46 cm (5 to 18 in) higher than microlows.

The microhigh makes up about 25 percent, the intermediate area between the high and low about 50 percent, and the microlow about 25 percent. Cracks open and close each year, except during higher than normal rainfall years, and remain open for 150 to 210 cumulative days during most years. When dry, 1.3 to 7.5 cm (0.5 to 3 in) wide cracks extends from the surface to a depth of 100 cm (40 in) or more. Cracks are more prominent in the microlow.
