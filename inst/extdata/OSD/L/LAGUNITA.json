  "OVERVIEW": "The Lagunita series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in stratified stream alluvium from mixed sources.  Lagunita soils are on flood plains and generally have slopes of 0 to 3 percent, but range to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F.",

Carsitas soils average 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Myoma soils have hue of 10YR or yellower and are not subject to flooding.  Pintobasin soils average more than 15 percent rock fragments, dominantly gravel, in the control section and are slightly acid to neutral throughout.  Rositas soils have less than 15 percent coarse and very coarse sand and are on sand dunes."

Mean annual precipitation is 2 to 10 inches, which occurs as summer thunderstorms and as gentle winter rains.  Mean annual air temperature ranges 69 to 76 degrees F.
