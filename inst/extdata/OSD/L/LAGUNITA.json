    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Carsitas (CA), Myoma (CA), Pintobasin (T)(CA), and Rositas (CA) series.  Carsitas soils average 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Myoma soils have hue of 10YR or yellower and are not subject to flooding.  Pintobasin soils average more than 15 percent rock fragments, dominantly gravel, in the control section and are slightly acid to neutral throughout.  Rositas soils have less than 15 percent coarse and very coarse sand and are on sand dunes."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lagunita soils are on flood plains and generally have slopes of 0 to 3 percent, but range to include 5 percent.  They formed in stratified stream alluvium from mixed sources.  Elevations are 75 to 1,400 feet.  The climate is hot, arid and continental.  Mean annual precipitation is 2 to 10 inches, which occurs as summer thunderstorms and as gentle winter rains.  Mean annual air temperature ranges 69 to 76 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 240 to 325 days."
