  "OVERVIEW": "The Lucito series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from latite and dacite. Lucito soils are on toeslopes and footslopes of mountains.  Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
