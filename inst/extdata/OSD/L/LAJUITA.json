  "STATES": "CO,NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lajuita series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  Lajuita soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.",
