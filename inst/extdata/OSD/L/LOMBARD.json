  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 27 inches.  Depth to the saprolite ranges from 20 to 34 inches.  Depth to bedrock is typically 60 to 72 inches.  Channer volume ranges from 0 to 25 percent in the solum, 20 to 50 percent in the C horizon, and 0 to 40 percent in the 2C horizon.  Gravel volume ranges from 0 to 10 percent in all horizons.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the solum, slightly acid to neutral in the C horizon, and is neutral in the 2C horizon.\nO horizons range from slightly to highly decomposed plant material.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nSome pedons have an E horizon that is neutral or has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam. It is up to 2 inches thick.\nThe Bw1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bw2 horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe 2C horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 0 to 4.  Texture of the hand crushed saprolite ranges from sandy loam to silt loam in the fine earth fraction.  The saprolite is derived from phyllite and schist and increases in rupture resistance and excavation difficulty with depth.\nSome pedons have a 2Cr horizon with cracks and bedding planes that roots can enter spaced less than 4 inches.  Color and texture is similar to the 2C horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lombard soils are undulating to very steep soils formed in a loamy mantle of glacial till over saprolite derived from the underlying soft bedrock of the Waits River Formation.  This bedrock is primarily dark gray or black phyllite, with inclusions of schist and micaceous quartzite.  Secondary carbonates coating channers and pebbles occur in some places.  The landscape is bedrock controlled and glacially modified.  Slopes are either simple or complex, range from 3 to 60 percent, and generally change smoothly and continuously across the landscape.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 37 to 45 inches, mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual growing season ranges from 90 to 110 days."

Bangor and Plaisted soils are on smooth sideslopes. Lyman and Tunbridge soils are on similar landforms.  Lyman soils are shallow to bedrock.  Tunbridge soils are moderately deep to bedrock."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  1. With this revision horizon designation is changed in layers from 28 to 64 inches from 2Cr to 2C to reflect the non-root restrictive nature of the material.  The designation R is changed to 2R.  The saprolite material associated with underlying variably weathered bedrock is interpreted to have weathered residually, independent of subsequent glacial deposition.  Estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity is added.\n2.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 7 inches (Oa and A horizon).\nb. Cambic horizon - the zone from 7 to 22 inches (Bw horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
