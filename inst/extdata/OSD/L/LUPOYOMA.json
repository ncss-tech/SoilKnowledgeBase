  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are dry between depths of 6 and 18 inches from June 1 to October 15, unless irrigated, and usually are moist from January 1 to April 15.  Depth to mottles ranges from 20 to 36 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature varies from 59 degrees to 61 degrees F.  The A horizon has 1 to 2 percent organic carbon that decreases irregularly with depth and is 20 to 30 inches thick.  The base saturation in the upper 75 cm is less than 75 percent.  The soil ranges from 18 to 35 percent clay with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser materials between a depth of 10 to 40 inches.  The soil has up to 1 percent charcoal particles 1 to 10 mm in diameter.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/3 or 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3 or 3/2.  It is silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam.  It is moderately acid through neutral.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 6/4, 6/3, 6/2, 5/3, 4/3, 4/2 or 2.5Y 6/2.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/6, 4/4; 10YR 4/2, 3/3, 3/2, 3/1, or 2.5Y 4/2.  It is very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.  Lenses of fine sandy loam or sandy loam also occur in this horizon below 40 inches.  This horizon is massive or has weak subangular blocky or prismatic structure.  It is slightly acid through slightly alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils are formed in alluvium weathered from mixed rock sources, dominantly sandstone and shale.  Elevations are 800 to 1,450 feet.  The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 40 inches.  The mean January temperature is 42 degrees F; the mean July temperature is 68 degrees F; and mean the mean annual temperature is 55 to 59 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 150 to 205 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Lab sampled 9/79 for organic carbon and base saturation.  Lab sample numbers from Lincoln Lab (7822598-2603).\nOrganic carbon in the mollic epipedon (0 to 31 inches) ranged from 1.08 to 2.10 percent.  Below 31 inches the O.C. decreased irregularly with depth.  Base saturation (by sum of cations) in the A1 and A2 horizons was 69 percent.  The proposed classification of Cumulic Ultic Haploxeroll is a change from the former classification of Mollic Xerofluvent.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in February of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
