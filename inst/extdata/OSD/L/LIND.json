  "OVERVIEW": "The Lind series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  Lind soils are on fan remnants and structural benches.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
