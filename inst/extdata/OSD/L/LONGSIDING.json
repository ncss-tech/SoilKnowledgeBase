    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils have slightly convex to slightly concave slopes on glacial lake plains.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent.  They formed in calcareous, clayey and silty lacustrine sediments of Late Wisconsin age.  These sediments are primarily derived from the Des Moines lobe. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 7 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 625 to 750 mm. Frost free days range from 90 to 140. Elevation above sea level ranges from 300 to 500 meters."
