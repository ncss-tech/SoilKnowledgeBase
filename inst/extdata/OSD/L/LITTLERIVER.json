  "OVERVIEW": "The Littleriver series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fluviomarine deposits. Littleriver soils are on marine terrace remnants on hillslopes and lower mountain slopes and have slopes of 9 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1650 millimeters (65 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).",
