  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev.JDS; JLD",
  "REVDATE": "02/2000",
  "STATES": "LA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Litro series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in acid, clayey alluvial sediments. They are on flood plains of the Ouachita River and its tributaries. Slopes are dominantly less than 1 percent, but range to 2 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 60 to 100 inches. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid except where the surface layer has been limed. Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid in more than half the thickness of the upper 20 inches.  The effective cation exchange capacity is 50 percent or more saturated with exchangeable aluminum in the control section to a depth of 30 inches or more. COLE values of the control section range from 0.09 to 0.13.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y; value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is typically clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam but some pedons have silt loam or coarser textured recent overwash.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1. Iron accumulations in shades of brown or yellow range from few to many. Texture is clay or silty clay.\nThe Bssg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 within a depth of 30 inches, and hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2 below a depth of 30 inches.  Iron accumulations in shades of brown or yellow range from few to many. Texture is clay or silty clay.\nThe B'g horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Iron accumulations in shades of brown or yellow range from few to many. Texture is clay or silty clay."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Series in similar families are the Alligator, Gladewater, Kobel, Leeper, Perry, Portland, Sharkey, Tamba, Tuscumbia, and Una series. Alligator, Gladewater, Kobel, Leeper, Perry, Portland, and Sharkey soils have smectitic mineralogy. In addition, Gladewater, Perry, Portland, and Sharkey soils have a very-fine, nonacid control section. Tamba and Una soils do not form cracks or slickensides. Kobel, Leeper, and Tuscumbia soils have a nonacid control section and do not form cracks or slickensides."

These soils formed in clayey alluvial sediments. Mean annual precipitation is 51 inches. Average annual temperature is 65 degrees F. near the type location."

Groom and Mollicy soils are on ridges at higher elevations and have a fine-silty control section. Guyton soils are at slightly higher elevations and have a fine-silty control section. Haggerty soils are on low terrace ridges, have a coarse-loamy control section, and are better drained."
