  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 60 to 100 inches. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid except where the surface layer has been limed. Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid in more than half the thickness of the upper 20 inches.  The effective cation exchange capacity is 50 percent or more saturated with exchangeable aluminum in the control section to a depth of 30 inches or more. COLE values of the control section range from 0.09 to 0.13.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y; value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is typically clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam but some pedons have silt loam or coarser textured recent overwash.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1. Iron accumulations in shades of brown or yellow range from few to many. Texture is clay or silty clay.\nThe Bssg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 within a depth of 30 inches, and hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2 below a depth of 30 inches.  Iron accumulations in shades of brown or yellow range from few to many. Texture is clay or silty clay.\nThe B'g horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Series in similar families are the Alligator, Gladewater, Kobel, Leeper, Perry, Portland, Sharkey, Tamba, Tuscumbia, and Una series. Alligator, Gladewater, Kobel, Leeper, Perry, Portland, and Sharkey soils have smectitic mineralogy. In addition, Gladewater, Perry, Portland, and Sharkey soils have a very-fine, nonacid control section. Tamba and Una soils do not form cracks or slickensides. Kobel, Leeper, and Tuscumbia soils have a nonacid control section and do not form cracks or slickensides."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Litro soils are on low, level to nearly level flood plains of the Ouachita River and its tributaries. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in clayey alluvial sediments. Mean annual precipitation is 51 inches. Average annual temperature is 65 degrees F. near the type location."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Perry soils, and Groom, Guyton, Haggerty, and Mollicy soils. Groom and Mollicy soils are on ridges at higher elevations and have a fine-silty control section. Guyton soils are at slightly higher elevations and have a fine-silty control section. Haggerty soils are on low terrace ridges, have a coarse-loamy control section, and are better drained."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of this soil is in woodland. Common trees include willow oak, water oak, overcup oak, baldcypress, water tupelo and persimmon. Areas that are protected from flooding are used for growing rice and soybeans."
