  "REVDATE": "04/2013",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lonniebee series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from interbedded sandstone,  shale or argillite.  These soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 4 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
