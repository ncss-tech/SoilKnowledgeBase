  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil contains 0 to 10 percent by volume pebbles or stones and a few boulders.\nThe A horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.  It typically is loam, but included are fine sandy loam, silt loam or clay loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loam or silt loam.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It has a chroma of 4 in the lower part of some pedons.  It typically is clay loam, but included are loam and silty clay loam.  It typically contains 25 to 30 percent clay but ranges from 18 to 35 percent.  It is neutral to strongly alkaline.  It has moderate or strong columnar or prismatic structure which parts to angular or subangular blocky structure in many pedons.  Some pedons have a Btk horizon.  Bty horizons are allowed below a depth of 16 inches.\nThe By, Bz and Bk horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  They are loam or clay loam.  They are moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  The Bk horizon contains 10 to 25 percent calcium carbonate disseminated or in masses, but has 15 percent in some part.  The By and Bz horizons contain few to many gypsum or salt crystals.  Some pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is loam, but it is silt loam or clay loam in some pedons.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  It is stratified and has layers of coarser or finer textures below 40 inches in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Larson soils are on level to undulating till plains.  Slope commonly is less than 3 percent, but ranges to 15 percent.   The soils formed in calcareous, glacial till containing pockets of silt, fine sand and other sorted materials.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 15 to 20 inches.  Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cathay Emrick, Fram, Heimdal, Miranda, Parnell, Swenoda and Tonka soils.  Cathay and Miranda soils are on similar landscapes with Larson soils.  Cathay soils have tonguing or interfingering of albic materials into the Btn horizon.  Miranda soils have visible salt crystals within 16 inches of the surface.  Emrick, Fram, Heimdal and Swenoda soils are on nearby till plains.  They are in complex with Larson soils in some areas.  They do not have natric horizons.  In addition, Fram soils have calcic horizons within depth of 16 inches.  Parnell and Tonka soils are in depressions.  They are very poorly and poorly drained, respectively.  In addition, they do not have natric horizons and are fine."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well and somewhat poorly drained.   Runoff ranges from negligible to medium depending on slope.  Permeability is slow in the Btn horizons and moderately slow or moderate in the C horizon.  A seasonal high water table is at a depth of 2 to 4 feet at some time during the period of April through June in the somewhat poorly drained phase and at a depth of 3 to 5 feet at some time for the same period in the moderately well drained phase."
