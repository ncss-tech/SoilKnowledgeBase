  "OVERVIEW": "The Lalos series consist of deep, well drained soils on aeolian deposits eroded from lacustrine sediments.  Lalos soils are on aeolian lakeshore dunes and have slopes of 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The soil between the depths of 8 to 24 inches is dry in all parts from June 15 until November 10 (145 days).  The moisture control section is dry more than half the time; the soil temperature is more than 41 degrees F.  In the 10 to 40 inch control section there is 10 to 15 percent fine sand or coarser.

The ratio of 15-bar water content to measured clay is 1.0 to 2.45.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/1, 6/2 or 6/3 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/3 and 5/3.  E.C. ranges from 0 to 4.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are: Ochric epipedon--The zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 13 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nCambic horizon--The zone from about 13 to 30 inches (Bw1, Bw2).  Permeability is slow because the soil has high exchangeable sodium and is massive.  Bw1 has an exchangeable sodium content of 49 percent.  Bw2 has an exchangeable sodium content of 64 percent.  Have strong chroma, redder hue less carbonates than the underlying horizon.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated."
