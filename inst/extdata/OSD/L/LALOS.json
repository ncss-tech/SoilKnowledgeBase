    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth of aeolian material is greater than 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 degrees to 52 degrees F.  The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F from about March 15 to December 1 (255 days) and is above 47 degrees F from about April 15 to November 15 (210 days).  The soil between the depths of 8 to 24 inches is dry in all parts from June 15 until November 10 (145 days).  The moisture control section is dry more than half the time; the soil temperature is more than 41 degrees F.  In the 10 to 40 inch control section there is 10 to 15 percent fine sand or coarser. The bulk density ranges from 0.9 to 1.0.  The NaF pH ranges from 9.9 to 11.0.  The ratio of 15-bar water content to measured clay is 1.0 to 2.45.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/1, 6/2 or 6/3 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/3 and 5/3.  E.C. ranges from 0 to 4.  ESP ranges from 10 to 40.\nThe Bn horizon has dry color of 10YR 7/2, 7/5YR 7/3 or 7/2 and moist color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 6/3, or 6/4.  The exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 49 to 64.  This horizon contains no clay films.  E.C. ranges from 4 to 8.  ESP ranges from 49 to 64.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/2, 6/3, or 7/3 and moist color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 3/4, 4/4, or 6/3.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are: Ochric epipedon--The zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 13 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nCambic horizon--The zone from about 13 to 30 inches (Bw1, Bw2).  Permeability is slow because the soil has high exchangeable sodium and is massive.  Bw1 has an exchangeable sodium content of 49 percent.  Bw2 has an exchangeable sodium content of 64 percent.  Have strong chroma, redder hue less carbonates than the underlying horizon.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Soil was sampled in August 1980 by Lincoln Laboratory.  Pedon No. S80CA-093-020.  Samples from the Bw1 and Bw2 were tested by the Lincoln Lab and showed no evidence of illuvial clay.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
