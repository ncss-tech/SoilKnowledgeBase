  "OVERVIEW": "The Luton series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils formed in clayey alluvium. These soils are on flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 71 centimeters (28 inches).",
