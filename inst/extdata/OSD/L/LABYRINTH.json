  "OVERVIEW": "The Labyrinth series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, rapidly permeable soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone.  Labyrinth soils are on canyon floors and flood plains.  Slopes are 2 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
