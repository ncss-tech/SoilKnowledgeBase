  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; high runoff; very slow saturated hydraulic conductivity in the Ap, Bssg and Bkssg horizons, slow in the Bkg horizon, moderately slow in the 2Bkq horizon and impermeable in the 2Bkqm horizon.  The soils are rarely to occasionally flooded for very brief to brief periods from December through March.  A fluctuating water table can occur between the top of the duripan and the surface of the soil from December through May.  Water frequently ponds up to 6 inches, (15 cm) above the surface for long duration from December through April.  Dams, levees, drainage ditches, and leveling for agriculture have modified the frequency and duration of saturation, ponding and flooding."
