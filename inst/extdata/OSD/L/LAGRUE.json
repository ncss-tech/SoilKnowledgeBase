The parent material is mainly aluvium, but some areas may have been mixed with loess. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Lagrue soils formed in clayey sediments deposited by the Mississippi River and its tributaries. Climate is warm and humid. Mean annual temperature ranges from about 62 to 66 degrees F. Average annual precipitation ranges from about 50 to 55 inches."
