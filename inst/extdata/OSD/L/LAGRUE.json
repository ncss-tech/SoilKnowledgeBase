  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lagrue soils are on level to slightly concave areas on Pleistocene Prairie terraces. These areas are thought to be old abandoned river channels and courses. The parent material is mainly aluvium, but some areas may have been mixed with loess. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Lagrue soils formed in clayey sediments deposited by the Mississippi River and its tributaries. Climate is warm and humid. Mean annual temperature ranges from about 62 to 66 degrees F. Average annual precipitation ranges from about 50 to 55 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dewitt and Stuttgart series. Dewitt and Stuttgart soils occur on adjacent higher landscapes, and have abrupt texture changes between the ochric epipedon and the argillic horizon. Stuttgart soils are in a udic moisture regime."
