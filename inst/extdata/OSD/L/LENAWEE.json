Brookston soils formed in loamy till, are poorly drained, and occupy low lying areas. Brookston soils are also found on lake plains in MLRA 99 where the lacustrine sediments are thin. Celina, Miami, and Morley soils are moderately well drained and occupy nearly level to undulating positions on the landscape. Fox soils are well drained and have a gravelly substratum. Colwood soils have a mollic epipedon. Del Rey soils are somewhat poorly drained and, along with the moderately well drained Shinrock soils, form a drainage sequence with Lenawee soils. Toledo soils have illitic mineralogy, and Hoytville and Ziegenfuss soils are derived from till- these soils occupy landscape positions similar to Lenawee soils."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn, small grain, soybeans, and hay are the principal crops. A small part, especially areas where artificial drainage is not adequate for cultivation, is in permanent pasture or woodland. Native vegetation is hardwoods; chiefly American elm, white ash, red maple, and swamp white oak."
