  "OVERVIEW": "The Lenawee series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in lacustrine deposits. These soils are on lake plains and in depressions on moraines, outwash plains, and glacial drainageways. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 860 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Brookston soils formed in loamy till, are poorly drained, and occupy low lying areas. Brookston soils are also found on lake plains in MLRA 99 where the lacustrine sediments are thin. Celina, Miami, and Morley soils are moderately well drained and occupy nearly level to undulating positions on the landscape. Fox soils are well drained and have a gravelly substratum. Colwood soils have a mollic epipedon. Del Rey soils are somewhat poorly drained and, along with the moderately well drained Shinrock soils, form a drainage sequence with Lenawee soils. Toledo soils have illitic mineralogy, and Hoytville and Ziegenfuss soils are derived from till- these soils occupy landscape positions similar to Lenawee soils."
