  "OVERVIEW": "The Laconner series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in glacial drift with an admixture of volcanic ash over dense glacial till. These soils are on hillslopes of drift plains. Slopes are 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
