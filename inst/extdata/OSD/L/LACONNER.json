They formed in mixed glacial drift with an admixture of volcanic ash over a dense glacial till. Slopes are 0 to 45 percent. These soils have a mild marine climate with cool dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches. Mean January temperature is 36 degrees F., mean July temperature is 64 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is l60 to 210 days."
