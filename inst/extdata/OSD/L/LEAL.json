    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 10 to 24 inches in thickness, and bedrock or any strongly contrasting substratum is at depths of more than 40 inches.  The series control section is typically light loam or sandy loam that contain from 5 to 18 percent clay, from 20 to 50 percent silt, and from 35 to 70 percent sand.  It ranges from 10 to 35 percent by volume of stones, pebbles, or cobblestones.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 7 or 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Typically, the horizon has platy structure parting to fine granular structure, but some pedons have subangular blocky structure.  It ranges from soft to slightly hard and is somewhat brittle in some pedons.  It ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe B2ir horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma ranges from 3 through 6.  The horizon has subangular blocky structure.  It ranges from slightly hard to hard.  It ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid.\nThe C horizon ranges from 5Y through 10YR in hue.  It ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid and acidity generally decreases as depth increases."
