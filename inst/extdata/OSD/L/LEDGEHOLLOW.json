  "OVERVIEW": "The Ledgehollow series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in alluvium over weakly consolidated ash, tuffaceous siltstone or tuffaceous sandstone.  These soils are in concave saddle positions on summits and on shoulders and backslopes of hills.  Permeability is moderately slow. Slopes are 5 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
