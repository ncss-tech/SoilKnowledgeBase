Agustin soils have a decrease in calcium carbonate content with depth.    Filaree and Hayhook soils are noncalcareous to depths of 20 inches or more.  Nasagold receive less precipitation and have a thin Cambic horizon with the lower depth within 20 inches. Pajarito soils contain less than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Pyxo soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Sahuarita soils have buried argillic horizons at depths of 20 to 40 inches."

These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 58 to 70 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 200 to 280 days."
