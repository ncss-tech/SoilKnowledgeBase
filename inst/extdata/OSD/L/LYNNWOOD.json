  "OVERVIEW": "The Lynnwood series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in glacial outwash.  Lynnwood soils are on glacial outwash terraces and have slopes of 0 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 40 to 65 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist or dry.  It has weak fine granular or weak fine subangular blocky structure.  Some pedons have a thin A horizon.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist or dry.  It is loamy and or loamy fine sand.  This horizon has weak fine granular or weak fine subangular blocky structure.  It is strongly acid or medium acid.  The BC horizon has colors intermediate between the Bs and C horizons and is massive or single grained.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  It ranges from loamy fine sand to sand.  This horizon ranges from strongly acid to neutral."

Also, Netarts soils have a mean annual soil temperature of about 54 degrees F.  Greenwater, Indianola, and Pilchuck soils lack a spodic horizon.  Lynden soils are sandy loam in the spodic horizon."

The soils are in a maritime climate of cool, dry summers and mild, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 65 inches.  The average January temperature is 37 degrees F, the average July temperature is 65 degrees F, and mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 180 to 200 days."
