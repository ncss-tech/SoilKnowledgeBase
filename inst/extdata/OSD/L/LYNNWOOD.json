These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist or dry.  It has weak fine granular or weak fine subangular blocky structure.  Some pedons have a thin A horizon.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist or dry.  It is loamy and or loamy fine sand.  This horizon has weak fine granular or weak fine subangular blocky structure.  It is strongly acid or medium acid.  The BC horizon has colors intermediate between the Bs and C horizons and is massive or single grained.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  It ranges from loamy fine sand to sand.  This horizon ranges from strongly acid to neutral."

Covert, Grattan, and Netarts soils are not dry in the moisture control section for as long as 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  Also, Netarts soils have a mean annual soil temperature of about 54 degrees F.  Greenwater, Indianola, and Pilchuck soils lack a spodic horizon.  Lynden soils are sandy loam in the spodic horizon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils are in a maritime climate of cool, dry summers and mild, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 65 inches.  The average January temperature is 37 degrees F, the average July temperature is 65 degrees F, and mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 180 to 200 days."

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an albic horizon from the mineral surface to 1 inches and a spodic horizon from 1 to 15 inches.  Some pedons meet chemical criteria for a spodic horizon and some do not.  All pedons meet micro morphological criteria of cracked coatings and silt-sized and larger pellets.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
