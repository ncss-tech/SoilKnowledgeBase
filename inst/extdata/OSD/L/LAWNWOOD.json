  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the Bh horizon is less than 30 inches from the surface.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the A and E horizons, and from extremely acid to strongly acid in the Bw, Bh, BC&Bh, BC, and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has rubbed color in hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1.  Where the value is less than 3.5, thickness is less than 10 inches.  This horizon is a mixture of organic matter and uncoated sand grains.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma 1 or 2.  Streaks or splotches of darker material range from none to common.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nA Bw horizon may occur between the E and Bh in some pedons.  Where present, it has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma 1 or 2.  It does not meet the requirements for a spodic horizon.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 1 to 3; or it is neutral with value of 2.  It is weakly or moderately cemented in 60 to 90 percent of the horizon.  Many pedons contain noncemented Bh horizons.  Where present, they have the same range of colors and textures as the cemented horizons.  Vertical streaks or pockets of gray, brown, and yellow range from none to common.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nA BC&Bh horizon occurs in some pedons.  Where present, the BC part has the same range of colors as the BC horizon and the Bh part has the same range of colors as the Bh horizon.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nA BC horizon occurs in some pedons.  Where present, it has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 7.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, red, or gray range from none to common.  Discontinuous pockets of loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam range from none to common.  Texture is sand or fine sand."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lawnwood soils are on broad flatwoods in central and southern Florida.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in sandy marine sediments.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches and is heaviest in the summer.  The average annual temperature ranges from 73 to 75 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Ankona, Basinger, EauGallie, Electra, Immokalee, Myakka, Oldsmar, Ona, Placid, Pomello, Pomona, St. Lucie, Wabasso, and Wauchula series.  The very poorly or poorly drained Ankona soils are on similar to lower positions, have spodic horizons 30 to 50 inches below the surface, and have argillic horizons beneath the spodic horizon.  The very poorly or poorly drained Basinger soils are on similar to lower positions, have weakly expressed spodic horizons, and are sandy throughout.  The very poorly or poorly drained EauGallie, Immokalee, Myakka, Oldsmar, Pomona, Wabasso, and Wauchula soils are on similar to lower positions and lack ortstein.  In addition, EauGallie soils have argillic horizons beneath the spodic horizon, Immokalee soils have spodic horizons 30 to 50 inches below the surface, Oldsmar and Wabasso soils have higher base saturation and argillic horizons, and Wauchula soils have argillic horizons.  The somewhat poorly drained Electra soils are on higher positions, have spodic horizons 30 to 50 inches below the surface, do not have ortstein, and have argillic horizons below the spodic horizon.  Ona soils are on similar positions but lack ortstein.  The very poorly drained Placid soils are in sloughs and depressions, have umbric epipedons, and do not have spodic horizons.  The somewhat poorly to moderately well drained Pomello soils are on higher positions, lack ortstein, and have spodic horizons 30 to 50 inches below the surface.  The excessively drained St. Lucie soils are on higher positions, do not have spodic horizons, and are sandy throughout."

During extended dry seasons, the water recedes to depths greater than 40 inches.  Depressions are ponded for periods of 6 to 9 months in most years.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
