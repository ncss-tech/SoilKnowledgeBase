    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid unless limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, or it is neutral, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Eg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Where dominant chroma is 2, there are few to common mottles in shades of yellow, brown, or red.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 or less.  All parts of the Bg horizon within a depth of 30 inches that have dominant chroma of 2, have few to many mottles in shades of yellow, brown, or red.  Mottles may or may not be present if the dominant chroma is 1.  Most pedons have mottles with chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam.\nThe Cg horizon is 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Most pedons are mottled in shades of gray, yellow, or brown.  Texture is loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  In some pedons there are thin strata of silty clay, silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam in the Cg horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Liddell soils are nearly level and are on uplands in the middle and lower Coastal Plain.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.  The soil formed in sediments with fairly uniform amounts of very fine sand and silt throughout.  The sediments are largely of marine origin.  At the type location, mean annual air temperature is 63 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 48 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Exum, Foreston, Goldsboro, Grantham, Lynchburg, Rains, Nahunta, Torhunta, and Woodington soils.  The moderately well drained Exum, Foreston, and Goldsboro soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Lynchburg and Nahunta soils are on slightly higher parts of landscape or nearer to drainageways.  In addition, Exum and Nahunta soils are fine-silty, Foreston soils are coarse-loamy, and Goldsboro and Lynchburg soils are fine-loamy.  Grantham, Rains, and Woodington soils are in similar landscape positions as Liddell soils.  Grantham soils are fine-silty, Rains soils are fine-loamy, and Woodington soils are coarse-loamy.  Torhunta soils are very poorly drained, coarse-loamy and are in slightly lower or depressed positions or are further from drainageways."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Approximately half of the soil area is in forest and the principal species are loblolly pine, black gum, sweetgum, water oak, willow oak, red maple, and occasional pond pine.  Understory plants include sweetbay, inkberry (bitter gallberry), large gallberry, greenbrier, southern bayberry (waxmyrtle), switchcane, giant cane, and other shrubs.  Cleared and drained areas are used for growing corn, cotton, soybeans, wheat, hay, truck crops, and pasture grasses."
