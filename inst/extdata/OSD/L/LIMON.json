  "OVERVIEW": "The Limon series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils\nthat formed in relatively uniform alluvial deposits derived principally from clay and shale.  The Limon soils are on flood plains or alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F.",
