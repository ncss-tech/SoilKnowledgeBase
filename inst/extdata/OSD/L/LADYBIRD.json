  "OVERVIEW": "The Ladybird series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from schist, sandstone, and mudstone. Ladybird soils are on mountains and have slopes of 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2030 millimeters (80 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
