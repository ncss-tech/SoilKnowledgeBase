    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Laryan soils are on upper mountain broad valley drainages and narrow benches of mountain valley backslopes. These soils formed in reworked loess and colluvium or glacial moraine deposits derived from metamorphic rock. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 2,560 to 3,200 meters. The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 550 to 750 mm derived mostly from snow with additional moisture as run-on from adjacent steep slopes and summer thunderstorms. The mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days. Frost may occur during any month at higher elevations."
