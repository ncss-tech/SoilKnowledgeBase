  "OVERVIEW": "Laryan series consist of deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in reworked loess and colluvium or glacial moraine deposits derived from metamorphic rock.  Laryan soils are on upper mountain broad valley drainages and narrow benches of mountain valley backslopes.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 675 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",

The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 550 to 750 mm derived mostly from snow with additional moisture as run-on from adjacent steep slopes and summer thunderstorms. The mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days. Frost may occur during any month at higher elevations."
