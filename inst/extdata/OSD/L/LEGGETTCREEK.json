  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Leggettcreek soils are on strongly convex positions on mountain slopes and ridges that experience limited summer fog. Slopes are 50 to 75 percent. Elevations are 60 to 400 meters. These soils formed in residuum derived from Quaternary- and Tertiary- aged sandstone with thin lenses of gravelly conglomerate. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers with a marine layer influence and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 1780 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C. The frost free period is 240 to 280 days"
