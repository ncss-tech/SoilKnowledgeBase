  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Benin, Dedmount, Stygee, and Torchlight series.\nBenin soils have gypsum crystals and are influenced by loess high in volcanic ash in the upper part.  Dedmount soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convective storms.  Stygee soils have vertic features such as reversible cracks and slickensides and are more moist in summer months.  Torchlight soils are more moist in summer months and have gypsum crystals."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lahontan soils are on lake plains and deltas.  They formed in lacustrine deposits or alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,160 to 1,710 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm. The mean annual temperature is 7 to 13 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 122 and 180 cm (deep free water occurrence class) between March and July when irrigated.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods year-round."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Lahontan soils are used mainly for livestock grazing.  Many areas are irrigated and used for growing tall wheatgrass or a mixture of legumes and grasses.  The dominant native vegetation is black greasewood, inland saltgrass, seepweed, and iodine bush."

  "DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT": {
    "section": "DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT",

The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 27 in Nevada, while other acreage occurs in MLRA 29 in Nevada, MLRA 28A in Utah, and MLRA 11 in Idaho.  Lahontan soils outside MLRA 27 need to be correlated to other series."
