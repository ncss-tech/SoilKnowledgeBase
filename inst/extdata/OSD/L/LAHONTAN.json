  "OVERVIEW": "The Lahontan series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits or alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Lahontan soils are on lake plains and deltas.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",

Dedmount soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convective storms.  Stygee soils have vertic features such as reversible cracks and slickensides and are more moist in summer months.  Torchlight soils are more moist in summer months and have gypsum crystals."
