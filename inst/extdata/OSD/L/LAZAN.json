The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered granitic rocks such as granite or granodiorite.\nReaction: Neutral through slightly alkaline.\nEffervescence: Noneffervescent or slightly effervescent.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 6 to 10 percent.\nRock fragments: 35 to 60 percent, mainly fine (2 to 5 mm) gravel. Lithology of fragments is granitic rocks such as granite or granodiorite.\nA horizons\nValue:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist.\nTexture:  Very gravelly coarse sand or very gravelly loamy coarse sand; some pedons have thin A1 horizons of gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly coarse sandy loam.\nStructure:  Single grain or weak subangular blocky."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lazan soils are on mountains and rock pediments.  They typically occur on all slope positions, but usually have a south-facing aspect.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from granitic rock.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,640 to 2,680 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Nupart and Rockabin soils.  Nupart soils have mollic epipedons and a frigid temperature regime.  Rockabin soils have mollic epipedons and are moderately deep to paralithic contacts."
