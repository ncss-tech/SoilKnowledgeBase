  "OVERVIEW": "The Lewdlac series consists of shallow over a strongly cemented duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium dominantly from quartzite over reworked lacustrine sediments.  The Lewdlac soils are on relict alluvial flats and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.",

These soils formed in mixed alluvium dominantly from quartzite and extrusive igneous rocks over variable substrata including reworked lacustrine sediments.  Elevations are 2,200 to 4,000 feet.  Climate is arid, with cool winters and hot dry summers typical of the Mojave Desert. Average annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches; average annual temperature is 63 to 68 degrees F., and the frost-free season is about 210 to 250 days."
