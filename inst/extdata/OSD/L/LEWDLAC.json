  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Crackerjack (CA) and Jetmine (NV). Crackerjack soils have 8 to 15 percent clay and 25 to 35 percent gravel in the control section. In addition, they have C horizons with 35 to 60 percent rock fragments below the duripan. Jetmine soils have ratios of actual evapotranspiration between summer and winter of about 0.8, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to the Sonoran Desert. In addition, they have duripans that are more than 24 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lewdlac soils are on dissected relict alluvial flats and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium dominantly from quartzite and extrusive igneous rocks over variable substrata including reworked lacustrine sediments.  Elevations are 2,200 to 4,000 feet.  Climate is arid, with cool winters and hot dry summers typical of the Mojave Desert. Average annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches; average annual temperature is 63 to 68 degrees F., and the frost-free season is about 210 to 250 days."
