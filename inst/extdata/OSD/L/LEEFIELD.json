  "STATES": "AL,FL,GA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Leefield series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly to slowly permeable soils on the uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area (MLRA 133A).  They formed in deposits of sandy and loamy sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 90 inches.  Depth to horizons with 5 to 35 percent plinthite ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  The upper 20 inches of the horizon ranges from 15 to 25 percent clay.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid, except where the surface has been limed.  Ironstone nodules, 2 to 15 mm in size, range from 0 to 20 percent, by volume.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 8 and chroma of 2 through 8.  Oxidized iron accumulations in shades of brown and yellow and iron depletions in shades of gray range from none to common.  Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 3 through 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, and gray range from none to common.  Texture is loamy sand or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon, or the Btc horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 through 8, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of red, brown, yellow, and gray range from few to many.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Btv horizon is commonly variegated with masses of iron accumulation in shades of red, brown, or yellow, and iron depletions in shades of gray.  In some pedons, they have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 through 8, and chroma of 3 through 8.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of red, brown, or yellow, and iron depletions in shades of gray range from common to many.  In most pedons, the redder plinthite nodules are oriented horizontally. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Btg or Btvg horizons, where present, have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of red, brown, or yellow range from few to many.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe BC or C horizons, where present, have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8 with masses of iron accumulation in shades of red, brown, or yellow that range from common to many.

Chipley and Lakeland soils are sandy throughout.  In addition Lakeland soils are on higher positions and are excessively drained.  Dothan and Fuquay soils are on higher positions and are well drained. In addition, Dothan soils have surface and subsurface horizons less than 20 inches thick.  Ocilla soils have less than 5 percent plinthite in any horizon.  The moderately well drained Stilson soils are on slightly higher positions."
