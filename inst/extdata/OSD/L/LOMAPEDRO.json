  "REVDATE": "12/2007",
  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  Lomapedro soils are on cuestas, mesas, and structural benches.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
