  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for rangeland or wildlife but cotton and grain sorghum are grown in some areas. The natural plant community is a mixture of salt tolerant grasses and grass-like plants, forbs, and shrubs. Vegetation on most of the site is shrub dominant with saltcedar, Tamarix and Baccharis being the two most prevalent species. Occasionally there will be a few willows and cottonwoods present. In open areas and in the understory there are varying\namounts of alkali sacaton, Texas dropseed, creeping muhly, jointtail, sedge and rushes, inland saltgrass and occasionally some western wheatgrass. Forbs include portulaca sp., kochia, smartweed, dock and annual forbs. In extreme saline areas vegetation is sparse. This soil has been correlated to the Wet Saline (R077CY689TX) ecological site in MLRA-77C."
