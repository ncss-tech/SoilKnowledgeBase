This soil formed in volcanic ash and calcareous tuff with a component of loess.  Average annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches, most of this coming during the winter in the form of snow.  Average annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. Average annual summer temperature is 57 to 64 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 70 to 95 days."

Bluehill soils are mesic and have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Bradshaw, Cedarhill, and Manila soils are not ashy.  Coalbank soils are greater than 40 inches deep to paralithic material and have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Bradshaw, Cedarhill, and Manila soils are in areas of non-ashy parent material. Bluehill soils are on south-facing slopes.  Coalbank soils are in concave positions on north and east-facing slopes."
