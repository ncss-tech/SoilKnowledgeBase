  "OVERVIEW": "The Lonigan series consists of moderately deep over consolidated ash, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and calcareous tuff with a component of loess.  Lonigan soils are on foothills, mountain sideslopes, and toeslopes and have slopes of 5 to 80 percent.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
