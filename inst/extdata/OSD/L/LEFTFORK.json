  "OVERVIEW": "The Leftfork series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from sedimentary rocks.  Leftfork soils are on mountain sideslopes and ridgetops.  Slopes are 5 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
