  "OVERVIEW": "The Las Vegas series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from limestone and lacustrine sediments on basin floor remnants and relict alluvial flats.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches; mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F.",
