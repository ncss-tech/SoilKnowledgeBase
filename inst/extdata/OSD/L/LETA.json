  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the loamy material ranges from 20 to 38 inches. The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches thick. The series control section commonly is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughtout, but some pedons are neutral in the upper 10 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 to 3 with distinct or prominent masses of higher chroma. If value of 3 occurs below 24 inches, it is separated from the mollic epipedon by strata of higher value. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay and averages between 35 and 48 percent clay.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2 with masses of higher chroma. It commonly is stratified silt loam and very fine sandy loam, but pedons with sandy loam strata are not excluded. Some pedons have a sandy substratum below the loamy layers."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Parkville series in the same family.  Similar soils include the Blencoe, Myrick and Onawa series. Parkville soils have clayey textures to depths of less than 20 inches.\nBlencoe soils are not calcareous in the upper part of the particle size control section. Myrick soils have clayey textures to a depth less than 20 inches and are wetter. Onawa soils have a thinner dark colored surface layer."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Leta soils are on nearly level recent flood plains along major streams. The slope gradient is 0 to 2 percent. They formed in 20 to 38 inches of moderately fine and fine textured alluvium deposited over coarser textured alluvial materials. The mean annual temperature ranges from 53 degrees to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 42 inches."

The Haynie, Kenmoor, Modale, Sarpy, and Waubonsie soils have less clay in the solum and are on adjacent landscapes. Myrick soils have clayey textures to depth of less than 20 inches and are in depressions on adjacent landscapes.  Waldron soils are clayey throughout and occur on adjacent landscapes."
