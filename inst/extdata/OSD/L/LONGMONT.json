  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Organic carbon in the surface horizon ranges from .7 to 2 percent and decreases uniformly with increasing depth.  Accumulation of salt more soluble than gypsum is common in the surface horizons but does not exceed 4 percent in any horizon as much as 6 inches thick above a depth of 40 inches.  Exchangeable sodium percentage exceeds 15 percent in 1/2 or more of the upper 20 inches and decreases with increasing depth below 20 inches.  These soils are usually moist due to fluctuating water tables and are saturated in some season of most every year.  Weighted average clay content of the upper 40 inches is 35 to 60 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent but are typically less than 5 percent.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 58 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 72 degrees F.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It has weak subangular blocky or fine granular structure depending on concentration of soluble salts.  This horizon is soft or slightly hard.  It is strongly or very strongly alkaline (pH 8.6 to 9.5) and has more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium in some part.\nThe Ccscag horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR and chroma greater than 2.   It is moderately or strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to 8.8) and becomes less alkaline with increasing depth.  It typically has less than 10 percent exchangeable sodium throughout most of the horizon and the percentage decreases with increasing depth.  This horizon has 4 to 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent and common calcium sulfate crystals."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Longmont soils are on nearly level to slightly concave or depressed areas of flood plains or very gently sloping alluvial fans and terraces.  Slope gradients typically range from 0 to 6 percent.  The soils formed in fine textured calcareous alluvial parent materials derived principally from sedimentary rock.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is about 18 inches, but the soils have a fluctuating water table above a depth of 40 inches most of the year that keeps some part of the control section usually moist, and the soil is saturated at some seasons."
