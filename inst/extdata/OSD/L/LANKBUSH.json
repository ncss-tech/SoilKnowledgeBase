  "OVERVIEW": "The Lankbush series consists of very deep, well drained soils on plains and valleys.  They formed in loamy alluvium from igneous materials over sandy alluvium from granite.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

Bluelight, Eusbio, Sidlake, and Stiles soils are moderately deep to a lithic or paralithic contact.  Hoosegow soils have less than 40 percent sand which is dominantly fine sand in the particle-size control section.  Greenbrae soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lankbush soils are in alluvial fans, fan skirts, old dissected terraces, footslopes, and dissected uplands at elevations of about 2,000 to 5,500 feet.  The slopes range from 0 to 65 percent but are dominantly between 1 and 30 percent.  These soils formed in loamy alluvium from igneous materials over sandy alluvium from granite.  In places, there is some loess influence.  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, including 0.5 to 2 feet of snowfall.  Average annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 160 days."

Lanktree soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Lolalita and Jenness soils lack an argillic horizon.  Payette soils have a mollic epipedon.  Udaho soils occur on sideslopes and breaks, lack argillic horizons, and are moderately deep to consolidated ash.  Lanktree, Lolalita, Jenness and Payette soils are on landscape positions similar to the Lankbush soil."
