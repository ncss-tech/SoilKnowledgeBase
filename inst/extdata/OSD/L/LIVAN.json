  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Livan soils average 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Textures of the fine earth fraction are sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, and fine sandy loam.   The soil moisture control section is usually dry in all parts for at least 60 consecutive days during the 90 day period following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to a seasonal high water table is greater than 6 feet.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is gravelly coarse sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is stratified graelly sandy loam to very gravelly sand, with the fine-earth graction centering on loamy sand or sand.  Total rock fragments average 40 to 75 percent, with 35 to 60 percent gravel and 5 to 15 percent cobbles. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
