  "OVERVIEW": "The Leiter series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum or alluvium over residuum derived primarily from shale.  Leiter soils are on fan remnants, plateaus, hills, and broad ridges.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
