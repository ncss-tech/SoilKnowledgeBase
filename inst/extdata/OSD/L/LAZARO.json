    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lazaro soils are on beveled summits and shoulders of hills. They formed in alluvium derived locally from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum of Precambrian granite bedrock. Slopes are 5 to 45 percent. Elevation ranges from 7,300 to 9,000 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 18 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."
