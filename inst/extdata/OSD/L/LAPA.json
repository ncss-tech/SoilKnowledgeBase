These soils are on steep `a`a lava flows that have been scalped of the original overlying clinkers and replaced with a thin layer of glacial till and ash. Underlying lava flows are 14,000 to 250,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 20 to 50 percent. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 400 to 600 millimeters (16 to 24 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1,520 to 1,780 millimeters (60 to 70 inches). The mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 14 degrees C. (45 to 57 degrees F.) The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)"
