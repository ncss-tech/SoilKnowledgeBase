    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:   The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick and the depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Calcium carbonate averages 40 to 60 percent in the control section.\nMean annual soil temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 64 degrees F. The soil is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 or more consecutive days within the 4 months following the summer solstice, and is moist for 45 or more consecutive days within the 4 months following the winter solstice in 6 out of 10 years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is silt loam, gravelly silt loam, gravelly loam, very gravelly loam, or very gravelly silt loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 60 percent, with 0 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles. It is neutral to moderately alkaline and slightly calcareous or moderately calcareous.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist. It is gravelly silt loam, gravelly loam very gravelly loam or very gravelly silt loam. Rock fragments range from 20 to 55 percent, with 20 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent as cobbles. This horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist. It is extremely gravelly loam, very gravelly loam or very gravelly silt loam. Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent, with 30 to 55 percent as gravel and 0 to 20 percent as cobbles. The Bk horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  In Idaho, rock fragments in the upper part of the Bk horizon range from 20 to 40 percent and include gravelly textures.  The particle size control section averages more than 35 percent rock fragments."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 10 inches (A horizon).\nCalcic horizon - the zone from 16 inches to the bedrock.\nParticle size control section - the zone from 10 inches to bedrock.\nCarbonatic mineralogy - the particle size control section averages more than 40 percent by weight carbonates in the size fraction less than 20 mm in diameter.\nField work is needed on the Lonjon series to determine if pedogenic lime is present in the Bk as filaments, soft coatings, or soft nodules.  The portion of the mollic range of 7 to 10 inches would not be an applicable part of the concept if the lime is not present as filaments, soft coatings, or soft nodules.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
