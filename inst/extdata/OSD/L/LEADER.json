  "OVERVIEW": "The Leader series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in mixed volcanic ash over glaciofluvial deposits. The Leader soils are on outwash terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.",
