Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. Redox concentrations and depletions are observable in this layer due to the long duration of ponding.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline and most pedons are calcareous.\nThe C1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is stratified silty clay, clay, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.  Redox concentrations and depletions are observable in this layer.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline and is calcareous.\nThe C2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is stratified loamy fine sand, fine sand, or sand.  Reaction is moderately alkaline and is calcareous.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Texture is stratified loamy fine sand, fine sand, or sand.  Reaction is moderately alkaline and is calcareous."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lebron soils are on nearly level flood plains of major drains and their tributaries of the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA-80A).  They formed in clayey alluvial sediments which have been deposited over stratified sandy alluvial sediments in depressional areas.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean Annual Precipitation: 26 to 40 inches. Mean Annual Temperature: 58 to 64 degrees F. Thornthwaite Annual P-E indices: 44 to 64. Frost free days: 200 to 230. Elevation: 700 to 1300 feet."
