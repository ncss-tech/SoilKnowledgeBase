  "OVERVIEW": "The Lebron series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils on flood plains.  These nearly level to slightly concave soils formed in clayey alluvial sediments over sandy alluvial sediments.  These soils are on depressional areas of major drainageways and some of their tributaries throughout the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA-80A). These soils are ponded for long duration throughout the year.  Depth to a water table ranges from 20 inches to 40 inches from October through June.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 61 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 33 inches.",
