  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 70 inches, and depth to carbonates is below 50 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The solum ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is typically fine sandy loam but ranges to include loam, sandy loam, and loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Typically it is loam containing sufficient increase in clay content to qualify for an argillic horizon.\nThe remaining Bt horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is typically silty clay loam or clay loam averaging between 27 to 35 percent clay. Thin, shiny dark coatings are common on fresh exposed surfaces of peds throughout these horizons.  Reddish brown mottles below a depth of 30 inches are common.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, or loam.  Reaction is generally neutral.  Below a depth of 55 inches the texture ranges from fine sandy loam to sand in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Lancaster, Loretto, and Wells series in the same family and the Houdek, Moody, Paka, and Ree series. Lancaster soils are moderately deep over sandstone or sandy shale. Loretto soils typically have less clay in the Bt horizon and have carbonates higher in the profile.  Wells soils formed in residuum weathered from reddish sandstone and sandy shale.  Houdek soils formed in glacial material and have carbonates higher in the profile.  Moody and Paka soils are fine-silty, and in addition, Paka soils formed in residuum weathered from calcareous siltstone.  Ree soils formed in loamy alluvium and have a thinner solum."

The Leisy soils formed in eolian sand and the underlying loess.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 49 to 51 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 28 inches."
