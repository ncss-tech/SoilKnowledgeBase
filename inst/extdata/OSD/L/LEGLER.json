  "OVERVIEW": "The Legler series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from sedimentary tuffaceous rocks.  Legler soils are on incised flood plains, terraces and fans and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Soils are moist in winter and spring.  They are warmer than 41 degrees F from April 1 to November 1, and they are dry within this period after July 1.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The solum is 40 to 60 inches thick.  Depth to secondary carbonates is typically 10 to 40 inches but may range to 50 inches in some pedons. The particle-size control section is 18 to 35 percent clay, more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand, and 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silt loam, or loam with 0 to 25 percent gravel and 15 to 30 percent clay.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw and Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 8 dry and 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  The hue is inherited from the parent material.  It is silty clay loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam or loam in the upper part and ranges to sandy loam and sandy clay loam in the lower part.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw  or C horizon, when present, is at depth of 40 to over 60 inches.  Hue is 7.5YR to 2.5Y.  It is loam, silty clay loam or sandy clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay and 0 to 30 percent gravel."

The soils formed in alluvium from reddish, greenish, and brownish hue parent material weathered from the John Day Formation.  The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 15 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F, mean January temperature is 29 to 31 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is 63 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 150 days."
