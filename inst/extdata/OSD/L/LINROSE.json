  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Linrose soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions with north and east-facing aspects.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from shale, argillite, chert, and quartzite.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,680 to 2,445 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 350 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 60 to 100 days."
