  "OVERVIEW": "The Linrose series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from shale, chert, and quartzite.  Linrose soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
