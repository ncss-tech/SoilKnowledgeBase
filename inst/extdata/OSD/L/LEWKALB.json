  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the firm brittle layer is 10 to 26 inches and the thickness ranges from 12 to 42 inches.  Gravel content throughout the profile is to 15 percent.  Pebbles range from 2mm to 20mm in diameter.  Mean annual soil temperature is 66 degrees to 68 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 8 and 25 inches is dry all the time from April 1 to December 1 and is moist in some part for less than 90 consecutive days.  Organic matter content is less than 0.5 percent.  The particle-size class control section averages 6 to 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 6/2, or 6/3 and moist color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, or 5/4.  It is sandy loam or loam.  Structure ranges from weak platy in the surface to weak subangular blocky below the surface or are structureless.  EC is  greater than 2.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 2.5Y 7/2, 7/3, 10YR 6/4, 7/3, or 7/4 and moist color of 2.5Y 6/2, 6/3, 10YR 5/4, or 6/4.  The firm brittle layer crushes to a sandy loam, loam, or loamy sand.  Peds do not slake in 1N HCL.  This firm layer is weakly cemented with silica.  Some pedons lack thin clay films that coat sand grains.  Textures below the firm layer are sandy loam or loam.  The C horizon is nonsaline to moderately saline and is sometimes alkali.  The SAR is 0 to 30.  Some areas of this soil are underlain by a buried sandy loam or loam B horizon."
