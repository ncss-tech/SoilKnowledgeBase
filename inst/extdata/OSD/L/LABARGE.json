  "OVERVIEW": "The Labarge series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed alluvium derived from interbedded sedimentary rock. These soils are on floodplains and floodplain steps. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 205 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.",
