  "OVERVIEW": "The Leton series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent, but is dominantly less than 0.5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 20.5 degrees C (degrees 69 F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1397 mm (55 in).",
