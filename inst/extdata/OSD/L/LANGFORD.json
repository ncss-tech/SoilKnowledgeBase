Texture is similar to the Bw horizon. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe Bx horizons have hues of 7.5YR through 5Y, values of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is very coarse prismatic that commonly parts to subangular blocky, or the horizon is massive. Consistence is firm or very firm and the material is slightly brittle. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline and is neutral within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).\nSome pedons have a transitional BC or CB horizon with color and texture similar to the Bx or C horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. It is massive or has plate like divisions. Consistence is firm or very firm. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline. Some pedons have a 2C horizon that is high in silt content and low in rock fragment content."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Marilla series is the only series in the same family. Marilla soils do not have a neutral reaction within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).\nThe Bath, Broadalbin, Cambridge, Canaseraga, Ira, Lackawanna, Mardin, Montauk, and Wurtsboro series are similar soils in related families. Bath, Broadalbin, Ira, Lackawanna, Mardin, Montauk, and Wurtsboro soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section. Cambridge soils have an argillic horizon in the fragipan. Canaseraga soils have a coarse-silty particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Langford soils are on convex, linear, and concave summits, shoulders, and backslopes of hills in glaciated uplands. Some areas are drumloidial hills. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. These soils formed in till derived from siltstone, sandstone, shale, and some limestone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 795 to 1,725 mm (31 to 68 inches), mean annual temperature ranges from 6.0 to 11.0 degrees C (43 to 52 degrees F), and mean annual growing season ranges from 105 to 180 days. Generally, these soils occur at elevations between 100 and 670 meters (328 and 2,198 feet) but have been mapped as high as 750 meters (2,460 feet) in some areas."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chenango, Chautauqua, Chippewa, Erie, Howard, Lordstown, Mardin, Schuyler, and Valois soils. Chenango and Howard soils, and more poorly drained associates, are on nearby glaciofluvial terraces and outwash plains. Chautauqua soils have less clay and lack a fragipan. Somewhat poorly drained Erie soils are in a drainage sequence with Langford soils. Lordstown soils occupy higher bedrock controlled landscapes. Mardin soils are in nearby geographic areas and have a lower clay content and more acid reaction in the subsoil. Schuyler soils lack a fragipan. Valois soils are formed in glaciofluvial material and lack a fragipan."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: A \"blue sheet\" dated 1969 showed the type location in Wyoming Co. NY classified as fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Fragiochrepts. The REMARKS section on the blue sheet mentioned that the series was formerly classified as a Sols Bruns Acides with a fragipan. By 1974, the same Wyoming Co. typical pedon was reinterpreted with reference to the original fragipan observation of \"clay in pores\" and was reclassified as Fragiudalfs (oriented clay and thus an argillic in the pan.) In a 1986 revision of the Langford OSD, the type location is described in Chautauqua Co. NY and had been reclassified as fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Fragiochrepts. At present, the Langford OSD type location remains in Chautauqua Co. with its most modern classification of fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Fragiudepts. The previous REMARKS section mentioned that it was moved to Chautauqua Co. because lab data indicated there was insufficient illuviated clay to qualify as an argillic horizon. Following completion of MLRA evaluation projects, it was determined that the type location will remain in Chautauqua Co. Although on the fringe of MLRAs 139 and 140, it is within the mesic temperature regime and fits the central concept of the Langford series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches (Ap horizon).\nb. Cambic horizon - the zone from 23 to 53 cm (9 to 21 inches) (Bw horizon).\nc. Fragipan - the zone from 53 to 114 cm (21 to 45 inches) (Bx horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for the Langford series is available from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory in Lincoln, NE, and the soil survey laboratories at Cornell University and Pennsylvania State University.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
