  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:   Volume of gravel in the control section averages between 15 and 35 percent but subhorizons in some pedons have less than 15 percent or more than 35 percent. Gravel is mostly of igneous origin and commonly 0.2 to 5 cm in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is loamy sand. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, sand, or their gravelly analogues.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is coarse sand, sand, or their gravelly analogues. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is gravelly coarse sand or gravelly sand but some subhorizons are sand, coarse sand, or the very gravelly or extremely gravelly analogs.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral."

The Crex, Mooers, Pelkie, Sissabagama, Sunia, Tourtillotte, Westoo and Wurtsmith soils average less than 15 percent rock fragments by volume in the particle size control section. The Seulchoix soils have carbonates in the lower part of the series control section."

These soils formed in sandy glacial outwash of Late Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 26 to 33 inches. Frost-free days range from 90 to 135. Elevation above sea level ranges from 600 to 1600 feet."
