Gravel is mostly of igneous origin and commonly 0.2 to 5 cm in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is loamy sand. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, sand, or their gravelly analogues.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is coarse sand, sand, or their gravelly analogues. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is gravelly coarse sand or gravelly sand but some subhorizons are sand, coarse sand, or the very gravelly or extremely gravelly analogs.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral."
