  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lacarreta series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in gypsiferous lacustrine deposits. These nearly level soils are on playas. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 67 degrees F.",
