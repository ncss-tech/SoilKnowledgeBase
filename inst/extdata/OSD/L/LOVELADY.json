    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 60 to 80 inches. The weighted average clay content of the control section ranges from 20 to 35 percent. The combined thickenss of the A and E horizons ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rounded quartzite pebbles and smooth fragments of petrified wood, typically less than 3 inches across the long axis, range from few to about 5 percent in the A, E, and Bt/E horizons of most pedons. These fragments also form a discontinuous stone line at the contact of the 2Bt horizon. Depth to the lithologic discontinuity ranges from about 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand. Clay content ranges from 2 to 8 percent and silt content ranges from 7 to 21 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid unless limed.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4. Iron accumulations in shades of brown, red or yellow range from none to common. Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bt/E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Iron accumulations in shades of red, brown, or yellow range from few to many. Some pedons have iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less in the lower part. Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam. The E part consists of a albic materials and makes up 5 to 30 percent of the horizon, however some subhorizon 4 inches or more thick is presentg that contains 15 or more percent albic material. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe 2Bt or 2Bt/E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Iron accumulations in shades of red, brown, or yellow range from few to many. Some pedons have a variegated matrix of these colors. The upper part of this horizon typically has about 2 to 10 percent albic materials. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe 2CB or 2C horizon, where present has matrix colors in shades of gray or brown. Iron accumulations or strata in shades of brown, yellow or red range from few to many. It is mainly sandstone may also be stratified layers of mudstone and shale. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy clay. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. The Kurth, Larton, Larue, Penning, and Wolfpen series are in closely related families. Kurth and Penning soils do not have a sandy epipedon more than 20 inches thick. Larton, Larue and Wolfpen soils do not have a glossic horizon, and have siliceous mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lovelady soils are on very gently sloping to moderately sloping uplands. They formed in sandy and loamy sediments of early Pleistocene age mainly over the Yegua Formation of Tertiary Age, but also over the Whitsett Formation in some areas. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 46 inches. Mean annual temperature is 65 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit. The frost free days range from 230 to 240. Elevation ranges from 300 to 420 feet above sea level. The Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 70 to 76."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the closely related Kurth and Penning soils, and Fuller and Keltys soils. Fuller and Pennings soils are on lower and wetter positions on the landscape. They have aquic conditions and matrix chroma of 2 or less in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Keltys and Kurth soils are on similar positions as Lovelady soils. Keltys soils have a coarse-loamy control section. Kurth soils do not have a sandy epipedon more than 20 inches thick."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Lovelady soils are well drained. Permeability is moderate. Runoff is very low on slopes of 1 to 5 percent; and low on slopes of 5 to 8 percent. The soil has a saturated layer that is present for very brief to brief periods below a depth of 2 to about 4 feet and above the discontinuity in the winter and springs seasons for a cumulative duration of two to four weeks during normal years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soil are used for woodland or pasture. Native vegetation is mainly loblolly and short leaf pine with hardwood species that include red oak, sweetgum, elm, hickory, and blackjack oak. Understory vegetation consists mainly of American beautyberry, hawthorn, yaupon, persimmon, greenbriar, and sassafras, with lesser amounts of bluestems, yellow Indiangrass, purpletop triden, longleaf uniola, purple lovegrass, and tick clover. Indicator plants or plants that are adapted to sandy soils include yucca and bullnettle. Well managed pastures are commonly producing improved bermudagrass, pensacola bahiagrass, or weeping lovegrass."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Lovelady soils were formerly included with the Kurth series as a loamy fine sand phase. The name Lovelady is from a nearby community in Houston County. The surface texture of this soil according to laboratory data is borderline between loamy fine sand and fine sandy loam. However, the field texture method and some native indicator plants indicate a sandy texture.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the type location pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 26 inches (A and E horizons).\nAlbic horizon - 11 to 26 inches (E horizon).\nGlossic horizon - 42 to 50 inches (Bt/E2).\nArgillic horizon - 26 to 76 inches (Bt/E, 2Bt/E, and 2Bt).\nADDITIONAL DATA: TAMU Laboratory Sample No. S84TX-225-01.  Minerology data were run by TAMU on two pedons from Trinity County on the Whitsett Formation (S97TX-455-001 and S97TX-455-002).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
