Rounded quartzite pebbles and smooth fragments of petrified wood, typically less than 3 inches across the long axis, range from few to about 5 percent in the A, E, and Bt/E horizons of most pedons. These fragments also form a discontinuous stone line at the contact of the 2Bt horizon. Depth to the lithologic discontinuity ranges from about 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand. Clay content ranges from 2 to 8 percent and silt content ranges from 7 to 21 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid unless limed.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4. Iron accumulations in shades of brown, red or yellow range from none to common. Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bt/E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Iron accumulations in shades of red, brown, or yellow range from few to many. Some pedons have iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less in the lower part. Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam. The E part consists of a albic materials and makes up 5 to 30 percent of the horizon, however some subhorizon 4 inches or more thick is presentg that contains 15 or more percent albic material. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe 2Bt or 2Bt/E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.

The upper part of this horizon typically has about 2 to 10 percent albic materials. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe 2CB or 2C horizon, where present has matrix colors in shades of gray or brown. Iron accumulations or strata in shades of brown, yellow or red range from few to many. It is mainly sandstone may also be stratified layers of mudstone and shale. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy clay. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid."

Native vegetation is mainly loblolly and short leaf pine with hardwood species that include red oak, sweetgum, elm, hickory, and blackjack oak. Understory vegetation consists mainly of American beautyberry, hawthorn, yaupon, persimmon, greenbriar, and sassafras, with lesser amounts of bluestems, yellow Indiangrass, purpletop triden, longleaf uniola, purple lovegrass, and tick clover. Indicator plants or plants that are adapted to sandy soils include yucca and bullnettle. Well managed pastures are commonly producing improved bermudagrass, pensacola bahiagrass, or weeping lovegrass."

The surface texture of this soil according to laboratory data is borderline between loamy fine sand and fine sandy loam. However, the field texture method and some native indicator plants indicate a sandy texture.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the type location pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 26 inches (A and E horizons).\nAlbic horizon - 11 to 26 inches (E horizon).\nGlossic horizon - 42 to 50 inches (Bt/E2).\nArgillic horizon - 26 to 76 inches (Bt/E, 2Bt/E, and 2Bt)."
