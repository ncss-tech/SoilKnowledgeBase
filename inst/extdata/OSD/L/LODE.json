  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Unless otherwise stated depth ranges in this paragraph are measured from the mineral surface. The loamy mantle ranges from 16 to 36 inches thick.  Depth to the underlying sandy material is 20 to 40 inches.  The thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 48 inches.  Gravel content ranges from 1 to 20 percent in the loamy mantle and from 4 to 40 percent in the sandy material. Cobble content ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout.  In some places a thin cobble and gravel lag line occurs at the loamy and gravel interface.  The loamy mantle ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.  The sand and gravel substratum ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe O horizons consist mostly of hardwood, conifer and herbaceous litter, contain many fine to very fine roots, have medium to high amounts of charcoal, some white or yellow mycelia and are extremely acid or very strongly acid.  Some pedons have Oa horizons, 1 inch thick with hue of 10YR or 5YR, value of 2 and chroma of 1 or 2 and have weak or moderately fine or medium granular structures.\nThe Ap horizon (plantation furrows) has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Undisturbed pedons have A horizons with hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value is 2 or 3; and chroma is 1 or 2.  Where present, the E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A and E horizons are silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam.\nThe Bs1 and Bs2 horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.  They are fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam or the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bs3 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR and value and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs of these textures.\nThe 2C horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma 3 to 6.  It is sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly, very gravelly analogs.  Stratification is common."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lode soils occur on glacial drainageways, stream terraces and deltas, and outwash plains.  They formed in 16 to 36 inches of modified loamy eolian deposits and in the underlying sand and gravel.   The slope gradient commonly is 1 to 3 percent, but the range is 1 to 35 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 43 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 33 inches."

Present timber species consists of aspen, balsam fir, white spruce, red maple, jack pine, red pine, and eastern white pine.  Small acreages also support sugar maple, yellow birch, American basswood, and hemlock."

The loamy eolian upper material has been modified through windthrow action and postglacial erosion.\nLaboratory data is not available for this series.
