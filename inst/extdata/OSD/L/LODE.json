  "REVDATE": "12/2006",
  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lode series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in modified loamy eolian deposits and in the underlying sand and gravel and are on glacial drainageways, stream terraces, deltas, and outwash plains.   Slopes are commonly 1 to 3 percent but range up to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Unless otherwise stated depth ranges in this paragraph are measured from the mineral surface. The loamy mantle ranges from 16 to 36 inches thick.  Depth to the underlying sandy material is 20 to 40 inches.  The thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 48 inches.  Gravel content ranges from 1 to 20 percent in the loamy mantle and from 4 to 40 percent in the sandy material. Cobble content ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout.  In some places a thin cobble and gravel lag line occurs at the loamy and gravel interface.  The loamy mantle ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.  The sand and gravel substratum ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe O horizons consist mostly of hardwood, conifer and herbaceous litter, contain many fine to very fine roots, have medium to high amounts of charcoal, some white or yellow mycelia and are extremely acid or very strongly acid.  Some pedons have Oa horizons, 1 inch thick with hue of 10YR or 5YR, value of 2 and chroma of 1 or 2 and have weak or moderately fine or medium granular structures.\nThe Ap horizon (plantation furrows) has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Undisturbed pedons have A horizons with hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value is 2 or 3; and chroma is 1 or 2.  Where present, the E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A and E horizons are silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam.\nThe Bs1 and Bs2 horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.  They are fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam or the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bs3 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR and value and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs of these textures.\nThe 2C horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma 3 to 6.  It is sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly, very gravelly analogs.  Stratification is common."

The mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 43 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 33 inches."

The loamy eolian upper material has been modified through windthrow action and postglacial erosion.\nLaboratory data is not available for this series.
