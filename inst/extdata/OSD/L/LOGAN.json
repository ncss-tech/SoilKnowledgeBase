  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.\nThe particle-size control section ranges from 25 to 35 percent clay with textures of silt loam or silty clay loam.  The Logan soils are generally free from salts and alkali, but are moderately affected in some areas.  Depth to a seasonal high water table is from the soil surface to 20 inches. The calcium carbonate equivalent averages from 15 to 40 percent in the particle-size control section.  Electrical conductivity of the saturation extract is 0 to 4 throughout.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon and depth to calcic horizon is 10 to 25 inches. Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Oe horizon where present is peaty in places and ranges to 12 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Clay content is 18 to 35 percent.  Organic matter content is most commonly 6 to 10 percent but ranges from 4 to 20 percent.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 3 to 25 percent.\nThe Bkg horizon has hues of 2.5Y, 5Y, 5GY or neutral, value of 5 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist and chroma of 1 or less.  Structure is lacking to weak subangular blocky or is weak to moderate prismatic parting to angular blocky.  It is weakly cemented in places.  The consistence is friable or firm moist and slightly hard or hard dry.  The calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 60 percent.  Textures are silt loam and silty clay loam.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have organic stains on faces of peds and lining pores.  Carbonates are in nodules, soft masses or are disseminated.\nThe Cg horizon has hues of 2.5Y, 5Y or neutral, value of 5 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist and chroma of less than 2 where the soil is not mottled.  The lower C horizon consists of stratified coarse to fine textured mixed lacustrine sediments and alluvium.  Textures are silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay and fine sandy loam.  Structure is massive or prismatic parting to angular blocky.  Consistence is hard to extremely hard dry and firm to very firm moist.  Some pedons have carbonates as fine filaments."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chipman(UT), Harpster(IL), Prophetstown(IL) and Provo Bay(UT) series.  The Chipman soils have a dominant hue of 10YR above 30 inches.  Harpster soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 53 to 57 degrees F. and receive more than 32 inches of precipitation.  Prophetstown soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the control section and receive more than 32 inches of precipitation.  The Provo Bay soils have more than 40 percent carbonates in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Logan soils are on smooth to undulating stream terraces, lake terraces, and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  These soils have formed in moderately fine textured alluvium and reworked lake sediments from many kinds of rocks, but dominantly from quartzite, sandstone, limestone and gneiss.  The climate is dry subhumid or dry semi-arid in Nevada.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 18 inches.  Elevation ranges from 4,200 to 6,100 feet.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F, the average summer temperature is 65 to 73 degrees F, and the freeze-free period is 90 to 180 days."

Airport soils have horizons of clay accumulation that are high in exchangeable sodium.  Bramwell and Kirkham soils are somewhat poorly drained and Bramwell lacks a mollic epipedon.  Cudahy soils have a petrocalcic horizon.  Ironton soils have a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches thick and are in a coarse loamy family.  Roshe Springs soils have more than 40 percent carbonates in the particle-size control section.  Woods Cross soils are noncalcareous throughout."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone of dark colored soil material from the surface of the mineral soil to a depth of 15 inches.  (A horizon)\nCalcic horizon - the zone of calcium carbonate accumulation from a depth of 15 inches to a depth of 28 inches.  (Bkg horizon)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches.\nThe classification is based on the \"Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eighth Edition, 1998\".  Superactive cation exchange activity class is based on NSSL data.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
