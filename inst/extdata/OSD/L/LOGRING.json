  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Logring series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone, dolomite and other highly calcareous sedimentary rocks. Logring soils are on mountains and hills. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
