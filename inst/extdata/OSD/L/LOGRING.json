These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from limestone, dolomite and other highly calcareous rocks. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. Elevations are 1,526 to 2,770 meters. The average annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, the average annual air temperature is 7 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free season is about 80 to 130 days."
