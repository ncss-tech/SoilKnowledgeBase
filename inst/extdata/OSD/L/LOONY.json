These soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The upper 14 to 20 inches of the 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  Depth to densic material is 20 to 40 inches.  The content of rock fragments throughout the particle-size control section averages 5 to 25 percent.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid in the surface layer and subsoil to neutral in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moint.  It is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.\nThe 2CB horizon has5 to 15 percent cobbles and 10 to 25 percent pebbles.\nThe 2Cd horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam with lenses of loamy sand or sand, and may be gravelly or cobbly.  It is 5 to 25 percent pebbles and 2 to 5 percent cobbles.  Moist bulk density is 1.70 to 2.00 with an RV of 1.85 g/cc."

Eloika soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days and have many distinct redox features in the 2C horizon.   Tillicum soils are fine sandy loam and sandy loam in the Bw horizon and have 10 to 40 percent weathered schist or gneiss rock fragments in the lower part of the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Loony soils are on till plains and toeslopes of mountains.  These soils formed in volcanic ash over dense or compacted glacial till.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent on primarily west, north and east facing aspects.  Elevations range from 2,500 to 4,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 18 to 27 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 22 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
