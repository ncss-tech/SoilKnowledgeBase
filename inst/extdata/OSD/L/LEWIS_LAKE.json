  "OVERVIEW": "The Lewis Lake series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in clayey and silty lacustrine sediments over outwash on glacial outwash plains and lake plains. These soils have moderately slow and slow permeability in the upper part and rapid and very rapid in the lower part. Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
