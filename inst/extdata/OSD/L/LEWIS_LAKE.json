It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the upper mantel and moderately acid to neutral in the underlying sands and gravels.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam, silty clay loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam. Uncultivated pedons can have an O horizon 1 to 2 inches thick.\nWhen present, the E horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe B/E or E/B horizon has colors and textures similar to the E and Bt horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 5Y, or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silty clay, clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam. Redoximorphic depletions are in the lower part.\nSome pedons can have a BC or Bk horizon.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of hue 7.5YR or 5YR, value 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loamy fine sand to coarse sand or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues.  Clay bridging is few to common.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of hue 7.5YR or 5YR, value 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.

They formed in clayey and silty lacustrine sediments over outwash. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 33 inches. Frost free days range from 90 to 145. Elevation above sea level ranges from 670 to 1450 feet."

The zone of saturation is between 2.0 feet and 3.5 feet at some time from April and May in years of normal precipitation.  Steeper slopes have shorter duration saturation."
