Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the upper 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid throughout unless limed.  Some pedons have buried A horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Dry value is 6 or 7.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  The Ap horizon has weak or moderate, very fine or fine granular structure or it is massive.  It is very friable or friable.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  The C horizon below 40 inches in some pedons ranges from silt loam to fine sandy loam.  Some pedons are stratified in the lower part.  The C horizon is dominantly massive.  Consistence is very friable or friable."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lille soils are on flood plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in alluvial deposits of very fine sand and silt.  Flooding frequency ranges from once or twice a year to once in 5 to 10 years or more.  Flooding generally occurs during spring runoff or during periods of high rainfall in the fall.  Floodwater seldom covers these soils for more than 1 or 2 days on the higher positions, but the duration may be slightly longer in the lower positions.  The climate is humid and cool temperate.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 40 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 120 days.  Elevation ranges from 360 to 600 feet above mean sea level."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: 1.  This revision reflects a change in classification from coarse-silty, mixed, acid, frigid Typic Udifluvents to coarse-silty, mixed, acid, superactive, frigid Typic Udifluvents to conform with Keys to Soil Taxonomy, seventh edition, 1996  2.  The Lille series will replace soils formerly mapped Hadley in Northern, Maine.  3.  Temperature studies are needed to confirm the classification of frigid versus cryic.  4.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 16 inches (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons).\nb.  Fluvents feature - The content of organic carbon decreases irregularly with depth or remains above a level of 0.2 percent to a depth of 50 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Source of data used in establishing the taxonomic class and range in characteristics is Maine Agricultural Experiment Station, Technical Bulletin 137, February 1990.\nThe Soil Interpretation Record number for the Lille series is ME0135.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
