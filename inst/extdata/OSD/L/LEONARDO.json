  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 38 degrees to 42 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 43 degrees to 47 degrees F. The upper part of the control section contains more than 30 percent pyroclastic glass in the sand and coarse silt materials. These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice. Content of coarse fragments in the upper portion of the particle-size control section ranges from 5 to 35 percent. Content of coarse fragments in the lower portion of the control section exceeds 50 percent. The mollic epipedon has a base saturation of 55 to 70 percent, and is more than 20 inches thick. The solum is 25 to 40 inches thick. The soils are moderately to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist. It is ashy fine sandy loam or ashy loam and is gravelly in some pedons. This horizon has weak to moderate granular structure.\nThe AC horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry. It is ashy loam or ashy fine sandy loam and is gravelly or stony.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 dry. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam and is very gravelly, extremely stony, very gravelly or very stony."

Buckhouse soils are strongly to very strongly acid. Growden soils have umbric epipedons. Maude soils are massive in all parts, contain pumice within the control section and have umbric epipedons."

They formed in volcanic ash, loess, and material from siliceous rocks. These soils occur in a cold subhumid climate; mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.; and frost-free season is about 80 to 100 days."
