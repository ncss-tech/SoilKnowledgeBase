The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for more than 90 but less than 150 cumulative days in normal years. July through August and November through March are the driest months. Intermittently moist from September through October and April through June. These soils receive runoff from surrounding uplands and the soil moisture control section is moist for longer periods of time than is normal for the climate of the series province.\nMean annual soil temperature: 17 to 19 degrees C (63 to 66 degrees F)\nDepth to secondary calcium carbonate: 15 to 61 cm (6 to 24 in)\nDepth to slickensides: 15 to 36 cm (6 to 14 in)\nSolum thickness: more than 203 cm (80 in)\nParticle-size control section: 40 to 55 percent silicate clay.\nThis is a cyclic soil and undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microhighs 15 to 51 cm (6 to 20 in) higher than microlows. Distance between the center of the microhigh and the center of the microlow is about 1 to 7 m (5 to 12 ft). The microhigh makes up about 25 percent, the intermediate, or area between the high and low, about 50 percent, and the microlow about 25 percent. Cracks open and close each year except during higher than normal rainfall years, and remain open for less than 150 cumulative days during most years. When dry, 1 to 3 inch wide cracks extend from the surface to a depth of 102 cm (40 inches) or more. Cracks are more prominent in the microlows. COLE is more than 0.07.

Common vegetation includes buffalograss, vine mesquite, western wheatgrass, white tridens, and fall aster. Sedges and frog-fruit grow in some of the microdepressions. Stunted lotebush and mesquite grow on some of the microhighs. A few areas are cultivated to wheat, cotton, and sorghums.
