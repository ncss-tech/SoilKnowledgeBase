  "OVERVIEW": "The Lerch series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in clayey till and/or clayey lacustrine deposits modified by wave action over loamy and/or sandy stratified lacustrine deposits.  They are on till plains and/or lake plains.  Permeability is very slow in the clayey till and moderate to rapid in the stratified substratum.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Water table studies in this soil and associated soils were used to classify this series.\nOnly series status, responsibility, and scrivener's errors changed - 4/09."
