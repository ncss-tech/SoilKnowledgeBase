  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the clayey till or lacustrine material ranges from 40 to 60 inches over the stratified substratum.  Reaction in the upper part of the solum ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid, and in the lower part of the solum and substratum is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 11 to 23 inches.  The weighted average clay content at 10 to 40 inches ranges from 60 to 85 percent.  Total rock fragment content is less than 3 percent throughout the profile.  Redox features, saturation and aquic conditions occur within 10 inches of the surface at some time in most years.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR or 10YR or is neutral; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 2.  Some pedons have a thin layer of hemic material at the surface.\nSome pedons have an A horizon up to 4 inches thick.  It has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y or is neutral; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 or 1.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  Some pedons have an Ap horizon up to 7 inches thick with colors similar to the A horizon.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay, or the mucky analogs of these textures.\nSome pedons have an Eg horizon up to 8 inches thick.  It has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay or clay.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon up to 8 inches thick.  It has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silty clay or clay.\nThe Btg horizon has colors and textures similar to the Bg horizon.  It has few to common clay films but does not have a significant increase in clay content.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  It has few to common clay films but does not have a significant increase in clay content.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  It has few to common clay films but does not have a significant increase in clay content.  It contains visible free carbonates.\nThe Bk horizon has colors and textures similar to the Btk horizon.  It has evidence of stratification or layered depositional origin in the lower part.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 4 to 8.  This layer is stratified.  Textures in this layer include fine sand, very fine sand, loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, and silt loam.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Lerch soils are on nearly level areas and in depressions on lake plains and till plains.  These soils formed in clayey till and/or clayey lacustrine deposits modified by wave action over stratified loamy and/or sandy lacustrine deposits.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 36 to 40 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Anton, Borea, and Bergland series.  The moderately well drained Anton and somewhat poorly drained Borea soils are in a drainage catena with Lerch soils.  The poorly drained Bergland soils are on similar landscape positions where deeper clay deposits are present."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained and very poorly drained.  Runoff is very low or ponded.  Permeability is very slow in the clayey deposits and moderate to rapid in the stratified substratum.  Lerch soils have a perched seasonal water table above the clayey till that ranges from 1 foot above the surface to 1 foot below the surface at some time during the period from September to June in normal years. This soil also has an apparent water table below 40 inches in the stratified substratum at some time during the same time period in normal years."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include: Sapric soil materials - 0 to 3 inches (Oa horizon);\nCambic horizon - 3 to 56 inches (Bg, Btg, Bt, Btk, Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons);\nalthough there is translocated clay in this series - there is not enough to be an Argillic horizon.\nEpisaturation; Lerch soils react positively to the alpha, alpha-dipyridyl test: aquic moisture conditions.\nThe reddish colors inherent in the parent material mask the redoxomorphic features (color - chroma) and make taxonomic classification difficult.  Water table studies in this soil and associated soils were used to classify this series.\nOnly series status, responsibility, and scrivener's errors changed - 4/09.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
