  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are moist in the winter and spring and dry in the summer and fall for 45 to 60 consecutive days.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 56 to 59 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock and thickness of solum is 20 to 40 inches.  The linear extensibility of the solum is 2.0 to 4.0 centimeters.  Rock fragments in the particle-size control section range from 15 to 35 percent and are dominantly gravel.  The mollic epipedon is 16 to 34 inches thick and typically includes most of the 2Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is clay loam with 27 to 40 percent clay.  It has 2 to 4 percent organic matter.  There is an absolute clay increase of 10 to 20 percent between the A and 2Bt.  The lower boundary is abrupt or clear.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It is clay with 40 to 60 percent clay.  It contains 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.  It has 0.5 to 2.0 percent organic matter."

All of these soils except for Luna, Mancos, Mayflower, and Runlett soils are over 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Luna soils have an O horizon and have a 10 inch thick paralithic contact above the bedrock.  Mancos and Runlett soils have a udic soil moisture regime.  Mayflower soils have a paralithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Leemorris soils are on mountains and tablelands at elevations of 6,000 to 7,200 feet.  Slopes are 3 to 35 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum over basalt and andesite.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."

Duff soils are on mountainsides, mountain footslopes, pediments, and glacial valleys.  They have an argillic horizon and are greater than 40 inches deep.  Noname soils are on ridges and shoulder mountain side slopes.  Noname soils are shallow to bedrock and have an ochric epipedon."
