  "OVERVIEW": "The Leemorris series consist of moderately deep, well drained soils on mountains and tablelands.  They formed in residuum and colluvium over basalt and andesite.  Slopes are 3 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are moist in the winter and spring and dry in the summer and fall for 45 to 60 consecutive days.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 56 to 59 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock and thickness of solum is 20 to 40 inches.  The linear extensibility of the solum is 2.0 to 4.0 centimeters.  Rock fragments in the particle-size control section range from 15 to 35 percent and are dominantly gravel.  The mollic epipedon is 16 to 34 inches thick and typically includes most of the 2Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is clay loam with 27 to 40 percent clay.  It has 2 to 4 percent organic matter.  There is an absolute clay increase of 10 to 20 percent between the A and 2Bt.  The lower boundary is abrupt or clear.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It is clay with 40 to 60 percent clay.  It contains 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.  It has 0.5 to 2.0 percent organic matter."

All of these soils except for Luna, Mancos, Mayflower, and Runlett soils are over 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Luna soils have an O horizon and have a 10 inch thick paralithic contact above the bedrock.  Mancos and Runlett soils have a udic soil moisture regime.  Mayflower soils have a paralithic contact."
