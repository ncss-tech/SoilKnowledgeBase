  "OVERVIEW": "The Littlesage series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from calcareous shale bedrock. These soils are on hillslopes. Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 5.0 degrees C.",
