  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is more than 40 inches.  Cobbles and stones range from 20 to 35 percent throughout the profile.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 40 degrees F. and the mean annual summer soil temperature is about 54 degrees F. Base saturation is less than 60 percent in some part above a depth of 30 inches. The soils are usually moist and are not dry for as much as 90 cumulative days in some subhorizon. A thin layer of needles and tuff occur in places mainly under the tree canopy.\nThe Al horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. The moist value of 2 or 3 extends to depths of 2 inches or less.\nThe B2 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 through 5. It is cobbly sandy loam or cobbly coarse sandy loam. Clay films are thin and patchy, occurring mostly in pores and are more evident deep in the profile."

Cuberant and Scout soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section and have base saturation of more than 60 percent. Cuberant soils are 20 to 40 inches deep over bedrock. Leal soils have B2ir horizons, and A2 horizons. Marsell soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section."

Slopes are 15 to 40 percent.  Elevation ranges from 8,000 to 10,000 feet above sea level. The climate is humid, with an average annual precipitation of 25 to 35 inches that falls mostly as snow. The mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F., mean summer temperature is about 54 degrees F. and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. Lake Janee Series"
