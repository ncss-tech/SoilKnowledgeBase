  "OVERVIEW": "The Lake Janee series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from intermediate igneous rocks. Lake Janee soils are on ground and lateral moraines, and have slopes of 15 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

The mean annual soil temperature is about 40 degrees F. and the mean annual summer soil temperature is about 54 degrees F. Base saturation is less than 60 percent in some part above a depth of 30 inches. The soils are usually moist and are not dry for as much as 90 cumulative days in some subhorizon. A thin layer of needles and tuff occur in places mainly under the tree canopy.\nThe Al horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. The moist value of 2 or 3 extends to depths of 2 inches or less.\nThe B2 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 through 5. It is cobbly sandy loam or cobbly coarse sandy loam. Clay films are thin and patchy, occurring mostly in pores and are more evident deep in the profile."
