  "OVERVIEW": "The Livingston series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous estuarine and glaciolacustrine clays on glacial lake plains. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low to moderately high in the mineral surface layer and subsoil, and very low to moderately low in the substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 36 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

Guffin soils are less than 40 inches to bedrock.\nSimilar soils in related families are the Biddeford, Canandaigua, Covington, Latty, Lyons, Madalin, Maybid, Panton, Paulding, Scantic, and Scitico soils. Biddeford, Latty, Madalin, Maybid, Scantic and Scitico soils have a fine particle-size control section, and Biddeford and Scantic soils have a frigid soil temperature regime. Canandaigua soils have a fine-silty particle-size control section. Covington and Panton soils have argillic horizons. Lyons soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section. Paulding soils have Ochric epipedons."
