  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum ranges from 30 to 48 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the A and Bg horizons, is neutral or slightly alkaline in the BCg horizon, and ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline in the Cg horizon. Flooded and depressional phases of the Livingston series are recognized.\nThe A horizon is neutral or has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 or 1. Texture is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, or their mucky analogs. Structure is moderate or strong, very fine to coarse granular or very fine subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable or friable. It is sticky and plastic.\nThe Bg and BCg horizon are neutral or have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 0 through 2. Texture is clay. Structure is weak to strong, medium to very coarse prismatic or weak to strong, very fine to medium subangular or angular blocky, or weak or moderate, medium or thick platy. Consistence is firm or very firm. It is sticky or very sticky, plastic or very plastic.\nThe Cg horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. Some strata may range to chroma of 4 in the BCg and Cg horizons. Texture is clay. Structure is moderate or strong, fine or medium, angular or subangular blocky, or is massive with varves. Consistence is firm or very firm It is sticky or very sticky, plastic or very plastic."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Guffin is the only series in the same family. Guffin soils are less than 40 inches to bedrock.\nSimilar soils in related families are the Biddeford, Canandaigua, Covington, Latty, Lyons, Madalin, Maybid, Panton, Paulding, Scantic, and Scitico soils. Biddeford, Latty, Madalin, Maybid, Scantic and Scitico soils have a fine particle-size control section, and Biddeford and Scantic soils have a frigid soil temperature regime. Canandaigua soils have a fine-silty particle-size control section. Covington and Panton soils have argillic horizons. Lyons soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section. Paulding soils have Ochric epipedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Livingston soils are nearly level soils on glacial lake plains. They are in depressions and drainageways. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in calcareous estuarine and glaciolacustrine clays. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 36 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees Fahrenheit. The frost-free season ranges from 130 to 165 days. Elevations range from 50 to 1000 feet above mean sea level."

Elmridge, Elmwood, Melrose, Swanton, and Whately soils are on outwash landforms and have coarse-textured material over fine-textured material. Histosols are in depressions and are organic soils."
