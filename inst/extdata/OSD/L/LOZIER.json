    "content": "REMARKS: Series concept revised and taxonomic subgroup changed from Lithic Haplocalcids to Lithic Ustic Haplocalcids in 2007, better reflecting the soil climate in the Pecos River area of the Western Edwards Plateau. Typical pedon moved from Terrell County to Upton County to reflect soil climate regime more representative of the revised series concept.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 10 cm (0 to 4 inches). (A horizon)\nCalcic horizon: 10 to 30 cm (4 to 12 inches). (Bk layer)\nLithic contact: the upper boundary of limestone bedrock at (30 cm) 12 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA: National Soil Survey Laboratory Data are available for one pedon from Val Verde County, Texas, S77TX-465-4, (78P2106-2106).\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
