  "STATES": "NM,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lozier series consists of very shallow or shallow, well drained, moderate permeable soils over very slowly permeable bedrock. The soils formed in loamy residuum and colluvium derived from limestone bedrock. These nearly level to very steep soils have slopes ranging from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm (15 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).",

Typical pedon moved from Terrell County to Upton County to reflect soil climate regime more representative of the revised series concept.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 10 cm (0 to 4 inches). (A horizon)\nCalcic horizon: 10 to 30 cm (4 to 12 inches). (Bk layer)\nLithic contact: the upper boundary of limestone bedrock at (30 cm) 12 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA: National Soil Survey Laboratory Data are available for one pedon from Val Verde County, Texas, S77TX-465-4, (78P2106-2106).\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
