  "OVERVIEW": "The Lydiann series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian deposits of Pleistocene age. These nearly very gently sloping to gently sloping soils occur on strandplain. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 840 mm (33 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (71 degrees F).",
