Nisene soils are dry for more than 90 consecutive days in summer and have average annual soil temperatures of 56 to 58 degrees F.  Roseburg soils have average annual soil temperatures of 52 to 56 degrees F. and lack buried Bt horizons.  Yaxing soils are dry for 75 to 90 days in summer and are mildly alkaline."

These soils formed in material weathered from granitic residuum overlain by a thick mantle of loess at elevations of 2,700 to 3,400 feet.  Average annual temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 22 to 25 inches.  The frost-free period is from 110 to 130 days."
