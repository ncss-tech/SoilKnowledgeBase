  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lauby series consists of deep, and very deep well drained soils on loess mantled granitic hills.  They formed in material weathered from granitic residuum overlain by a thick mantle of loess. Permeability is moderately slow.  Slope ranges from 15 to 35 percent.  Average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",
