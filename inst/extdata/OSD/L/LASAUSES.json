  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The LaSauses soils are calcareous and strongly or very strongly alkaline in their uppermost horizon, but are slightly to strongly acid in the lower part of the control section.  At least some subhorizon between depths of 10 and 20 inches is noncalcareous.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 15 to 45 percent in the surface horizons and decreases as depth increases.  Calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, and other soluble salts are concentrated in the upper part of the control section but decrease as depth increases.  Calcium sulfate may depress pH readings in some pedons.  The soil is base saturated in the upper part of the control section but ranges from 60 to 100 percent base saturated in the lower part.  The control section is usually heavy clay loam or clay and has 35 to 60 percent clay, 5 to 45 percent silt, and 10 to 60 percent sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in a major part of the control section and usually less than 3 inches in diameter.  A major part of the control section above a depth of 60 inches has hue of 7.5YR or yellower.  Mottling of redder hue occurs in most pedons but does not predominate.  Chroma of 2 or less comprises less than 60 percent of the soil mass between depths of 6 and 30 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 45 degrees F; and the mean summer soil temperature is 62 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 3 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It ranges from moderately to very strongly alkaline.\nThe B2g horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It ranges from mildly alkaline to strongly acid and becomes more acid as depth increases."

Longmont soils are calcareous and moderately alkaline in the lower part of the control section and have montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Mishak soils have medium to moderately fine textured control sections with less than 35 percent clay, and are calcareous in the lower part of the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The LaSauses soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping flood plains and alluvial fans.  The soils formed in alluvial parent materials.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 7 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer."
