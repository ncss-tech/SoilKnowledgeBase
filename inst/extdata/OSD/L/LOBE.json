Potential competitors that are not classified according to the current Keys are Cometcrik (MT), Eagleton (MT), Lakepark (MN), and Marshbrook (SD).  The Cometcrik, Kovich, and Mannixlee soils have discontinuities and 2C horizons.  Eagleton soils have redox concentrations at the surface.  Lakepark soils have free carbonates at a depth of 25 to 50 inches.  Marshbrook and Nythar soils have Bg horizons.  Welch soils have 27 to 35 percent clay."
