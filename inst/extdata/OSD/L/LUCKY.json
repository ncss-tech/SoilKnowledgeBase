  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 15 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The soils are 60 to 100 percent base saturated.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent and are mainly pebbles and cobbles.  In some pedons subhorizons redder than 7.5YR are present but the major part of the solum or any C horizon above the bedrock has hue of 7.5YR or yellower.  These soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section for some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, with chroma of 1 through 3.  It is medium acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, with chroma of 1 through 6.  It is usually sandy clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 35 percent silt, and 40 to 70 percent sand with more than 35 percent being fine sand or coarser.  This horizon is medium acid to mildly alkaline and remains constant or becomes slightly more alkaline with increasing depth.  In some pedons a C and thin Cr horizons occur above 40 inches."

Amsden, Croydon, Gebson, Gelkie, Hourglass, Kittredge, Leavitt, Lyonman, Michelson, Monad, Monida, Morset, Oro Fino, Philipsburg, Swede, Tingey, Wellsville, and Youga soils lack a lithic contact at depths less than 40 inches.  Buffork, Cific, Inchau, Lymanson, Tripit, and Troutdale soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Cific, Dra, Passcreek, Rammel, and Woosley soils are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon and have continuous subhorizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation.  Miracle soils have hue of 5YR or redder in a major part of the control section.  Mult, Newlands, and Primeaux soils have less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the argillic horizon.  Kezar soils have a large proportion of coarse and very coarse angular sand and have extremely hard consistence when air-dry.  (T)Slacks soils are usually moist in the soil moisture control section when the temperature is greater than 41 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lucky soils are on mountain side slopes and ridges.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  The soil formed in moderately fine to moderately coarse parent materials weathered from gneiss, shist, or hard tuff.  Elevation ranges from 7,500 to 9,000 feet.  In more northern latitudes, elevation ranges down to 6,000 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 20 inches, ranging from 18 to 25 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F, and mean summer temperature is 55 degrees F.  The frost-free season is less than 70 days."
