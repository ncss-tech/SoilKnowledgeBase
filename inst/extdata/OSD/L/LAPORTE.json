  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The average annual soil temperature is 49F.  and the average summer soil temperature is 67F.  The soils are dry more than .6 of the time that the soil temperature exceeds 5C.  The mollic epipedon is 5 to 15 inches thick and the depth to the underlying bedrock\nis 10 to 20 inches.  The mollic epipedon contains from .6 to 2 percent organic carbon which decreases uniformly with increasing depth.  These soils are calcareous at or within a few inches of the surface.  The control section is typically channery loam but ranges in clay from 15 to\n35 percent, in silt from 20 to 55 percent, and sand from 15 to 60 percent, with more than 15 percent but less than 35 percent being fine sand or coarser.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent by volume and\nare dominantly less than 6 inches in length.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3\nmoist, and chroma of 1.5 to 3.  Typically, it has granular or crumb structure but has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  It is\nsoft or slightly hard and is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent of the strongest part of\nthe Ck horizon is about 16 percent but ranges from 10 to 35 percent.  A considerable proportion of the calcium carbonate equivalent results from\nfine limestone pebbles and sand-sized fragments which results in equivalent readings of the whole soil (3/4 inch and smaller) of 40 to 50\npercent."

The soils formed in material\nthat weathered from or is strongly influenced by the underlying limestone\nbedrock.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 15 to\n18 inches, most of which falls during the spring and early summer.  The frost-free season is about 135 to 150 days.  In central New Mexico, the mean annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  The frost free period is 110 to 135 days.  Elevations are 6,800 to 7,500 feet."
