  "OVERVIEW": "The Laporte series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum weathered from limestone. Laporte soils are on upland hills, cuestas and ridges. Slopes of 2 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 405 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

A considerable proportion of the calcium carbonate equivalent is derived from fine limestone gravel and sand-sized fragments, resulting in equivalent readings of the whole soil (2 cm and smaller) of 40 to 50 percent.\nReaction: pH 7.9 to 9.0"
