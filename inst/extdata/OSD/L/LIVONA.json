The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness.  The underlying glacial till contains 2 to 8 percent coarse fragments.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2.  It typically is fine sandy loam, but the range includes sandy loam, loam, or loamy fine sand.  It is neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It is neutral.\nThe Bt and 2Bt horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam.  They are neutral or mildly alkaline.  Some pedons have a Btk horizon.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.

It has a calcium carbonate equivalent of about 4 to 15 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It commonly is loam or clay loam glacial till, but in some pedons, soft sedimentary rock is below depths of 40 inches.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nCOMPETING SERIES  These are the Bookcliff, Bullflat, Dooley, Empedrado, Fairfield, Farnuf, Felor, Greenway, Gurney, Hangdo, Krem, Lefor, Lininger, Martinsdale, Moen, Reeder, Sponseller, Trag, Ulrant, Vida, Watrous, Wemple, Williams and Yegen series in the same family and the Max soils. Bookcliff, Bullflat, Gurney, Hangdo and Ulrant soils do not have glacial till within depths of 10 to 20 inches.  Dooley soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to glacial till and have more sand in the lower part of the sola.  Empedrado soils formed in materials weathered from rhyolite, andesite and trachyte.  Fairfield and Martinsdale soils have calcic horizons with more than 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  In addition, Fairfield soils contain carbonates within depths of 10 inches.  Farnuf soils formed in alluvium and commonly are stratified.  Felor soils have clayey sediments with 35 to 50 percent clay between 20 and 35 inches deep.  Greenway soils have more clay in the lower part of the solum.  Krem soils have a sandy epipedon 20 to 40 inches thick over glacial till.  Lefor and Yegen soils have more sand in the Bt horizons.  In addition, Lefor soils have soft sedimentary beds at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Lininger soils have metamorphic bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Moen, Reeder, and Watrous soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Sponseller soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Trag soils do not have accumulations of secondary carbonates.  Vida soils have the base of the argillic above a depth of 10 inches.  Wemple soils are more acid in the upper part of the solum and are formed in material containing volcanic ash.  Williams soils have less than 10 inches of moderately coarse textured A horizon.  Max soils do not have argillic horizons."
