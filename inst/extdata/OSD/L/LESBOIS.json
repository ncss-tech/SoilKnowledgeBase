  "OVERVIEW": "The LesBois series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils with high saturated hydraulic conductivity that formed in alluvium from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent in valleys. The average annual precipitation is about 292 mm and the average annual temperature is about 10.6 degrees C.",
