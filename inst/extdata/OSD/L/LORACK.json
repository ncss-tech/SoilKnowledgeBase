  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 45 to 70 inches thick.  Base saturation in the lower B2t or B3t horizons is between 2 and 33 percent.   The soil between the depths of 11 and 28 inches is usually dry in all parts all the time from late July until late September or early October and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  Mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 46 degrees F.  The soil is influenced but not dominated by amorphous material.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4; 5YR 4/4, 5/6 and 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4; 5YR 3/4, 4/6 moist.  It is gravelly, very gravelly fine sandy loam, very gravelly loam or gravelly loam and has 15 to 45 percent pebbles.  It is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe B2t horizon is 7.5YR 5/6, 6/6, 6/8; 10YR 5/8, 6/6 and 7.5YR 4/6, 5/6, 5/8, 6/6; 5YR 5/6, 5/8 moist. It is gravelly or very gravelly heavy loam, light clay loam, clay loam or silty clay loam, and has 15 to 50 percent pebbles and 5 to 25 percent cobbles, averaging about 45 percent rock fragments.  The B2t horizon is very strongly to moderately acid.  Some pedons have a C horizon of very gravelly sandy loam texture between the B2t horizon and the compacted glacial till.  The glacial till is intermittently cemented with either silica or iron."

Euer and Inville soils have solum less than 40 inches thick.  Jorge soils have base saturation of 50 to 75 percent in the B2t horizon.  Rasser soils have silt loam A horizons and have a lithological discontinuity below the A horizon. (See Remarks for Pincushion series)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Loracks soils are on gently sloping to steep terraces or moraines at elevations of 5,500 to 7,000 feet.  They formed in glacial outwash and till from mixed sources.  The climate is typified by warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 65 to 75 inches, most of which occurs as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 44 to 50 degrees F., mean January temperature is 35 degrees F., and mean July temperature is 65 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is 100 to 125 days."

Data Review and Soil Correlation by Sherrell, Cook, Huntington and Hartman, Pincushion soils are not skeletal and do not have sufficient clay increase for an argillic.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in February of 2003.
