  "OVERVIEW": "The Lastchance series consists of moderately deep to a petrocalcic, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone and dolomite. Lastchance soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
