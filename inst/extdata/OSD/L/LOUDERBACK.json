    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Louderback soils are on lake plains, beach plains, and lake terraces. They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Elevations range from 1,030 to 1,520 meters. The climate is cool-arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 110 to 160 days."
