  "OVERVIEW": "The Louderback series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Louderback soils are on lake plains, beach plains, and lake terraces. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
