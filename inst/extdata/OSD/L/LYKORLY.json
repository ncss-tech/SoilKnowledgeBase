  "OVERVIEW": "The Lykorly series consists of very deep, well drained soils on fan remnants and stream terraces. These soils formed in mixed alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rocks. Slope is 1 to 6 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches (406 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F (12 degrees C).",
