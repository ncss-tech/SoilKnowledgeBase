Arnor, Dermala, and Iwela soils have greater than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Augustine, Flugle, Parkelei, and Pinitos, soils contain more than 35 percent sand. Arnor, Augustine, and Navajita soils formed in parent material derived from acid igneous rocks. Carri, Celacy, Celavar, Evpark, Nyjack and Ribera soils are moderately deep. Iwela soils have more than 5 percent rock fragments in the control section. Bosonoak soils have hue redder than 7.5YR. Dermala soils have more than 5 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section and have a frost-free period of less than 130 days. Navajita soils formed from the Bandelier Tuff formation and have a significant content of volcanic glass and pararock fragments. Orlie soils have less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. Arwite, Bigbow, Dalhart, Deekay, Elwop, Fort Collins, Gateson, Oldwolf, Olnest, Rauzi, Rockybutte, Stoneham, Toluca, and Wagonhound soils receive most of the annual precipitation in the spring and fall and are in LRR-E or LRR-G."
