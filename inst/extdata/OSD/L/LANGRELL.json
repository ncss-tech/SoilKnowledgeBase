  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are usually moist but are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days within the four month period following the summer solstice in most years. The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F. The thickness of the solum is 20 to 50 inches. The thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches. The 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section has 8 to 18 percent clay and averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments. In some pedons, there are lime coatings on the underside of rock fragments at depths of 30 inches or more.\nThe A horizon and the Bw horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam with 10 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam, loamy sand or loam with 20 to 50 percent gravel, 0 to 40 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones. Total rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam or loamy sand with 20 to 60 percent gravel, 15 to 40 percent cobbles, and 0 to 15 percent stones. Total rock fragments range from 50 to 85 percent."

Dehlinger soils are dry for 90 to 120 consecutive days and have 18 to 30 percent clay in the pscs. Demox soils are dry for more than 90 consecutive days and have 35 to 60 percent angular shaped rock fragments of colluvial origin.  Drit soils are dry for more than 80 consecutive days and have 40 to 75 percent angular shaped rock fragments of granitic colluvial origin. Gamboa soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 58 degrees F, are dry for more than 80 consecutive days, and are 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact (sandstone). Murken soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact (basalt), dry for more than 80 consecutive days, and have 18 to 25 percent clay in the pscs.  Packard soils have 25 t0 35 percent clay in the pscs.  Plumas soils are dry for more than 80 consecutive days. Raster soils do not have cambic horizons.
