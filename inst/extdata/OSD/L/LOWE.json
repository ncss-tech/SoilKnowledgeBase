  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 36 inches in thickness and extends into the Bk horizon of most pedons. The 10 to 40 inch control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent fine sand and coarser sand. The soil typically is calcareous throughout, but some pedons do not have carbonate to a depth of 10 inches. The calcic horizon has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 15 to 45 percent. Electrical conductivity of the saturation extract is typically less than 4 mmhos/cm but a saline phases are recognized where the conductivity is up to 16 mmhos/cm.\nThe Ap horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry; and chroma of 1 or less.  It typically is loam, but in some pedons is clay loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk and Bkg horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y or are neutral; value of 2 to 5 and 3 to 7 dry; and chroma of 0 to 2.  If mottles are not present, chroma is 1 or less moist, below the mollic epipedon.  It typically is loam or clay loam, but in some pedons it is silt loam.  Carbonates are disseminated in most pedons, but some have few to many accumulations of carbonate.  Few to common gypsum crystals are in some pedons.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Some pedons have a Bkb horizon.\nThe Akb horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry.  It is sandy loam, loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons do not have an Ab horizon.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is stratified loam, clay loam, or sandy loam, but strata of silty clay loam, sandy clay loam or loamy sand are in some pedons.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have gravelly material below a depth of 40 inches.  Some pedons have few or common gypsum crystals in the Cg horizon.  Some pedons are not stratified in the Cg horizon."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Easby, Hapur, Nortonville, and Vallers series.  Easby soils have an EC greater than 16 mmhos/cm.  The Hapur soils have a drier soil moisture control section and have a shorter growing season.  Nortonville soils have a gypsic horizon.  Vallers soils do not have a uniform sand size distribution in the series control section and have more coarse fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Mean annual temperature ranges from 43 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 24 inches.  Growing season is about 125 to 130 days; average growing season precipitation from 15 to 18 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 2900."

Divide and Marysland soils have sand and gravel at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. They are in positions on the landscape similar to the Lowe series.  Fulda, Lamoure, and La Prairie soils do not have a calcic horizon within a depth of 16 inches.  In addition, Fulda soils have a fine textured series control section and are in slight depressions and drainageways.  Lamoure soils typically are adjacent to the stream channel.  The moderately well drained La Prairie soils are in slightly higher landscape positions."
