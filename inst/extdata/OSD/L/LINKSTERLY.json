The mean annual soil temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.   Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to glacial till is 40 to over 60 inches.  The particle-size control section contains 50 to 80 percent volcanic glass and glass-coated aggregates.  Field estimated clay content is 5 to 15 percent.\nThe Oi horizon is 1 to 4 inches thick, except where disturbed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR and value of 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 2 to 5 percent gravel.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and 2 to 4 dry.  It contains 2 to 5 percent gravel.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 dry and chroma of 4 moist and 4 or 6 dry.  It is very cobbly ashy sandy loam or very cobbly ashy loam.  It contains 15 to 25 percent gravel, 15 to 25 percent cobbles and 5 to 15 percent stones.  It contains a total of 35 to 50 percent rock fragments.  Field estimated clay content is 10 to 18 percent."

The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 70 inches, falling mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 35 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 10 to 50 days."

Bott soils are on mountains and have a buried argillic horizon at 20 to 30 inches. Douthit soils are on glacial moraines and are ashy-skeletal.  Haynap soils are on glacial moraines and have a cindery surface mantle. Minkwell soils are on glacial moraines, have an argillic horizon at 20 to 40 inches and are ashy over medial."
