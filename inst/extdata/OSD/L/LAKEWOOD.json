Soil reaction ranges from extremely acid to very strongly acid throughout the profile, unless limed. Depth to seasonal high water table is greater than 60 inches.\nThe Oi horizon is slightly decomposed plant material, mostly leaves, needles, and twigs.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 1 or 2. The texture is sand or loamy sand. Ap horizon (if present) has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 1 or 2. The texture is sand or loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 4 to 8.

Evesboro soils do not have thin Bh horizons, on similar landforms. Klej soils are somewhat poorly drained and a seasonal high water table at 12 to 24 inches, on lower-lying positions. Lakehurst soils are moderately well drained and have a seasonal high water table at 18 to 42 inches. on lower-lying positions. Pittsgrove soils are well drained, have an argillic and weakly expressed fragipan horizon, on similar landforms. Woodmansie soils are well drained and have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section, on adjacent ridges"
