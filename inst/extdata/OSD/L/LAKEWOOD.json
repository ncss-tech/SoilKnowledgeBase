  "OVERVIEW": "Lakewood series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils on marine terraces. They are formed in sandy marine sediments. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 56 degrees F near the type location and mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches.",

Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent, by volume in the A, E, and B horizons and 0 to 30 percent in the C horizon and are mostly gravel. Soil reaction ranges from extremely acid to very strongly acid throughout the profile, unless limed. Depth to seasonal high water table is greater than 60 inches.\nThe Oi horizon is slightly decomposed plant material, mostly leaves, needles, and twigs.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 1 or 2. The texture is sand or loamy sand. Ap horizon (if present) has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 1 or 2. The texture is sand or loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 4 to 8. The texture is sand or loamy sand.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 3 to 8. The texture is sand or loamy sand.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 3 to 8.

Atsion and Berryland soils are poorly drained spodosols, on lower-lying positions. Downer soils are well drained, have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section, on similar landforms. Evesboro soils do not have thin Bh horizons, on similar landforms. Klej soils are somewhat poorly drained and a seasonal high water table at 12 to 24 inches, on lower-lying positions. Lakehurst soils are moderately well drained and have a seasonal high water table at 18 to 42 inches on lower-lying positions. Pittsgrove soils are well drained, have an argillic and weakly expressed fragipan horizon, on similar landforms. Woodmansie soils are well drained and have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section, on adjacent ridges."
