  "OVERVIEW": "The Leanto series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian deposits.  These soils are on structural benches and cuestas with slopes of 2 to 6 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
