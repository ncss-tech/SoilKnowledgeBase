  "OVERVIEW": "The Laveta series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in sandy slope alluvium over residuum weathered from sandstone.  Laveta soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
