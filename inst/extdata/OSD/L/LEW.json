  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 80 inches or more.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 5 to 50 percent in the A horizon and from 35 to 70 percent or more in the B horizon and in the C horizon, where present.  Rock fragments consist of pebbles, channers, flags, and stones that are commonly greenstone.  The soil is very strongly acid through moderately acid throughout, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Where value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 2, the A horizon is less than 6 inches thick.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BA or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 8.  A lithologic discontinuity is evident in the lower part of the Bt horizon of most pedons.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is sandy loam, loam, or silt loam."

Bendavis, Blackthorn, Elliber, Gainesboro, Irondale, Macove, Mertz, Trevlac, and Weverton soils do not have greenstone fragments.  Croom soils have very firm, sticky, very gravelly sandy clay loam Bt horizons.  Hartleton and Pattenburg soils have sola less than 40 inches thick; in addition Pattenburg soils have Bt horizons with hue of 2.5YR or redder."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lew soils are primarily on moderately steep to very steep sideslopes, but also on gently sloping to steep colluvial and alluvial foot slopes and fans, in the Blue Ridge Mountains.  Slopes range from 2 to 75 percent, commonly being between 15 to 25 percent.  These soils are generally stony, very stony, or extremely stony.  Lew soils formed mainly in colluvium weathered from greenstone.  It formed in local alluvial material in some areas.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 59 degrees F.  Precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches.  Elevations range from 1800 to 3000 feet above sea level."

Braddock and Myersville soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the textural control section.  Cardiff and Porters soils have thinner sola. Cataska soils have a cambic horizon.  Catoctin soils have a discontinuous argillic horizon and are less than 40 inches to bedrock.  Laidig soils have a fragipan."

The pH determinations are shown as reaction for each horizon in typifying pedon -- data from V.P.I. Laboratory, profile 176.  Base saturation is 4.79 percent and pH 5.5 in lower part of 2Bt3 horizon (V.P.I. and State University Soil Survey Laboratory sample 72-053, February, 1972).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
