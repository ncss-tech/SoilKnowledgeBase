  "OVERVIEW": "The Lininger series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed material weathered from schist, gneiss, and granitic rocks.  Lininger soils are on mountain slopes, foot slopes, ridges and have slopes of 1 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
