  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Sandstone gravel is 0 to 10 percent throughout. The particle size control section averages 28 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 40 percent sand coarser than very fine. Concretions and iron depletions are below 36 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is silt loam or loam.\nSome pedons lack E or BE horizons.\nThe BE and Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. The redder hues are commonly in the lower subhorizons. They are typically clay loam or loam, but the Bt1 is silty clay loam in some pedons and individual horizons may be sandy loam. Sandstone cobbles range from 0 to 5 percent. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to medium acid in the upper part and is very strongly or extremely acid in the lower part.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Redox colors of gray or brown are common. Texture is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or loam with evidence of rock structure. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lamotte soils are on convex sideslopes and point ridges. Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent. They formed in a thin layer of loess and in the underlying residuum weathered from sandstone. The bedrock includes lenses or alternating beds of dolomite in some areas. The mean annual temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 40 to 45 inches."
