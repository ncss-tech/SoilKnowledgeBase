  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 40 inches thick and depth to calcareous material ranges from 0 to 6 inches.  Organic carbon in the mollic epipedon ranges from .8 to 2 percent and decreases uniformly as depth increases.  Cation exchange capacity ranges from approximately 70 to 100 milliequivalents per 100 grams of clay.  The particle size control section is typically heavy silty clay loam or light silty clay and has 35 to 50 percent clay, 20 to 50 percent silt, and 10 to 40 percent sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent and are typically less than 1 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Normally the horizon has fine granular structure but has weak subangular blocky structure where plowed.  It is soft to slightly hard.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has moderate to weak prismatic or blocky structure.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline and has 2 to 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Usually there are a few crystals of calcium sulfate scattered throughout this horizon.  These soils have few distinct mottles below depth of 40 inches in some pedons."

The average annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches, with peak precipitation occurring during the spring and summer.  The mean annual temperature is 47 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature is 68 degrees F."
