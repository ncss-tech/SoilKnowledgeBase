  "OVERVIEW": "The Lobat series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium from igneous and metamorphic rocks.  Lobat soils are on mountain footslopes.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 4.4 degrees C., and mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm.",
