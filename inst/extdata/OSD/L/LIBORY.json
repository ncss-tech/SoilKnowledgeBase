Sandhill substratums may be mostly fine-loamy and loamy and stream terrace substratums may be mostly fine-silty and silty.\n8/2007 RRH: Introductory Paragraph: revised landform/landscape and parent materials; Typical Pedon: Changed A2 horizon to AB horizon. Range in Characteristics: A: deleted fine sand, AB: added, 2Bw2: revised reaction based on data in Holt, Brown, and Arthur Counties, 2C2: changed textures to same as 2Bw2 and added sandy loam, revised reaction; Geographic Setting: revised; Geographically Associated Soils: revised to agree with type location - deleted Boelus, Dunday, Kenesaw,  Loretto, Lute, Nora, Ortello, Ovina, and Thruman soils, added Loup and Valentine soils; Drainage and Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity through Remarks: revised.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data for pedon ID 83NE017031 is available from the National Soil Survey Center, Soil Survey Laboratory. Pedon 75NE089097 represents the type location and is in NASIS. Pedon 08NE005040 has been sampled for the SSL.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
