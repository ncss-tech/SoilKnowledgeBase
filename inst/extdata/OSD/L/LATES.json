Elevation ranges from 1,600 to 2,700 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 90 percent.  These soils have a coastal marine climate with cool wet winters and cool dry summers.  Average annual precipitation is 70 to 120 inches.  The average January temperature is about 28 degrees F; the average July temperature is about 60 degrees F; the average annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 150 to 180 days."
