  "STATES": "OR,WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lates series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from basalt and basaltic breccia with an admixture of volcanic ash.  Lates soils are on mountain slopes at elevations of 1,600 to 2,700 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 100 inches and average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
