    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 14 to 25 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 30 percent by volume. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the solum, and from neutral to moderately alkaline in the C horizon.  Carbonates are deeper than 80 inches but reaction may be very slightly effervescent within 40 inches.\nThe O horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value 2 or 2.5, and chroma 2 or 3.  It is slightly decomposed plant material to highly decomposed plant material.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5 YR or 10 YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1.  Dry value is 5 or less.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is fine sandy loam or loam. Structure is very weak to moderate, fine or very fine granular. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2 and has redoximorphic features. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.\nTexture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Texture ranges to coarse sand below 40 inches. Structure is massive. Consistence is firm or friable."

The mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 55 inches, mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F., and the frost-free period ranges from 120 to 150 days. Elevation ranges from 1200 to 1600 feet above sea level."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series name is derived from nearby brook.\nDiagnostic horizons and feature in this pedon include:\n1. Cambic horizon - the zone between 9 and 18 inches (Bg horizon)\n2. Aquic conditions - evidenced by redoximorphic features below the surface layer (Bg horizon), a 2 chroma matrix and redox concentrations within 20 inches of the soil surface, and an aquic soil moisture regime.\n3. Endosaturation - saturation in all layers from the upper boundary of saturation to a depth of 200 cm. from the mineral soil surface.\n4. Mollic subgroup - color value, moist, of 3 or less and color value, dry, of 5 or less in the upper 15 cm. after mixing (A horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
