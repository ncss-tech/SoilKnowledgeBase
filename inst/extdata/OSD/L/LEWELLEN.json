  "OVERVIEW": "The Lewellen series consists of very deep somewhat poorly drained soils on flood plains.  They formed in 20 to 40 inches of loamy over sandy alluvium underlain by coarse sand to gravelly coarse sand.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and rapid or very rapid in the substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
