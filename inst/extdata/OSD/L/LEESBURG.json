  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness exceeds 60 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 6 feet.  Where the soil has not been limed, reaction in each horizon ranges from strongly acid to very strongly acid.  Content of coarse fragments, mostly rounded and some angular sandstone pebbles, cobbles or stones ranges from 10 to about 30 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The A horizon is gravelly, cobbly, or stony loam, sandy loam, or silt loam.\nSome pedons have an E or BE horizon, 3 to 6 inches thick, that has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 6 or 8. The lower part of the Bt\nhorizon is commonly mottled in shades of yellow, brown, and red. Texture of the fine earth is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  The weighted average clay content of the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon\nranges from 20 to 30 percent and silt content is more than 35 percent.\nIn some pedons, at depths of more than 40 inches, the lower Bt horizon formed in residuum weathered from sandstone or shale.  Texture of the fine-earth is clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, or clay.  Some pedons have hue of 5YR below 40 inches."

Addielou soils have A horizons thicker than 20 inches.  Allen, Avilla, Etowah, Holston, Nella,  Ruston, and Smithdale soils have all or some part of the Bt horizon in hues of 5YR or redder. Dubach soils contain horizons influenced by plinthite. Holston and Norfolk soils have less than 10 percent coarse fragments. Lytle soils formed from loess-mantled coastal plain sediments. Octavia soils are underlain by clay. Ruston soils are bisequal, with a glossic horizon in the lower part. Sailes soils formed in Tertiary-aged formations containing glauconitic parent materials. Silsbee soils formed in loamy sediments of the Lissie Formation of early to mid Pleistocene age. Warnock soils are modertely well drained."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Leesburg soils are on gently sloping to very steep side slopes, toe slopes, or terraces.  Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent.  The soil formed in loamy alluvium or colluvium underlain by sandstone, shale, or limestone.  Near the type location, mean annual rainfall is 55 inches and mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F."
