  "OVERVIEW": "The Lilapoint series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Lilapoint soils are on mountain drainageways.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 35 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 5.2 degrees C.",
