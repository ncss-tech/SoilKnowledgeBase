    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Linton soils are on level to moderately steep loess covered terraces and uplands.  Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent.  The soil formed in calcareous loess containing a large amount of silt and very fine sand.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 12 to 18 inches.  Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer."

They have a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches thick.  Lambert soils are on nearby steep slopes and crests of hills.  They do not have a mollic epipedon.  Temvik soils are on higher lying till plains where the loess thickness is 26 to 40 inches."
