  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lyra soils are on hills, mountains and side slopes of fan piedmont remnants with a rock core.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sedimentary rocks such as shale, sandstone, tuffs or conglomerate.  Slopes are 15 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,710 to 2,350 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 100 days."
