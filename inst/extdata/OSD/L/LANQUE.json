  "OVERVIEW": "The Lanque series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fan and stream alluvium from granite and gneiss.  Lanque soils are on fan terraces and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
