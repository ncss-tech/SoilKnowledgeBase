    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lasil soils are on smooth to channeled low lake terraces and lake plains.  They formed in calcareous lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 4,500 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 65 to 75 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 190 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 9 inches (E and EB horizons).\nAlbic horizon - The zone from the soil surface to 9 inches (E and EB horizons).\nNatric horizon - The zone from 9 to 19 inches (Btkn1 and Btkn2 horizons).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 9 to 29 inches (Btkn1, Btkn2, and Bk horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 30 and 50 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the C horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 9 to 19 inches (Btkn1 and Btkn2 horizons).\nThe revision of April 2005 updated the taxonomic class from Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Natrustalfs based on the assumed moisture regime being xeric instead of ustic.\nThe Lasil series is currently mapped in three soil survey areas in Utah.  There are some phases which have the average depth to the seasonal high saturation within 30 inches of the soil surface.  Such phases should classify in the subgroup of Aquic Natrixeralfs.  Future study is needed to determine whether a new series concept should be developed for these wetter phases of Lasil or whether they should be correlated to the Arave series.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 122-123, Table 7 of the Soil Survey of Salt Lake Area, Utah.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
