  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 9 inches (E and EB horizons).\nAlbic horizon - The zone from the soil surface to 9 inches (E and EB horizons).\nNatric horizon - The zone from 9 to 19 inches (Btkn1 and Btkn2 horizons).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 9 to 29 inches (Btkn1, Btkn2, and Bk horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 30 and 50 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the C horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 9 to 19 inches (Btkn1 and Btkn2 horizons).\nThe revision of April 2005 updated the taxonomic class from Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Natrustalfs based on the assumed moisture regime being xeric instead of ustic.\nThe Lasil series is currently mapped in three soil survey areas in Utah.  There are some phases which have the average depth to the seasonal high saturation within 30 inches of the soil surface.  Such phases should classify in the subgroup of Aquic Natrixeralfs.  Future study is needed to determine whether a new series concept should be developed for these wetter phases of Lasil or whether they should be correlated to the Arave series.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data."
