Elevation ranges from 4,800 to 5,200 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches including 20 to 30 inches of snow.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F.  The mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F. and the mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
