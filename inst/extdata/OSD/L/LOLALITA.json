  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Lolalita soils are on level to very steep uplands and terraces at elevations of 2,000 to 4,500 feet. Many areas have south facing slopes. Slopes range from 0 to 75 percent. The soil formed chiefly in unconsolidated sediments from intrusive acid igneous rocks.  The climate is semiarid and summers are dry. The average freeze-free period is 110 to 170 days, and the average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, including 1 to 2.5 feet of snow."
