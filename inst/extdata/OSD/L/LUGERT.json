    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 20 to more than 40 inches.  Depth to secondary carbonates ranges from 15 to 36 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6; hue of 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6; and hue of 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is the same as the A horizon.  Strata of soil material occur in the Bk horizon that are 1 to 2 units darker than the matrix.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Ck horizon has color and texture like the Bk horizon.  Thin alternating strata of more clayey or sandy layers occur below a depth of 30 inches."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Keokuk series in the same family.  Soils in similar families are Asher, Ashport, Easpur, Lamkin, Pocasset, Pursley, Reinach, and Spur series.  Asher, Ashport, and Lamkin soils have fine-silty control sections.  Easpur, Pursley, and Spur soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Keokuk soils are moist for longer periods.  Pocasset soils have coarse-loamy control sections.  Reinach soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lugert soils are on nearly level flood plains in the Central Rolling Red Plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  They formed in alluvial sediments of Recent age.  Climate is dry subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 28 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 65 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 34 to 44.  Frost free day range from 190 to 220.  Elevation ranges from 1000 to 2250 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",

Clairemont soils lack mollic epipedons, have fine-silty control section, and occur on similar areas.  Hardeman soils lack mollic epipedons, have coarse-loamy control sections, and occur on adjacent terraces.  Port soils have fine-silty control sections, have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick, and occur further from the stream channel."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Lugert soils were formerly included in the Port series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of approximately 16 inches (Ap and A horizons).\nCambic horizon - zone from 16 to 42 inches.  (Bk horizon).\nFluventic feature - the occurrence of irregular distribution of organic matter, in the form of strata, from approximately 16 to 50 inches (Bk and Ck horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
