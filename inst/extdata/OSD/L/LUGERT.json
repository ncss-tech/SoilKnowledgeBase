  "OVERVIEW": "The Lugert series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium of Recent age.  These soils are on nearly level flood plains in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78C).  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 25 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F.",

Depth to secondary carbonates ranges from 15 to 36 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6; hue of 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6; and hue of 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is the same as the A horizon.  Strata of soil material occur in the Bk horizon that are 1 to 2 units darker than the matrix.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Ck horizon has color and texture like the Bk horizon.  Thin alternating strata of more clayey or sandy layers occur below a depth of 30 inches."

Asher, Ashport, and Lamkin soils have fine-silty control sections.  Easpur, Pursley, and Spur soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Keokuk soils are moist for longer periods.  Pocasset soils have coarse-loamy control sections.  Reinach soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick."

Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 34 to 44.  Frost free day range from 190 to 220.  Elevation ranges from 1000 to 2250 feet."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Lugert soils were formerly included in the Port series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of approximately 16 inches (Ap and A horizons).\nCambic horizon - zone from 16 to 42 inches.  (Bk horizon).\nFluventic feature - the occurrence of irregular distribution of organic matter, in the form of strata, from approximately 16 to 50 inches (Bk and Ck horizons)."
