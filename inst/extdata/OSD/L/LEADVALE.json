  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to fragipan ranges from 16 to 38 inches.  Depth to rock, most commonly shale, ranges from about 4 to more than 8 feet.  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Weathered shale fragments or pebbles in each horizon of the solum range from 0 to about 10 percent by volume. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid except where limed.  Base saturation below the Ap horizon is less than 35 percent, and most commonly it is less than 20 percent.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Some pedons have A horizons less than 6 inches thick that have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or rarely loam or fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a thin transitional horizon with similar color and texture to the adjacent horizons.  The Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons have brown and red mottles, and in some pedons there is a 3 to 5 inch thick layer just above the fragipan which has mottles of chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam, which contains between 20 and 32 percent clay and from about 3 to 15 percent fine sand and coarser.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons lack a matrix color and are mottled.  The Bx horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam. The characteristics of the horizon below the fragipan are variable. This horizon ranges from a C horizon having massive or coarse platy relict rock structure and few to many shale fragments to a Bt horizon having blocky structure and clay films.  Color is similar to the Btx horizon.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Leadvale soils are on slightly concave toeslopes, benches, and terraces.  Slope gradients are mostly between 2 and 7 percent and range from 0 to 15 percent.  They formed in silty materials in the uplands or local silty alluvium from nearby uplands underlain largely by shale and siltstone.  In some places in the watershed, there are sandstone, phyllite, and slate.  Average annual air temperature is 59.1 degrees F. and average annual rainfall is 50 inches near the type location."

None of these soils have a fragipan.  In addition, Armuchee, Enders, and Sequoia soils have a clayey control section.  Litz and Montevallo soils are loamy-skeletal."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Leadvale soils are moderately well drained.  Runoff is slow or medium and permeability is slow or moderately slow. A perched water table is at a depth of 2 to 3 feet late in Winter and early in the spring."
