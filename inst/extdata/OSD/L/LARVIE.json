  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to mudstone or clay shale bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Clay content exceeds 60 percent in most horizons.  Gilagi microrelief is in most areas of the soil.  The soil contains carbonates throughout and is slightly or moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Bss horizon has hue of 10YR to 10R, value of 4 to 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Some pedons have accumulations of gypsum.\nThe Bkss horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 10R, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It contains from 5 to 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Some pedons have accumulation of gypsum and other salts.\nSome pedons have a C horizon that is multi-colored and reflects the varigated color of the mudstone.\nThe Cr horizon is soft clay shale or mudstone."

Kyle, Pierre, Swanboy, Wasa, Winler, and Twotop soils have yellower hue in the lower part of the profile.  In addition, Kyle, Swanboy, and Twotop soils do not have bedrock above depths of 40 inches and Wasa soils have visible salts within  depths of 8 inches of the surface.  Whitewater soils have a high SAR and formed in sodium rich materials."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Larvie soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping uplands and typically have convex surfaces.  Slope gradients typically are 2 to 6 percent, but range from 0 to 15 percent.  Larvie soils formed on the ridges in a gilgai landscape.  Larvie soils formed in residuum weathered from variegated shales and mudstones.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 18 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Conata, Hisle, Metre and Norrest soils.  Conata soils have bedrock within a depth of 20 inches and are on nearby steep slopes.  Hisle soils have a natric horizon and are in slightly concave areas.  Metre soils are in the furrows of a gilgai landscape.  They have mollic colors at depths greater than 8 inches.  Norrest soils have a fine textured argillic horizon.  They are on smooth ridges and sideslopes."
