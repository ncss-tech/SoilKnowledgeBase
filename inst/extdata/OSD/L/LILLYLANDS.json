  "OVERVIEW": "The Lillylands series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium derived dominantly from sandstone and mixed materials.  Lillylands soils are on moderately steep to steep mountain slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Rock fragments range from 5 to 10 percent in the A horizon.  They are dominantly pebbles and cobbles.  The C horizon has a rock fragment range of 5 to 35 percent.  Pebbles, cobbles, and stones are all common.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2. The 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is gravelly clay or clay."
