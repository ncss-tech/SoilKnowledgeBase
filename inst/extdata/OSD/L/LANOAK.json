  "OVERVIEW": "The Lanoak series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and silty alluvium derived from loess. Permeability is moderate.  These soils are on foothills, ridges, fan terraces, and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Camelback soils have argillic horizons and are loamy-skeletal.  Hades soils have argillic horizons and are fine-loamy.  Hondoho soils are loamy-skeletal and have calcic horizons.  Rexburg soils are coarse-silty, have calcic horizons, and lack pachic epipedons.  Ricrest soils are fine-loamy and have calcic horizons.  Ridgecrest soils are moderately deep to bedrock and are loamy-skeletal.  Camelback, Ricrest, and Ridgecrest soils are on mountain slopes above the Lanoak soils.  Hades and Hondoho soils are on terrace breaks.  Rexburg and Bancroft soils are on linear south and west-facing slopes where associated with Lanoak soils."
