They formed in loess and silty alluvium derived from loess.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 70 to 100 days.  Elevation is 4,500 to 6,600 feet."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Camelback, Hades, Hondoho, Rexburg, Ricrest, Ridgecrest, and the competing Bancroft series.  Camelback soils have argillic horizons and are loamy-skeletal.  Hades soils have argillic horizons and are fine-loamy.  Hondoho soils are loamy-skeletal and have calcic horizons.  Rexburg soils are coarse-silty, have calcic horizons, and lack pachic epipedons.  Ricrest soils are fine-loamy and have calcic horizons.  Ridgecrest soils are moderately deep to bedrock and are loamy-skeletal.  Camelback, Ricrest, and Ridgecrest soils are on mountain slopes above the Lanoak soils.  Hades and Hondoho soils are on terrace breaks.  Rexburg and Bancroft soils are on linear south and west-facing slopes where associated with Lanoak soils."
