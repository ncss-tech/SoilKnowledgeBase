  "OVERVIEW": "The Levenmile series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium mainly from granitic rocks.  Levenmile soils are on bajadas.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
