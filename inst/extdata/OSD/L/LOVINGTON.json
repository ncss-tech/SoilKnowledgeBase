  "OVERVIEW": "The Lovington series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils. These soils formed in calcareous, loamy lacustrine deposits of Quaternary age. Lovington soils are on nearly level playa steps and interdunes. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in), and mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C. (61 degrees F).",
