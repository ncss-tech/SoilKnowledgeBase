    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Labelle soils were formerly included with the Bernard and Morey series. The series was separated from the Bernard series by amount of rainfall. Morey soils are in a fine-silty family. The series description was updated during the update of MLRA 150A in 2013. The site remained the same but description was changed to one with laboratory data.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 21 to 71 cm (8 to 28 in). (Bt and Btss1 horizon)\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 55 cm (0 to 22 in). (Ap,A, Bt horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 21 to 203 cm (8 to 80 in). (Bt, Btss1, Btss2, Btkssg1, Btkssg2 horizons)\nAdditional Comments: The Btss1 horizon has mollic colors but fails to meet mollic epipedon criteria by having very hard consistence.\nADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL Data from type location on pedon 88TX245002. Additional data on pedons 59TX24006, S11TX0713298 and S10TX0713683.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
