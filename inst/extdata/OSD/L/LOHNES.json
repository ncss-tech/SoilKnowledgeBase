  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon commonly is more than 14 inches thick but ranges from 10 to 20 inches in thickness.  The 10- to 40- inch control section typically is coarse sand, sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand.  It averages up to 5 percent by volume coarse fragments, most of which are 2 to 10 mm in diameter.  Depth to carbonates ranges from more than 10 inches to less than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.  Chroma of 2 is allowed below a depth of 7 inches.  The A horizon is coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, coarse sandy loam or sandy loam.  The A and AC horizons are neutral or slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon with textures of coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand or loamy sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has few or common redoximorphic features below 40 inches in some pedons.  It is coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand or loamy sand.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  A thin dark colored layer is below depths of 30 inches in some pedons.  Some pedons have loamy glacial till below depths of 40 inches."

In addition, Hubbard soils are neutral or acid throughout.  Kost and Maddock soils have less than 30 percent medium sand and coarser.  Sandberg soils have 2 to 35 percent rock fragments in the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slope gradients typically are less than 2 percent but range to 15 percent.  The soils formed in poorly sorted coarse and medium sands of mixed mineralogy.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 22 inches.  Three-fourths of the precipitation falls during the growing season."

They do not have a mollic epipedon.  Hecla and Maddock soils are on nearby lake and outwash plains.  Hecla soils have redoximorphic features higher in the profile."
