Elevation ranges from 5,800 to 6,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."

Abrojo soils have a glassy mineralogy class, occur on backslopes of undulating plateaus, canyons, and mesas, and formed in colluvium over residuum derived from volcanic ash and pumice. Chiminet soils are glassy, occur on backslopes of mesas, canyons and undulating plateaus, and formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from volcanic ash, tuff, and pumice. Romberg soils have mixed mineralogy, are on backslopes of hills and formed in alluvium derived from conglomerate.  Zacaton soils are glassy, occur on lower north-facing backslopes of mesas, canyons and undulating plateaus, and formed in colluvium over residuum derived from pumice and volcanic ash."

(A1 and A2 horizon)\nArgillic horizon: The zone from 7 to 25 inches. (Bt and Btk horizons)\nVitrandic feature - based on high glass content and oxalate values in the Btk horizon (17 to 25 inches)\nSecondary carbonates: From 17 to 39 inches (Btk, Bk1, and 2Bk2 horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity: About 32 inches\nAniso feature: Loamy at 7 to 23 inches; ashy at 23 to 32 inches, and pumiceous or cindery at 32 to 40 inches.\nThe classification was changed from fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplargids to fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Calciargids in 2003. In 2005, the type location was visited and re-described.  The 12/2006 revision changes the typical pedon. The classification was also changed to ashy over pumiceous or cindery, aniso, glassy, mesic Vitrandic Haplargids.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Calcium carbonate equivalence was determined using a calcimeter. Volcanic glass contents were estimated based on lab data of similar soils in the area. Acid oxalates were estimated based on lab data of similar soils in the area.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
