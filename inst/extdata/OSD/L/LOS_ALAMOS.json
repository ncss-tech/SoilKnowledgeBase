Chiminet soils are glassy, occur on backslopes of mesas, canyons and undulating plateaus, and formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from volcanic ash, tuff, and pumice. Romberg soils have mixed mineralogy, are on backslopes of hills and formed in alluvium derived from conglomerate.  Zacaton soils are glassy, occur on lower north-facing backslopes of mesas, canyons and undulating plateaus, and formed in colluvium over residuum derived from pumice and volcanic ash."

In 2005, the type location was visited and re-described.  The 12/2006 revision changes the typical pedon.
