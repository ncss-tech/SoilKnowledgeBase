    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lostvalley soils occur on nearly level to strongly sloping basalt tablelands and calderas at elevations of 5,300 to 6,200 feet.  Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium and loess from basalt and volcanic ash.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation is 330 to 410 mm, and average annual temperature is 5.0 to 7.2 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 70 to 90 days."

Merlin soils are less than 50 cm to a lithic contact and lack an abrupt textural change.  These soils are all on similar landscape positions."
