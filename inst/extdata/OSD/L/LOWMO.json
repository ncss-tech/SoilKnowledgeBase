    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were previously mapped Eudora, Grable, and Haynie soils in Missouri. They differ from these soils by having a cambic horizon.\nRedox concentrations in the upper part of the profile are not indicative of current drainage conditions.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 38 centimeters (15 inches) (Ap1 Ap2, and A horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from approximately 38 to 102 centimeters (15 inches to 40 inches) (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data; University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri; Pedon ID M0621901 is data for the OSD typical pedon; Pedon IDs M0713901, M0613903, M0718309, M0718311, M0718312, M0702701, M0702702, M0702704, M0702705, M0707102, M0718304, M0718305, and M0721908 are additional data used for the series range in characteristics.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
