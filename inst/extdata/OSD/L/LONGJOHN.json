  "OVERVIEW": "The Longjohn series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived primarily from rhyolite.  Longjohn soils are on mountainsides with slopes of 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 800 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
