Dunbridge and Oneco soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Falleaf, Pana, and Razort soils do not have two lithologic discontinuities (3 parent materials) within the series control section. Longlois soils have more than 12 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Lydick soils have textures that contain less than 50 percent silt in the upper part of the series control section. Mohawk soils have pararock fragments of black or dark gray shale."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lauramie soils are on till plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. The soils formed in 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches) of loess and in the underlying glaciofluvium and loamy till. The till contains strata of coarser textured material in many places. Sand and gravel is within a depth of 2.4 to 3.6 meters (8 to 12 feet) in many places. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1092 mm (36 to 43 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 12.2 degrees C (48 to 54 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days."
