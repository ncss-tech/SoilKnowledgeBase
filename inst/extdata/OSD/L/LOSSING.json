  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is 10 inches or less and corresponds to the thickness of the silty clay material.  Lossing soils are calcareous throughout or within a depth of 10 inches.  The silty clay material extends to a depth of 6 to 10 inches.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline below the A horizon.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay with a clay content of 40 to 60 percent and 1 to 7 percent sand.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2.   The Bg horizon is silty clay with 40 to 55 percent clay and 1 to 7 percent sand.  In some pedons part or all of this horizon has been incorporated into the Ap horizon.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 20 percent sand.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2.  Pedons having a thin layer with a value of 3 or less are not excluded from the series.  Texture centers on silt loam and very fine sandy loam but individual strata within the 2Cg of fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, and silty clay loam are within the range of the series.  It contains 15 to 24 percent clay and 15 to 50 percent sand.  Pedons with silty clay layers below 40 inches are not excluded.\nThe 3Cg horizon has hue value and chroma that are the same as in 2Cg horizon.  Texture is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam with 02 to 10 percent clay and 45 to 60 percent sand.  Strata where present are similar as in the 2Cg horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lossing soils are on slight rises on nearly level flood plains.  Slope gradient is 0 to 2 percent.  Lossing soils formed in about 6 to 10 inches of recently deposited clayey alluvium underlain by silty and loamy alluvium.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 47 to 55 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 20 to 36 inches.  Annual frost free days range from 135 to 165 days. Elevation ranges from 700 to 1260 feet above means sea level."

Albaton soils are in lower landscape positions, are silty clay throughout and are poorly drained.  Blake, Modale and Onawa are in similar landscape positions.  Blake soils are silty clay loam to a depth of 18 to 35 inches.  Modale soils have silty clay substrata at a depth of 18 to 30 inches.  Onawa soils have silty clay textures 18 to 30 inches deep.  Owego and Rodney soils are at slightly lower elevations, have silty clay textures in the lower part of the family control section and are poorly drained."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  It is believed that the seasonal high water table was at a depth of 0 to 1 foot when these soils formed.  Due to down-cutting of nearby streams, the current depth to seasonal high water table is 2 to 4 feet.  In dry areas, the seasonal high water table is at a depth of 2 to 5 feet.  Permeability is slow in the upper part and moderate in the lower part.  Runoff is slow.  These soils are subject to rare or occasional flooding for brief periods.  Flooding is limited where these soils are protected by dams and levees."
