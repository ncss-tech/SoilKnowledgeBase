  "OVERVIEW": "The Lostspring series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in outwash material weathered from andesite ad pyroclastic rocks; the overburden is formed from air-laid pumice deposits.  Lostspring soils are on outwash terraces and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The discontinuity ranges from a depth of 20 to 36 inches. Pumice cinder content averages 40 to 90 percent by volume in the upper part of the particle-size control section. Pebble content ranges from 15 to 25 percent in the lower part of the control section.  Mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 47 degrees F and the mean summer soil temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F. The soil is dry in the 24 to 41 inch moisture control section from mid-July to mid-October. It is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year. An O horizon in some pedons is less than 1 inch thick.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/3, 5/1, 6/1, 6/2, 7/2 or 7/3 and moist color of 10YR 2/1, 3/1, 3/3, 4/2, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3 or 6/4. It is coarse sandy loam to sand with 15 to 90 percent pumice cinders. It is slightly acid or medium acid.\nThe 2Bwb horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/2, 6/3, or 5/4 and 7.5YR 5/4, 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3 or 4/4 and 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 4/6, 3/4 or 3/6. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam with 5 to 35 percent gravel and cobbles by volume. It is weak, medium or coarse subangular blocky structure. It is slightly acid or neutral."

Slopes are O to 30 percent. The soils are formed in pumice cinders deposited over a soil formed from outwash material weathered from pyroclastic and andesitic flow rock.\nThe climate is continental and subhumid with warm, nearly dry summers and cold, moist winters. mean annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches.  Snowfall is 20 to 45 inches and lasts from early December until early May in most years. Mean January temperature is 25 degrees to 30 degrees F; the mean July temperature is 60 degrees to 65 degrees F; the mean annual temperature is 38 degrees to 45 degrees F. Frost-free season is 40 to 65 days."
