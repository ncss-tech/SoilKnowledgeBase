  "REVDATE": "05/2011",
  "STATES": "CO,MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Loberg series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till, alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on till plains, moraines, alluvial fans, mountains, hills or landslides.  Slopes are 2 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
