Further investigation is needed. Saturated hydraulic conductivity needs to be reviewed. With the high clay content in the argillic horizon and based on geographically associated soils ksat's, it may be low instead of moderately low.\n06/2020 BKN Updated site information for Typical Pedon and added USGS QUAD to Type Location.
