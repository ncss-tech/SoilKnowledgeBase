Depth to hard bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is loam or silt loam and has 10 to 18 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 30 to 50 percent gravel and 5 to 25 percent cobbles.\nThe bedrock is massive to fractured sandstone and siltstone."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Goulding and Vermisa series.  Goulding soils have 20 to 30 percent clay in the B horizon and contains more than 50 percent coarse and very coarse sand and the clay is dominated by kaolinite and vermiculite.  The Vermisa soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the B horizon and are dry in the soil moisture control section for 60 to 80 days.  Vermisa soils are derived from metavolcanic rocks."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Larmine soils are on very narrow ridgetops, steep sideslopes and headwalls in mountainous areas.  They have slopes of 12 to 90 percent.  Elevations range from 250 to 3,000 feet.  The soils formed in colluvium weathered from sandstone and siltstone of the Tyee, Flournoy and Lookingglass formations.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and dry warm summers with precipitation ranging from 30 to 60 inches.  Mean January temperature is 39 degrees F., the mean July temperature is 66 degrees F., and the average temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 160 to 235 days."

Kanid soils are greater than 40 inches to a paralithic contact and average greater than 18 percent clay in the control section.
