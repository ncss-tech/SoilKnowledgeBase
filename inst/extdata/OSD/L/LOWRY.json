Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  Buried horizons are below a depth of 30 inches in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons do not have accumulations of carbonate in the lower Bw horizon.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has common to many, fine to coarse, accumulations and striations of carbonate.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 to 7, 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 2 or 4.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam and has a gradual increase in fine sand with depth.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline."

Slope gradients range from 0 to 15 percent, but typically are less than 6 percent.  Lowry soils formed in calcareous silty sediments of recent eolian origin.  The thickness of these sediments ranges from 3 to about 20 feet.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F, and precipitation ranges from about 15 to 24 inches."
