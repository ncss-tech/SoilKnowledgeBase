  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates ranges from 8 to 20 inches;  The control section is silt loam averaging less than 18 percent clay, less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser, and more than 68 percent silt and very fine sand.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  Buried horizons are below a depth of 30 inches in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons do not have accumulations of carbonate in the lower Bw horizon.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has common to many, fine to coarse, accumulations and striations of carbonate.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 to 7, 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 2 or 4.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam and has a gradual increase in fine sand with depth.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Graybert and Kenesaw soils in the same family. The Graybert and Kenesaw soils do not have distinct Bk horizons and typically are deeper to carbonates.  In addition Graybert soils have buried horizons within depths of 20 and 34 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Lowry soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping uplands and terraces.  Surfaces are plane or convex.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 15 percent, but typically are less than 6 percent.  Lowry soils formed in calcareous silty sediments of recent eolian origin.  The thickness of these sediments ranges from 3 to about 20 feet.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F, and precipitation ranges from about 15 to 24 inches."

Sully soils do not have a mollic epipedon are on similar to steeper landscapes. Agar, Eakin, and Highmore soils are on similar landscapes.  Glenham and Raber soils are on slightly higher landscapes.  In addition, Agar, Eakin, and Highmore soils have fine-silty control sections; Glenham soils have fine-loamy control sections; and Raber soils have clayey control sections."
