Domell soils have less than 18 percent apparent clay in the particle-size control section and an umbric epipedon less than 20 inches thick.  Lempira soils have a solum more than 60 inches thick.  Murtip soils have an umbric epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick.  Volash soils have a xeric moisture regime and slightly and or neutral."

The regolith consists of predominantly volcanic ash mixed with some pedons and residuum from igneous rocks. Larchmount soils occur in a humid marine climate having an annual precipitation of 90 to 100 inches with relatively cool dry summers and mild wet winters; an average January temperature of 30 degrees F.; and average July temperature of 60 degrees F., and an average annual temperature of 45 degrees F.; and an average growing season of 80 days."
