  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Larchmount series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and residuum and colluvium from igneous rock on mountain slopes at elevations from 1,800 to 3,000 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 75 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 95 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

The regolith consists of predominantly volcanic ash mixed with some pedons and residuum from igneous rocks. Larchmount soils occur in a humid marine climate having an annual precipitation of 90 to 100 inches with relatively cool dry summers and mild wet winters; an average January temperature of 30 degrees F.; and average July temperature of 60 degrees F., and an average annual temperature of 45 degrees F.; and an average growing season of 80 days."
