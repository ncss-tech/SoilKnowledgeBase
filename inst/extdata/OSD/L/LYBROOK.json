  "OVERVIEW": "The Lybrook series consists of very deep, well drained slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale and sandstone. Lybrook soils are on stream terraces and valley floors.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
