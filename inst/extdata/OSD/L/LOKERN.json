  "OVERVIEW": "The Lokern series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained clayey soils formed from mixed but predominantly granitic alluvium.  Lokern soils are on basins and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil between the depths of 4 to 12 inches is dry all the time from early in the spring to early in the winter and is moist for less than 60 consecutive days in all parts of the moisture control section during the winter.  Mean annual soil temperature is 65 degrees to 67 degrees F.  Salinity ranges from less than 2 to as much as 16 mmhos per cubic centimeter.  Saline-alkali phases are mapped.\nColor of the A horizon is 10YR 4/1, 4/2, or 5/1.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 3/1, or 3/2.  Texture is silty clay or clay with a clay content of 40 to 55 percent.  Unless irrigated, cracks on the surface range from less than 1mm to 2cm but are at least 1cm wide at a depth of 20 inches.  Slickensides do not intersect.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 3 percent to a depth of 20 inches and decreases irregularly with increasing depth.  Structure may range from weak and moderate granular in the upper part to weak and moderate subangular and angular blocky and moderate to strong prismatic in the lower part.\nColor of the C horizon is 10YR 4/1, 5/1, 5/2, 6/2; 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2 or 5Y 6/1, 6/2, 7/2.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 4/2, 6/2; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2; 5Y 4/1, or 5/3.  Some pedons have faint to prominent mottles of 10YR 5/6.  Moist color is 10YR 4/4 or 5/6.  Depth to the mottles is 20 to 24 inches.  Texture is dominantly clay.  Clay content ranges from 40 to 60 percent.  Structure is moderate angular and subangular blocky to moderate and strong prismatic.\nThe IIC horizon occurs at depths of 42 to 70 inches but usually at about 48 inches.  Color is 2.5Y 6/2, 7/2; 5Y 7/2, 6/3, or 6/6.  Moist color is 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2, 6/4; 5Y 5/2, 5/3, or 6/2.  Texture consists of stratified layers of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, and sandy clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 10 to 26 percent."

Arno soils have hue redder than 7.5YR in the C horizon and are effervescent throughout.  Buttonwillow soils have clayey over loamy control sections.  Lerdo soils are fine-loamy.  Gadsden and Imperial soils have mean annual soil temperature greater than 72 degrees F.  Guest soils are effervescent throughout and are moist in the upper part of the soil for up to 30 days or more during the summer months."
