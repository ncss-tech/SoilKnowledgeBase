  "OVERVIEW": "The Laposa series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in slope alluvium from schist, granite, gneiss, rhyolite and eolian deposits.  Laposa soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of about 10 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F.",
