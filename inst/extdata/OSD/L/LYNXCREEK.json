  "OVERVIEW": "The Lynxcreek series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments with a mantle of volcanic ash. Lynxcreek soils are on high terraces. Slopes are 20 to 40 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between a depth of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Thickness of the volcanic ash mantle ranges from 7 to 14 inches and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percnet, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples. The particle-size control section averages 5 to 15 percent coarse fragments and 18 to 35 percent clay. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry or moist. It is 0 to 5 percent pebbles.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry, 3 or 4 moist. Some pedons have distinct to prominent mottles. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is 5 to 10 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry, 3 or 4 moist. It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. It is 5 to 15 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles."
