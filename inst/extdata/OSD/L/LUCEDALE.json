  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 60 inches to more than 80 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10R, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid, except where limed.\nIn some pedons there is a sandy loam or loam BA horizon from 3 to 10 inches thick.  Color and reaction are similar to those of Bt1 horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 10R, value of 3, and chroma of 4 to 6.  The Bt horizon is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam.  The particle size control section, upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon, has 20 to 30 percent clay, and silt content ranges from 20 to 38 percent.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Red Bay is the only competing series in the same family.  Closely related series include the Anniston, Caldonia, Greenville, Nacogdoches, Neshoba, Pine Flat, and Ruston series.  Red Bay soils have less than 20 percent silt in the Bt horizon.  Anniston, Greenville, Nacogdoches, and Neshoba soils have more than 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon.  Caldonia soils have base saturation of more than 35 percent.  Pine Flat soils have a coarse-loamy particle size class.  Ruston soils have moist values of 4 or more throughout the solum."

Eustis soils, which commonly are in slightly higher positions, have a sandy Bt horizon.  Lucy soils, which commonly are on more dissected parts of the terrain, have a thick sandy epipedon.  McLaurin soils, which are on associated hillsides, have a value of 4 or more throughout the solum and a coarse-loamy particle size class."
