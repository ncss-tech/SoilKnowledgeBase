The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F.  The A1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, values of 2 or 3 moist and 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or fine sandy loam; and is moderately or strongly calcareous; the B2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, light clay loam or heavy fine sandy loan, and is moderately or strongly calcareous.  The Cca horizon is loam, or light clay loam in the upper part and gravelly loam or gravelly sandy loam in the lower part.  It has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 moist and 7 or 8 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The Cca horizon is strongly or very strongly calcareous and strongly or very strongly alkaline.  Mottles range from few to common.  Depth to seasonal high water table ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Gravel and cobble content in the lower Cca horizon ranges from 20 to 50 percent."

Greenson soils are fine-silty family and have less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand in the control section.  Roshe Springs soils are carbonatic."

The parent material is strongly calcareous mixed alluvium.  Local areas are subject to overflow periodically.  These soils are at elevations of 5,000 to 5,500 feet.  The climate is semi-arid.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 110 to 130 days."
