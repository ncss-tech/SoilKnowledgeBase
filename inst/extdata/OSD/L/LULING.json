  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 50 to about 80 inches.  Clay content of the control section ranges from 40 to 55 percent.  Iron-manganese concretions range from none to few throughout, but are commonly in the lower part.  Undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microknolls 6 to 12 inches higher than microdepressions. Distance between the center of the microknoll and center of microdepression ranges from 4 to about 12 feet.  The microknoll makes up about 20 percent, the intermediate, or area between the knoll and depression about 50 percent, and the depression about 30 percent.  When dry, the soil has cracks 1/2 to 2 inches wide at the surface and commonly 1/2 inch wide cracks extend to a depth of more than 40 inches during the summer.  The cracks remain open for more than 90 cumulative days during most years.  Slickensides are at a depth 12 to 24 inches and extend throughout the solum.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  It is typically noncalcareous in the A horizon and calcareous or noncalcareous below.\nIn more than half of each pedon the A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 or 3 to a depth of at least 12 inches.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  The amplitude of waviness between the A and the Bss horizon is 5 to 18 inches.\nThe Bss horizon, or Bkss horizon where present, have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. Low chroma colors are lithochromic and not due to wetness.  Texture is predominantly clay, but some pedons are silty clay.  Redox concentrations in shades of brown, yellow, and olive range from none to common.  Concretions and masses of calcium carbonates range from none to common.\nThe Bssy horizon, or Bkssy horizon where present, have colors in shades of brown, gray, yellow and olive.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  Crystals and masses of gypsum range from 2 to 25 percent.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons contain few to common concretions and masses of calcium carbonate.\nThe C or Cy horizon has colors mainly in shades of gray, brown, yellow, or olive.  It is weathered shale with clay texture or clay with interbedded fragments, strata, or spots of shale and/or thin strata of weakly consolidated sandstone.  Crystals and masses of gypsum range from 2 to 25 percent.  Calcium carbonate concretions or masses range from none to few.  Some pedons contain a few siliceous or ironstone pebbles mainly less than 1/2 inch in diameter."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Bleiblerville, Branyon, Burleson, Dimebox, Fairlie, Houston Black, Leson, Slidell,  Heiden, Ovan, Sanger, and Tamford series.  Bleiblerville, Branyon, Burleson, Dimebox, Fairlie, Houston Black, Leson and Slidell soils have chroma of 1 or less in the upper 12 inches of the surface in 50 percent or more of the pedon.  Heiden, Ovan and Sanger soils are calcareous throughout.  Tamford soils have red or reddish brown C horizons and annual air temperature of less than 65 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Luling soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping erosional uplands.  Slope gradients are 0 to 8 percent, but dominantly are 1 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in alkaline shale mainly of the Cook Mountain Geologic Formation.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 40 inches, and mean annual temperature is 67 to 70 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 260 to 280 days, and elevation ranges from 300 to 500 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E index is 42 to 60."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked, and very slowly when it is moist and the cracks are closed.  Runoff is low on slopes less than 1 percent, medium on 1 to 3 percent slopes, high on 3 to 5 percent slopes, and very high on 5 to 8 percent slopes."
