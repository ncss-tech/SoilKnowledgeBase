  "OVERVIEW": "The Lynnbow series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in thin loess over alluvium derived from mixed rocks and residuum derived from tuff.  The Lynnbow soils are on hills, pediments and fan piedmont remnants with a rock core.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
