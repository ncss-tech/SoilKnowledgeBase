  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F. and the soil temperature is never below 47 degrees F.  The soils are continuously moist in some part between depths of 4 and 12 inches from about December 1 until late May and are continuously dry the rest of the time.  Some pedons have up to 25 percent gravel in some or all horizons but particularly near the surface and near the lithic contact.  In addition to gravel, some of these pedons have up to 5 percent cobblestones.\nThe A horizon is brown to reddish brown (7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 4/2, 4/4, 3/2; 5YR 5/3, 5/4, 4/3, 4/4).  It is fine sandy loam, loam or clay loam and is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe B2t horizon is reddish brown, dark reddish  brown, red or dark red (2.5YR 4/4, 4/3, 4/6, 3/4, 3/6). It is heavy clay loam or clay and averages 35 to 45 percent clay.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon is yellowish red or pale brown."

The soils formed in material weathered from basic igneous rocks.  Some areas have up to 10 percent rock outcrop.  The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches.  The average January temperature is 48 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 72 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F.  The frost free season is 240 to 320 days."

Delpedra and Toomes soils have a lithic contact at a depth of  less than 20 inches.  Escondido soils lack an argillic horizon and have a coarse, loamy control section.  Honcut soils lack an argillic horizon and are coarse, loamy.  Yokohl soils have a strongly cemented duripan."
