  "STATES": "KY,MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lilbourn series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils formed in loamy alluvium of recent deposition over buried alluvium of an older age on nearly level to depressional terraces or natural levees.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about about 61 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about about 50 inches.",

It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe C1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2.  Mottles have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It commonly is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam, but a layer of loamy sand up to 15 inches thick is included within the range.  Some pedons have thin strata or lenses of sandy clay loam or loamy sand.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2Btb horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4, 5, or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles mainly have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is loam, silt loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through neutral.\nThe 2C and 3C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Thickness and sequence of the lower 2C horizon and 3C horizon are variable and commonly are sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand.

Enoree soils are wetter, more stratified, flood more frequently, and lack Btb horizons.  Caruthersville, Commerce, Convent, Falaya, and Vacherie soils have less than 15 percent of fine sand or coarser.  Caruthersville soils are also calcareous, and Vacherie soils are coarse-silty over clayey.  Iuka soils are siliceous and acid.  Nahatche soils are fine-loamy, and Wakeland soils are coarse-silty and mesic."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lilbourn soils are on nearly level to depressional terraces or natural levees of the Mississippi River Valley.  Slope gradients are 0 to 1 percent.  These soils formed in loamy alluvium of recent deposition over buried alluvium of what appears to be of an older age or period of deposition and a possible period of brief exposure to weathering.  Lilbourn soils seem to be closely associated geographically with \"sunken lands\" reportedly depressed at the time of the New Madrid earthquake of 1811-1812.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 55 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 65 degrees F."

Dundee soils have less than 20 inches of surface soil over a silty clay loam Bt horizon.  Canalou, Clana, Crevasse, Malden, and Scotco soils contain more sand and less clay to a depth of 5 feet.  Farrenburg soils lack mottles with chroma of 2 or less in the upper 20 inches.  Wardell soils have argillic horizons within 20 inches of the surface and are dominated by chroma of 1.  Gideon and Sikeston soils are wetter, are dominated by chroma of 1, and generally contain more clay throughout the solum."
