  "OVERVIEW": "The Laxal series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Laxal soils are on inset fans, fan piedmonts and fan skirts. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
