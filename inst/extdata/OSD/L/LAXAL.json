These soils formed in alluvium derived from shale, siltstone and undifferentiated Tertiary volcanics. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,370 to 1,890 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 150 days."
