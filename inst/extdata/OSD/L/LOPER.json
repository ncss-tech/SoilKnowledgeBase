    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The average annual soil temperature ranges from 49 to 5l degrees F.  The umbric epipedon is l0 to l5 inches thick.  The upper l4 to 20 inches of the soil is dominated by amorphous material.  The argillic horizon ranges from 35 to 60 percent clay.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to strongly acid throughout the profile.  Base saturation (by sum of cations) averages from l5 to 65 percent throughout the profile, and is more than 35 percent at 1.5 meters.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  It has 0 to l0 percent cobbles and 0 to l0 percent pebbles.\nThe Bt horizon has value and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  Texture is loam or clay loam, with 0 to 5 percent cobbles, 5 to l0 percent pebbles and 20 to 30 percent soft weathered pebbles.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hues of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist 4 through 6 dry.  Texture is clay loam or clay.  This horizon has 0 to 5 percent hard pebbles and 25 to 50 percent soft weathered pebbles."

These soils formed in basaltic colluvium with an admixture of volcanic ash and loess overlying highly weathered pyroclastic breccia.  The climate is marine with cool, dry summers and mild wet winters.  The average annual precipitation is 60 to 80 inches.  Average January temperature is about 37 degrees F., the average July temperature is about 6l degrees F., and the average annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 200 to 240 days."
