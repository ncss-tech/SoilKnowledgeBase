  "OVERVIEW": "The Loper series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in basalt colluvium with an admixture of volcanic ash and loess overlying highly weathered pyroclastic breccia, tuff, and tuff breccia.  Loper soils are on hillsides and benches.  Slopes are 20 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 70 inches and average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
