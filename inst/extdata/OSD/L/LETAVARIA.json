In addition, Goring soils have slightly acid or neutral soil reaction and have argillic horizons with hue of 7.5YR or redder.  Greentimber soils have buried Bt horizons that extend below 60 inches, have control sections with 35 to 45 percent clay and moderately acid or slightly acid soil reaction.  Prag soils are moderately deep over partially consolidated sediments.  Skullgulch soils have Bw horizons overlying the argillic, are 20 to 30 inches to the upper boundary of the argillic horizon and are more than 60 inches to the base of the argillic horizon."

The climate is characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches; mean annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees; the frost-free season is 90 to 100 days.  Slopes range from 4 to 15 percent."
