  "OVERVIEW": "The Lakin series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in coarse textured eolian or water-laid materials.  Lakin soils are located dominantly on the leeward side of major stream valleys. Permeability is rapid. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 38 to 44 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees to 57 degrees F.",

Volume of small pebbles ranges from 0 to 3 percent in the control section.  Unlimed soils are moderately acid to very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR,value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Some A horizons are 2 to 5 inches thick, and have value and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand.\nThe E part of the E and Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, and  value and chroma of 4 to 6.It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand.  The Bt part (lamellae or lumps) of the E and Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, and sand, with sandy loam or fine sandy loam in some lamellae. The lamellae in the E and Bt1 horizon are commonly discontinuous, 1/8 to 3/4 inch thick and usually have a combined total thickness of 1 inch or less.  Lamellae in the E and Bt2 horizon are 1/4 to 1-1/2 inches thick and have a combined total thickness of 5-1/2 inches or less.  The combined total thickness of the lamellae (Bt) in the particle-size controlsection is less than 6 inches.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR,value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is commonly loamy sand or sand, and less commonly sand and gravel to light sandy loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Chelsea, Coloma, and Colonie soil series are in the same family. All three competitors have contact with the uppermost lamellae at a depth greater than 26 inches, and are in areas that receive slightly lower annual precipitation. In addition, Coloma soils have reaction ranging from strongly acid to neutral in the lower E and Bt horizon and substratum, while Colonie soils are moderately acid to neutral below 40 inches and have a higher content of fine and very fine sand."

The Chavies, Duncannon, Gallipolis, Sciotoville, and Wheeling soils are on similar landscape positions. Chavies soils are coarse-loamy and have an argillic horizon. The Duncannon soils are coarse-silty and are on adjacent hillsides and dune-like slopes. The moderately well drained Gallipolis and Sciotoville soils are fine-silty and have an argillic horizon.  Wheeling soils are fine-loamy and have an argillic horizon."
