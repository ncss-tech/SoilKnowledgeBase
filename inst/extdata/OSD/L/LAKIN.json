  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is 40 to 80 inches or more. Depth to the uppermost lamellae is 10 to 26 inches.  Volume of small pebbles ranges from 0 to 3 percent in the control section.  Unlimed soils are moderately acid to very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR,value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Some A horizons are 2 to 5 inches thick, and have value and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand.\nThe E part of the E and Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, and  value and chroma of 4 to 6.It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand.  The Bt part (lamellae or lumps) of the E and Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, and sand, with sandy loam or fine sandy loam in some lamellae. The lamellae in the E and Bt1 horizon are commonly discontinuous, 1/8 to 3/4 inch thick and usually have a combined total thickness of 1 inch or less.  Lamellae in the E and Bt2 horizon are 1/4 to 1-1/2 inches thick and have a combined total thickness of 5-1/2 inches or less.  The combined total thickness of the lamellae (Bt) in the particle-size controlsection is less than 6 inches.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR,value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is commonly loamy sand or sand, and less commonly sand and gravel to light sandy loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Chelsea, Coloma, and Colonie soil series are in the same family. All three competitors have contact with the uppermost lamellae at a depth greater than 26 inches, and are in areas that receive slightly lower annual precipitation. In addition, Coloma soils have reaction ranging from strongly acid to neutral in the lower E and Bt horizon and substratum, while Colonie soils are moderately acid to neutral below 40 inches and have a higher content of fine and very fine sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lakin soils formed in coarse textured eolian or water-laid materials, and are located dominantly on the leeward side of main stream valleys. They are dominantly on risers and also on treads of terraces. Mean annual precipitation is about 38 to 44 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees to 57 degrees F."

The Chavies, Duncannon, Gallipolis, Sciotoville, and Wheeling soils are on similar landscape positions. Chavies soils are coarse-loamy and have an argillic horizon. The Duncannon soils are coarse-silty and are on adjacent hillsides and dune-like slopes. The moderately well drained Gallipolis and Sciotoville soils are fine-silty and have an argillic horizon.  Wheeling soils are fine-loamy and have an argillic horizon."
