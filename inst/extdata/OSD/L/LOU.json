  "OVERVIEW": "The Lou series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from granite grus of pre-Cambrian age. These gently sloping soils are on shoulders and summits of ridges and hills. Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 19 degrees C (66 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).",

Other grasses include sideoats grama, yellow Indiangrass, sandhill lovegrass, Arizona cottontop, fringeleaf paspalum, pinhole bluestem, vine mesquite and purpletop tridens. The dominant forbs include orange zexmenia, sagewort, snoutbean, and heath aster. The woody plants include post oak, blackjack oak and live oak. Continued heavy use causes further deterioration and plants such as mesquite, whitebrush, yucca, Ashe juniper, gummy lovegrass, Texas grama, prairie coneflower, and basin sneezeweed, invade or increase on the ecological site."
