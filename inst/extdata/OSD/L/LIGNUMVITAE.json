    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to soft to hard but rippable oolitic limestone or coral is dominantly 25 to 35 inches but the total range is 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  The soil has more than 90 percent calcium carbonate.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Where value is 4 or 5, chroma is 1.  Texture is marl with a non-carbonate free texture of silt or silt loam.  In some pedons, the lower part of the soil is massive and is a C horizon.  Percent by volume of coral or limestone fragments is less than 15 percent."

Competing series in other families are the  Cudjoe, Keywest, and Saddlebunch series and the Biscayne, Pennsuco, and Perrine series in hyperthermic families.  Cudjoe and Saddlebunch soils are shallow to bedrock and Keywest soils are deeper to bedrock.  In addition, Saddlebunch soils are better drained than all competing series, and have a subhorizon with a value of 5 or less with a chroma of 2 or 3."
