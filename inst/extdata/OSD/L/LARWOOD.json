The soil moisture regime is aridic bordering on xeric.\nThe particle size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay and contains less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has value of 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is neutral to slightly alkaline.  Texture is fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is slightly to moderately alkaline.  Texture is silty clay loam to clay loam.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam.
