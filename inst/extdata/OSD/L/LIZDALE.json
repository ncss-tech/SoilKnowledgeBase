  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lizdale series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from limestone, tuffaceous limestone and calcareous sandstone. They are on fan terraces, mountainsides and hillsides.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Slope is 4 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
