    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lamartine soils typically are on nearly level to sloping ridgetops and foot slopes of ground moraines and interdrumlin areas.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. These soils formed in loess and in the underlying loamy till.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 890 mm (27 to 35 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.2 to 11.7 degrees C (45 to 53 degrees F)."

The well drained Dodge and the moderately well drained Mayville are common associates on the somewhat steeper gradients.  Kendall soils are on nearby areas of similar slopes where loess thickens beyond 91 cm (36 inches)."
