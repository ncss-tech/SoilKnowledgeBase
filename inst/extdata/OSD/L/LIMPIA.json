They have formed in stony and gravelly colluvium material, mainly from volcanic hills and mountains.  Mean annual rainfall ranges from 10 to 16 inches and mean air temperature ranges from 60 to 66 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 210 to 240 days and elevation ranges from 3,500 to 4,500 feet."
