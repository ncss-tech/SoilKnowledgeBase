  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The La Taina series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on summits and side slopes in uplands of the serpentinite hills and mountains of the Humid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  They formed in material weathered from serpentinite bedrock.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 81 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches.  Slopes range from 5 to 90 percent.",

Depth to consolidated serpentinite bedrock ranges from 18 to 29 inches.  Reaction is neutral throughout.  Rock fragments include pebbles and cobbles composed of serpentinite.  The combined total of rock fragments in the control section is more than 35 percent, by volume.\nThe A horizons has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.  Content of pebbles and cobbles ranges from 8 to 65 percent, by volume.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.  Content of pebbles and cobbles range from 60 to 85 percent, by volume.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of highly fractured serpentinite.  It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools, and rippable by mechanized equipment.\nThe R horizon is composed of hard consolidated serpentinite bedrock."

Slopes range from 5 to 90 percent.  They formed in material that weathered from serpentinite bedrock.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 80 to 82 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 78 to 82 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the El Cacique (T), Maresua, Nipe, Rosario and Santa Marta soils.  All of these soils are on similar positions.  El Cacique soils are in the clayey family.  Maresua soils are moderately deep to serpentinite bedrock. Nipe, Rosario, and Santa Marta soils are redder, finer textured, and do not have the large amount of rock fragments throughout the profile.  In addition, the Nipe and Rosario soils are acid and have an oxic horizon."
