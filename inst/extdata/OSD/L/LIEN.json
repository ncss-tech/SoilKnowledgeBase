Further study is needed on the distinction between those soils and the concept of the Lien series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the surface to 18 cm (A and part of the Bk horizons).\nIndurated duripan - The zone from 20 to 61 cm (2Bqkm horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from the surface to 20 cm (A and Bk horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
