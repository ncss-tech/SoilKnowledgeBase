Calcium carbonate percentages indicate the need for the change.\nChanged to tabular format and included metric values.  Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - 0 to 42 cm (0 to 17 in). (A1, A2 and Bss horizons).\nCambic horizon - 42 to 140 cm (17 to 55 in). (A2, Bss, Bkss horizons).\nCalcic horizon - 140 to 203 cm (55 to 86 in). (Bk and BCkss horizons).\nVertic features - Slickensides from 28 to 139 cm (11 to 55 in), cracks 2 to 7 cm wide that extend from the surface to a depth of more than 50 cm when the soil is dry.  Cracks remain open from 150 to 210 cumulative days during most years. In undisturbed areas there is gilgai microrelief with mircohighs 10 to 30 cm higher than microlows.
