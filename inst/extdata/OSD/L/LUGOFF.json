    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is more than 65 inches in thickness.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout except for the surface layer in limed areas.  Rounded quartz pebbles commonly range from 15 to 40 percent in the A horizon, 15 to 45 in the E horizon, 15 to 35 percent in the upper Bt horizon and 0 to 20 percent in the lower Bt.  Some pedons have one or more stone lines in the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 3 to 5.  It is gravelly loamy sand or gravelly sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 5 to 6.  It has few to many mottles in the lower part in shades of red, yellow and brown.  It commonly is gravelly clay in the upper part and clay in the lower part; but in some pedons, it is gravelly clay throughout the Bt horizon; and some pedons have subhorizons of gravelly sandy clay loam, gravelly clay loam or gravelly sandy clay."

Dewey, Faceville, Fullerton, Summerton and Waynesboro soils have dominant hue of 5YR or redder in the series control section.  Esto soils are mottled in the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Henderson soils have 10 percent or more coarse fragments of chert.  Marlboro soils do not have gravelly textures in the Bt horizons.  Aycock, Carnegie, Dothan, Norfolk and Tifton soils have less than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Caroline, Collegedale, Shubuta, and Turbeville soils have mixed mineralogy.  Freemanville, Sunsweet and Varina soils have a horizon with more than 5 percent plinthite within a depth of 60 inches."

The soil formed in clayey Coastal Plain sediments.  Near the type location mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches, mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees, and the frost-free season is about 228 days."

In addition, Ailey and Wagram soils have surface layers more than 20 inches thick and generally are at higher positions on the landscape; Chewacla and Rains soils are at lower positions on the landscape and are more poorly drained;  Georgeville, Herndon and Nason soils generally are at lower positions on the landscape and formed in Carolina slates; Orangeburg soils have fine loamy textures in the particle-size control section."
