    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-February. May and June are the driest months. Typic aridic moisture regime.\nRock fragments - Averages less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section.\nDepth to petrocalcic - Dominantly 24 to 34 inches but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nSAR - 13 to 100 or more throughout.\nSalinity - Slightly saline to moderately saline; EC - 4 to 16 dS/m or more.\nRelict water table - In some pedons there is evidence of a relict perched water table in the B horizon.  Therefore, high and low chroma mottles are allowed in this horizon.\nA horizon\nHue: 10YR or 7.5YR\nValue: 5, 6 or 7 dry, 3, 4 or 5 moist\nChroma: 3 or 4 dry, 3, 4 or 6 moist\nTexture: Very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam\nOrganic matter: Less than 1 percent\nCarbonates:  Disseminated.\nBt horizon\nHue: 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 5, 6 or 7 dry, 4, 5 or 6 moist\nChroma: 3 or 4 dry, 3, 4 or 6 moist\nTexture: Very fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam\nStructure: Usually blocky but is columnar or prismatic in some pedons.\nBk horizon\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 5, 6, 7 or 8 dry, 5, 6 or 7 moist\nChroma: 2 or 3 dry, 3 or 4 moist\nTexture: Clay loam, loam\nCarbonates: Occur as soft lime masses and as nodules; calcium carbonate equivalent is 5 to 25 percent.  The horizon immediately above the petrocalcic horizon is calcic where it is thick enough.\nBm horizon\nThis lime-cemented pan occurs in two ways.  As a single horizon 4 to 10 inches thick or as many thin horizons (1 to 2 inches) separated by thin layers of soil material.  Most areas have a thin laminar cap."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: La Palma soils are on nearly level to gently sloping relict basin floors and fan terraces.  These soils formed in a thin layer of eolian loams and mixed alluvium from acid igneous rocks.  Elevations are 400 to 2000 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent, but are usually less than 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 10 inches.  The average annual temperature is 67 to 75 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 240 to 325 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Type location is being moved back to where series was first established. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized are:\nPetrocalcic horizon - The hard, nonporous lime cemented pan at about 28 inches.\nArgillic horizon - The zone of clay enrichment from about 3 to 18 inches.\nCalcic horizon - Some pedons have sufficient accumulations of secondary carbonates, others do not.  Because of the presence of a petrocalcic horizon the calcic horizon is not used as series differentia.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
