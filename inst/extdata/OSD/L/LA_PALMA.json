  "OVERVIEW": "The La Palma series consists of moderately deep, well drained saline (sodic) soils on relict basin floors and fan terraces.  These soils formed in eolian material and mixed alluvium.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 70 degrees F.",

May and June are the driest months. Typic aridic moisture regime.\nRock fragments - Averages less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section.\nDepth to petrocalcic - Dominantly 24 to 34 inches but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nSAR - 13 to 100 or more throughout.\nSalinity - Slightly saline to moderately saline; EC - 4 to 16 dS/m or more.\nRelict water table - In some pedons there is evidence of a relict perched water table in the B horizon.  Therefore, high and low chroma mottles are allowed in this horizon.\nA horizon\nHue: 10YR or 7.5YR\nValue: 5, 6 or 7 dry, 3, 4 or 5 moist\nChroma: 3 or 4 dry, 3, 4 or 6 moist\nTexture: Very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam\nOrganic matter: Less than 1 percent\nCarbonates:  Disseminated.\nBt horizon\nHue: 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 5, 6 or 7 dry, 4, 5 or 6 moist\nChroma: 3 or 4 dry, 3, 4 or 6 moist\nTexture: Very fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam\nStructure: Usually blocky but is columnar or prismatic in some pedons.\nBk horizon\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 5, 6, 7 or 8 dry, 5, 6 or 7 moist\nChroma: 2 or 3 dry, 3 or 4 moist\nTexture: Clay loam, loam\nCarbonates: Occur as soft lime masses and as nodules; calcium carbonate equivalent is 5 to 25 percent.  The horizon immediately above the petrocalcic horizon is calcic where it is thick enough.\nBm horizon\nThis lime-cemented pan occurs in two ways.  As a single horizon 4 to 10 inches thick or as many thin horizons (1 to 2 inches) separated by thin layers of soil material.  Most areas have a thin laminar cap."

These soils formed in a thin layer of eolian loams and mixed alluvium from acid igneous rocks.  Elevations are 400 to 2000 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent, but are usually less than 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 10 inches.  The average annual temperature is 67 to 75 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 240 to 325 days."

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized are:\nPetrocalcic horizon - The hard, nonporous lime cemented pan at about 28 inches.\nArgillic horizon - The zone of clay enrichment from about 3 to 18 inches.\nCalcic horizon - Some pedons have sufficient accumulations of secondary carbonates, others do not.  Because of the presence of a petrocalcic horizon the calcic horizon is not used as series differentia.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999"
