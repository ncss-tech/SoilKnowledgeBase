  "OVERVIEW": "The Long Hollow series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in organic deposits within glacial moraines. The Long Hollow series is typically recognized as calcareous fens. Slopes range from 1 to more than 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 645 millimeters (25 inches) and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C (43 degrees F).",
