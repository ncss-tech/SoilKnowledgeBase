    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Prior to 1939, the Leonardtown series included moderately well drained soils that are now correlated to the Beltsville series, and somewhat poorly drained soils that are now correlated to the Aquasco series.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 5 cm (0 to 2 inches) (Ag horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 5 to 109 cm (2 to 43 inches) (Btg horizons)\nFragipan--the zone from 56 to 109 cm (22 to 43 inches) (Btgx horizon)\nAquic conditions--redoximorphic features occur in all horizons below the mineral soil surface, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year\nOther soil features identified with this pedon:\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 150 cm (0 to 59 inches)\nPrevious revisions: 03/2006-WDC, 08/2006-WDC/Rev. DRPV\nThe 2007 revision moves the Typical Pedon. The previous Typical Pedon was imprecisely located and could not be found for study. It also changes the CE activity Class from semiactive to active based on the classification of similar soils in the region.\nADDITIONAL DATA: This pedon sampled as S01 MD 033-002.  Additional reference samples S01 MD 033-001, S01 MD 033003.  Analysis of all pedons provided by the University of Maryland soil lab.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
