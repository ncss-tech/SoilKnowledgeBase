  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Major diagnostic horizons and other soil characteristics recognized in the profile are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon -- 0 to 13 cm (A)\n1.1 Colors have too high of value and are not thick enough for mollic epipedon\n1.2 Organic carbon assumed less than 0.6 percent.\n2.  Argillic horizon -- 13 to 66 cm (Btk and BCtk)\n2.1 Clay increases from 8 percent (A) to 13 percent (Btk) by field estimate.\n2.2 Clay films observed\nOther Soil Characteristics:\n1.  Xeric subgroup\n1.1 Soil moisture control section is dry less than three fourths time that the soil temperature at 51 cm is above 5 degrees C.  (Based on SCS moisture/temperature transect data).\n2. Thermic soil temperature regime -- assumption based on preliminary SCS soil temperature transect, 55 years local climatic records and BLM data.\n3. Mineralogy - assumed mixed; no indication otherwise.\n4. Loamy-skeletal family -- The control section averages 11 percent clay and more than 35 percent rock fragments determined by field estimates and sieving.\n5.  Carbonates -- The Btk, BCtk and BCk horizons have disseminated and/or segregated carbonates.\n6.  Moisture regime - aridic moisture regime bordering on xeric.\n6.1 The MCS is dry throughout from May 15 to December 1.  It is moist throughout from January 1 to April 1.\n6.2  The soil temperature exceeds 5 degrees C from February 15 to December 15 (300 days).  Within this time period, the MCS is dry from May 15 to December 1 (200 days).\n6.3 The soil temperature exceeds 8.3 degrees C. from March 1 to November 15 (260 days).  Within this time period, the MCS is dry from May 15 to November 15 (185 days)."
