  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness exceeds 60 inches. Combined thickness of the A and B horizons containing less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand commonly is about 35 inches, and is everywhere less than 48 inches.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid in each horizon, except where lime has been added.  Base saturation 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon ranges from 36 percent to 59 percent, but is commonly less than 40 percent.\nThe Ap horizon or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Some pedons have a thin (less than 6 inches) A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam. In severely eroded areas texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma 3 to 6.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Clay content commonly is 20 to 30 percent, but ranges from 18 to 35 percent.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon commonly contains 5 to 10 percent fine and coarser sand.   The amount of sand gradually increases with depth.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8. Texture is sandy loam, silt loam, loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Most pedons have few to many brownish or yellowish pockets of sand or loamy sand.\nThe 2E and Bt horizon is not a requirement for the series.  Where present, the E material has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is sand or loamy sand. The Bt material consists of thin lamella of sandy loam commonly in shades of brown."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Armour, Barnsdall, Dexter, Dossman, Feliciana, Goodwill, and Hicks series.  Armour soils formed in limestone residuum, valley fill, and alluvium and do not have a significant increase in sand content in the lower subsoil.  Barnsdall soils have redder colors and are on flood plains.  Dexter soils have a thinner solum and are on stream terraces.  Dossman soils formed in deep loess and have less sand in the particle size control section.  Goodwill soils have yellower colors in the Bt horizon and are on low stream terraces.  Hicks soils formed in a silty mantle over siltstone residuum and have a Cr horizon between 40 and 60 inches.  Feliciana soils formed in deep loess and have less sand in the solum."

Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Near the type location the average annual precipitation is about 51 inches. Average annual temperature is about 60 degrees F."

Memphis soils are on broader ridgetops and have less sand in the solum.  Deanburg soils are fine-loamy and on stream terraces.  Providence soils have a fragipan in the subsoil.  Smithdale soils are fine-loamy and are on adjacent steeper side slopes.  Collins, Iuka, and Vicksburg soils are coarse-silty and are on flood plains."
