Redoximorphic features consisting of concentrations of Fe/Mn oxides, Fe or clay depletions, or reduced matrices occur within 20 inches of the soil surface. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent by volume in the surface layer, and from 10 to 35 percent by volume in the subsoil and substratum. Unless limed, reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum, and moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is loam or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 2. It has faint to prominent redox accumulations or depletions. Texture is loam or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky or platy. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 0 through 2. It has distinct or prominent redox concentrations or depletions. Texture is loam or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky. Consistence is friable.\nThe BCg horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 0 through 6, although dominantly 0 through 3 chroma. They may have faint to prominent redox concentrations or depletions. Texture is loam or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate prismatic, platy or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 through 4. They have faint to prominent redox concentrations or depletions. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate platy or it is massive.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.\nThe Breckenridge, Burnham, Cable, Cabot, Lahrity and Tonkey series are in related families. Breckenridge soils have less than 5 percent rock fragments throughout the soil and higher clay content in the substratum. Burnham soils have a histic epipedon, and a Cd horizon in dense basal till substrata. Cable soils have light colored Ochric epipedons and less moisture in the subsoil during the growing season. Cabot soils are shalloe and have a Cd within 20 inches. Lahrity soils have less effective precipitation during the growing season and have more rock fragments in the substratum. Tonkey soils have a stratified substratum dominated by sand and gravel."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Lyonmounten soils are nearly level and gently sloping soils on till uplands. They occur in depressions and on smooth till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent, but is dominantly 0 to 2 percent. The till parent material is derived from granite, sandstone and other sedimentary rock. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 38 inches, mean annual air temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F, and mean frost-free season ranges from 90 to 140 days. Elevation ranges from 200 to 1800 feet above sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the well drained Bice, the moderately well drained Schroon, and the somewhat poorly drained Peasleeville soils which are associated in a drainage sequence. Kalurah, Malone, Runeberg, Coveytown, Cook and Adirondack soils are also associated. The moderately well drained Kalurah soils are on convex knolls and ridges. Malone and Runeberg soils have free carbonates higher in the profile and are on similar landscapes. Coveytown and Cook soils have a sandy mantle over loamy till substrata and occur on footslopes and toeslopes of glacial lake beach ridges. Adirondack soils are on similar landscapes but have a dense, slowly permeable substratum."
