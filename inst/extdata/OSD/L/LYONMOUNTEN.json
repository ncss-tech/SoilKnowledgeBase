    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.\nThe Breckenridge, Burnham, Cable, Cabot, Lahrity and Tonkey series are in related families. Breckenridge soils have less than 5 percent rock fragments throughout the soil and higher clay content in the substratum. Burnham soils have a histic epipedon, and a Cd horizon in dense basal till substrata. Cable soils have light colored Ochric epipedons and less moisture in the subsoil during the growing season. Cabot soils are shalloe and have a Cd within 20 inches. Lahrity soils have less effective precipitation during the growing season and have more rock fragments in the substratum. Tonkey soils have a stratified substratum dominated by sand and gravel."

Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent, but is dominantly 0 to 2 percent. The till parent material is derived from granite, sandstone and other sedimentary rock. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 38 inches, mean annual air temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F, and mean frost-free season ranges from 90 to 140 days. Elevation ranges from 200 to 1800 feet above sea level."

Kalurah, Malone, Runeberg, Coveytown, Cook and Adirondack soils are also associated. The moderately well drained Kalurah soils are on convex knolls and ridges. Malone and Runeberg soils have free carbonates higher in the profile and are on similar landscapes. Coveytown and Cook soils have a sandy mantle over loamy till substrata and occur on footslopes and toeslopes of glacial lake beach ridges. Adirondack soils are on similar landscapes but have a dense, slowly permeable substratum."
