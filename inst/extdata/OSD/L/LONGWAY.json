  "OVERVIEW": "The Longway series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium from rhyolitic tuff, rhyolite and quartzite.  Longway soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 580 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.",
