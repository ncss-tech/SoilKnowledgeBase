Soil is usually moist from July through December.\nSoil temperature - 78 to 84 degrees F., with less than 4 degrees F. variation between summer and winter.\nSoil Depth - 4 to 10 inches to a paralithic contact.\nDepth to soft rock - 4 to 10 inches.\nDepth to hard bedrock - 6 to 20 inches.\nClay content - 20 to 35 percent.\nSand content - 25 to 45 percent.\nCoarse fragments - 15 to 35 percent, over half as cobbles, all as limestone.\nA horizon - Color: Dominantly 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4, ranges to 10YR 4/3. Thin A1 horizons of 10YR 2/2, 3/2 are common in forested pedons but generally absent in grassland (cultivated) pedons. Total thickness: 2 to 15 inches. Wet consistence: Nonsticky to slightly sticky.\nReaction: neutral to mildly alkaline.\nB horizon - Color: Dominantly 7.5YR 4/4, ranges to 4/6 or 5/6. Higher chromas and values are commonly in pedons with thicker B horizons. Texture: Cobbly clay loam, Cobbly loam.\nWet consistence: Nonsticky or slightly sticky.\nOther: The B horizon is intermittent in many pedons, absent in some. Few thin pressure faces are in the lower part of the thicker B horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Luta soils are on uplifted limestone plateaus that were deposited as part of a coral reef complex. These soils formed in residuum from the underlying limestone, and possibly from other sources as well, such as volcanic ash.\nSlopes are 0 to 30 percent. Elevations are 65 to l,575 feet. Mean annual temperature is 77 degrees F., with less than 4 degrees F. difference between summer and winter. Mean annual precipitation is 80 to 100 inches, most of which falls between June and November."
