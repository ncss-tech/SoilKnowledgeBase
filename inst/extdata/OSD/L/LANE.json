  "OVERVIEW": "The Lane series consists of very deep, well drained and moderately well drained soils formed in local clayey alluvium on foot slopes, fans, and stream terraces.  These soils have moderately slow or slow permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual temperature about 49 degrees F.",

Few or common tongues of A horizon material extend into the Btk horizon in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or is silty clay in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is silty clay, but is clay loam, clay, or silty clay loam in some pedons with an estimated 35 to 50 percent clay content.  It is slightly acid or neutral in the upper part and neutral or slightly alkaline in the lower part.\nThe Btk and Bk horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  They are silty clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam and are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Few or common nests or striations of salts and gypsum are in some pedons.  Thin strata of coarser or finer textures are between depths of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons.  Glacial till is between depths of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons.  The C horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Ladysmith soils have thicker sola, have free carbonate at greater depths and occur in areas of greater rainfall.   Rago soils have buried paleosols in the lower part of the series control section.  Smolan soils have redder hues in the lower part of the solum and are leached of carbonate to greater depths."

The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 49 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 22 inches."
