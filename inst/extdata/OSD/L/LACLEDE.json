  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 15 to 35 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 degrees to 47 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is 62 degrees to 68 degrees F.  Coarse fragments are absent in most pedons but may range up to 5 percent.  Carbonates range from 5 to 15 percent clay, 45 to 82 percent silt, and 0 to 20 percent sand with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR; value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist; and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay.  Reaction ranges from mildly to moderately alkaline.  E.C. is 0.5 to 4 mmhos/cm.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR; value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist; and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from mildly to strongly alkaline.  E.C. is 0.5 to 4 mmhos/cm.\nThe C or Cca horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR; value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist; and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from moderately to strongly alkaline.  E.C. is 0.5 to 4 mmhos/cm."

Elevation ranges from 6,000 to 7,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 to 9 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer air temperature is about 61 degrees to 66 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 80 to 110 days."
