In most years, these soils are dry for 90 or more cumulative days in some subhorizon between depths of 4 and 12 inches, but are not dry in all parts for more than half the time that the soil temperature is higher than 41 degrees F. at a depth of 20 inches (See Remarks).  Rock fragments are gravel, cobbles, and stones of granite and quartz.  Carbonates as soft powdery lime occur at depths of 28 to 40 inches.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or clay loam and has 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe B2t horizon has a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is clay loam, sandy clay or clay and has 35 to 50 percent clay and 5 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe C horizon has 40 to 60 percent gravel and 10 to 20 percent cobbles."
