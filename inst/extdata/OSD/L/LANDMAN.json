  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 80 to more than 100 inches.  Thickness of the arenic epipedon ranges from 40 to about 80 inches.  However, it is typically 50 to 75 inches thick.  Siliceous or ironstone pebbles range from none to few throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Some pedons have value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4.  The texture is loamy sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.  The reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Streaks, mottles or small pockets in shade of brown, yellow or gray range from none to common.  Some pedons have thin bands of lamella and/or spots of loamy materials with these colors typically in the lower part.  Dark concretions or nodules range from none to common.  Texture is loamy sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has a mottled matrix of the matrix color is in shades of gray or brown with or without yellowish or reddish mottles.  The texture is mainly sandy clay loam but some pedons have layers of fine sandy loam, clay loam, or sandy clay.  However, the weighted average clay content of the control section ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  Dark concretions or nodules range from none to common.  The reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid, but typically is strongly acid or medium acid."

Kenney soils have B2t horizons with hue redder than 7.5YR.  Latch soils have sola less than 80 inches thick.  Lutterloh soils have a shallower water table.  Pickton soils are on uplands.  Bienville soils have Bt horizons that are loamy fine sand or that consist of lamella.  Boy soils contain more than 5 percent plinthite.  Darco, Gunter, and Shankler soils have base saturation less than 35 percent.  Depcor and Larue soils have sandy epipedons 20 to 40 inches thick."

The soil formed in sandy and loamy alluvium.  The climate is subhumid.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 66 degrees to 69 degrees F, mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 50 inches, and Thornthwaite annual P-E index exceeds 64."
