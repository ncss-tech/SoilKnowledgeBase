  "OVERVIEW": "The Lidan series consists of moderately deep to an indurated hardpan, well drained soils that are on slightly convex erosional fan remnants of fan piedmonts.  They formed in mixed alluvium derived mainly from volcanic tuffs and related rocks.  Slopes are 8 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.",
