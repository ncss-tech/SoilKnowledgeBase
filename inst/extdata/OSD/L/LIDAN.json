These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, mainly from volcanic tuffs and related rocks.  Slopes are 8 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,405 to 1,710 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool moist winters and hot, dry summers with occasional convection storms.  The mean annual precipitation is about 130 to 200 mm.  The mean annual temperature is about 12 to 14 degrees C and the frost-free season is about 160 to 180 days."
