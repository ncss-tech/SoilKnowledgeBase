  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist and are dry in all parts between the depths of 4 and 12 inches about 100 to 115 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches and may include the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  There is typically a 1 to 4 inch weathered zone that meets the requirements for paralithic.  The soil is slightly acid or neutral.  These soils have an increase of 20 percent or more clay between the A and 2Bt horizons.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It has 5 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 25 percent cobbles and stones.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5 moist, 3 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry.  It is typically clay or silty clay, but ranges to silty clay loam in the lower part.  It is 35 to 60 percent clay and averages about 50 percent.  It has 0 to 10 percent rock fragments.  Clay films are distinct and/or prominent."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lasere soils are on wave cut benches and south slopes below the high water mark of pluvial lakes at elevations of 4,500 to 5,000 feet.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and lake sediments over basalt and tuff.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches.  The frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."

The Bullump soils are on adjacent north slopes, are deep to bedrock, have a frigid soil temperature regime, and are loamy-skeletal.  Lorella soils are shallow to bedrock and are clayey-skeletal.  Deter soils are on lower terraces, are deep to bedrock, and lack a abrupt clay increase."

The potential plant community is low sagebrush, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass.  In areas with an A horizon 12 or more inches thick, the potential plant community is mountain big sagebrush and Idaho fescue."
