  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 60 to 72 percent.  When dry, cracks 1/2 to more than 1 inch wide extend from the surface to a depth of more than 12 inches.  Cracks are open from 60 to 90 cumulative days in most years.  Slickensides and wedge shaped peds begin at a depth of 10 to 24 inches.  Undisturbed areas have gilgai relief with microknolls about 4 to 12 inches above the microdepressions.  Distance from the center of the microknoll to the center of the microdepression ranges from 4 to about 15 feet.  Mottles  are considered to be litho-chromic or relic.\nThe A horizon has colors in shades of brown or gray in hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  The texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid but is very strongly acid in more than half the pedon.\nThe Bw horizon has colors in shades of brown or red in hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles with chroma of 2 or less range from few to many and some pedons have a mottled matrix of these colors.  The mottles are considered to be inherited from the parent material and are litho-chromic.  The texture is silty clay or clay. The reaction is very strongly acid but ranges to strongly acid is some part of some pedons.\nThe Bss horizon has colors in shades of brown, yellow, red, or gray with hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8.  It is commonly mottled with these colors or has a mottled martix.  The reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the upper part amd ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the lower part.\nThe C horizon has colors in shades of brown, yellow, or gray.  It is shale or shale and marl with clay texture.  The material is in varigated layers, platy, or weakly bedded. Gypsum crystals and/or calcium carbonate concretions and/or masses range from none to common.  Effervescence is very slight or slight in some pedons.  The reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Closely similar series include the Naclina, Moswell, Raylake, Redco, and Woodtell.  Naclina soils are more acid in the upper 20 inches and are well drained.  Moswell and Woodtell soils have a loamy surface layer and a argillic horizon.  Raylake soils have a fine particle-size control section.  Redco soils are classfied in the Typic subgroup and they are more alklaine in the A horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  LaCerda soils are on broad nearly level to moderately sloping interstream divides and strongly sloping to moderately steep side slopes.  Slopes are mainly less than 5 percent but range up to 20 percent.  These soils formed mainly in the shales of the Cooke Mountain Geologic formation.  Mean annual rainfall ranges from 42 to 52 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 65 degrees to 68 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 235 to 245.  The elevation ranges from 200 to 380 above sea level.  The Thornthwaite annual P-E indices exceed 64."
