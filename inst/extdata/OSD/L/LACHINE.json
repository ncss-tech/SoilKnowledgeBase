  "OVERVIEW": "The Lachine series consists of shallow, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy till underlain by karst limestone on ground moraines and glacial lake benches. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
