These soils have deep wide cracks during dry seasons, usually the summer months.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It commonly is silt loam, but can be loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe upper part of the Btg horizon has color value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Iron masses range from few to common and are red, yellowish red, or strong brown. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay. The lower Btg and upper 2Btg horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Iron masses are common to many red and yellowish red.  Texture commonly is silty clay, but can be clay or silty clay loam.  Reaction is slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe lower part of the 2Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 and 2 with few to common strong brown or yellowish brown iron masses. It is silty clay, silty clay loam, clay, or clay loam and strongly acid to slightly alkaline."

Bucknell and Rinda soils formed in thinner loess and have the maximum clay content within a depth of 18 inches.  Gifford soils have less than 10 percent sand to a depth of more than 30 inches.  Kniffin soils do not have chroma of 2 or less in 60 percent of the mass in some horizon between 10 and 30 inches.  Kilwinning and Pershing soils have less than 10 percent sand throughout the solum.  Rathbun soils do not have surface layers that are 7 inches or more thick and have colors with value and chroma of 3 or less. Shields soils have carbonates within a depth of 60 inches.  Stateline soils have a mean annual soil temperature less than 50 degrees F."

Slopes range from 2 to 14 percent.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 50 to 55 degrees F., mean annual soil temperature ranges from 52 to 575 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 40 inches."

Mexico soils are deeper than 30 inches to the 2B or 2C horizons.  The Adco and Mexico soils are on broader ridgetops.  Armstrong soils have brighter colors in the upper part of the argillic horizon and are downslope."
