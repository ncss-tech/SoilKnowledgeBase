Cassal soils are moderately well drained with distinct redox features at 30 to 45 inches. Eastpine, Egyptcreek, Fredonyer, Midpeak, Mineral, Peahke, and Shalrock soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Shilling soils are greater than 60 inches deep and have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick. Umatilla soils are greater than 60 inches deep."
