  "OVERVIEW": "The Longs series consists of deep, well drained soils with moderate permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt and welded tuff mixed with volcanic ash in the upper part. Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent in mountains. The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
