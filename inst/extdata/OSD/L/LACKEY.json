  "OVERVIEW": "The Lackey series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in colluvium and till weathered from granitic rocks. The Lackey soils are on mountain slopes, moraines, colluvial aprons, and talus slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 800 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
