  "OVERVIEW": "The Little Pole series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from intermediate igneous rocks. Little Pole soils are on mountain slopes and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The soil is usually moist but is dry for more than 60 consecutive days in all parts of the 7 to 20 inch depth. Base saturation is more than 80 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist.\nThe B2 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. Organic matter content is less than 1 percent. This horizon is cobbly sandy clay loam or cobbly loam and has 35 to 50 percent rock fragments.  Structure is weak fine to coarse subangular blocky."

Anatone and Foxol soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder. Brad soils have very cobbly loamy sand control sections. Cedaran soils have gravelly clay loam B2 horizon, overlie tuff, and have only 12 to 16 inches precipitation. Swanner soils lack cambic horizons and have layers of carbonate accumulation. Van Wagoner soils have very cobbly sandy loam control sections. Wallsburg soils have very cobbly clay argillic horizons."
