  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is about 45 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is about 63 degrees F. The soil is usually moist but is dry for more than 60 consecutive days in all parts of the 7 to 20 inch depth. Base saturation is more than 80 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist.\nThe B2 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. Organic matter content is less than 1 percent. This horizon is cobbly sandy clay loam or cobbly loam and has 35 to 50 percent rock fragments.  Structure is weak fine to coarse subangular blocky."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Agassiz, Anatone, Brad, Cedaran, Foxol, Swanner, Van Wagoner and Wallsburg series. Agassiz soils lack cambic horizons and overlie limestone. Anatone and Foxol soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder. Brad soils have very cobbly loamy sand control sections. Cedaran soils have gravelly clay loam B2 horizon, overlie tuff, and have only 12 to 16 inches precipitation. Swanner soils lack cambic horizons and have layers of carbonate accumulation. Van Wagoner soils have very cobbly sandy loam control sections. Wallsburg soils have very cobbly clay argillic horizons."
