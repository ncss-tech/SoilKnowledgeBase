Sola are typically strongly to very strongly acid.\nThe Ap or A1 horizon is 7 to 10 inches thick.  It has 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is commonly loam and ranges to sandy loam.\nThe A2 horizon has 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is commonly loam and ranges to sandy loam.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is typically clay loam to sandy clay loam and sub-horizons range to loam, sandy loam and loamy sand.  The B horizon has 5 to 15 percent coarse fragments mostly shale.  The C horizon typically contains strata of sand, gravelly sand, sandy clay loam, loam and sandy loam high in shale fragments.  It is medium acid to neutral in the upper part and moderately alkaline below 6 to 8 feet."

Argyle, Baltimore and Oneco have redder hue.  Bassett, Blooming, Cadmus, Crocker, Lester and Racine soils lack stratification.  Caleb, Lara and Sunfield soils lack shale fragments.  Dowagiac soils have sand or loamy sand at depths of less than 40 inches.  Dunbridge and Winneshiek soils have bedrock at less than 40 inches.  Longlois soils have more clay in the Bt and has calcareous gravel and sand at the base of the sola.  Mohawk, Neda, Octagan, Razort and Renox soils have less acid and thinner sola. Orwood soils lack coarse fragments.  Waucoma soils have clay or silty clay IIB horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Lydick soils are on nearly level to gently sloping topography.  Slopes are commonly 0 to 6 percent.  The regolith is glacial outwash that is fairly high in shale and low in carbonates.  Summers are hot and winters are cold.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 57 degrees F., and average annual precipitation from 30 to 40 inches."
