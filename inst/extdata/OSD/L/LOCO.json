  "OVERVIEW": "The Loco series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in interbedded gray clayey shale and siltstone of the Permian age.  These soils are on convex\nridgetops of uplands in the Central Rolling Red Prairies.  Slopes\nare dominantly 5 to 8 percent but range from 3 to 8 percent.",

The soil is calcareous and\nmoderately alkaline in all horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and\nchroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, silt loam, or silty clay\nloam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma\nof 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam and the clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent.  Soft bodies of calcium carbonate range from few to many.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma\nof 1 to 4.  The Cr horizon is calcareous clayey shale that is\neasily dug with a spade.  Some pedons have interbedded siltstone."

Acme and Cornick soils lack cambic horizons, are dry for longer periods and are underlain with\ngypsum.  In addition, Cornick soils are less than 10 inches\nthick.  Cordell and Quinlan soils lack a mollic epipedon and have\nBw horizons with hue of 5YR or redder.  In addition, Cordell\nsoils have a lithic contact.  Cottonwood and Darnell soils lack mollic epipedons.  In addition, Darnell soils has siliceous mineralogy.  Ector, Lueders, and Talpa soils have lithic\ncontacts.  In addition, Ector and Lueders soils have\nloamy-skeletal control sections.  Grainola, Owens, and Vernon\nsoils have a fine control section and lack a mollic epipedon.  In addition, Grainola and Vernon soils are more than 20 inches\nthick.  Lenapah and Shidler soils have a lithic contact.  In addition, Lenapah soils have a fine control section.  Lucien\nsoils have a Bw horizon with hue of 7.5YR or redder and are\nneutral to medium acid in reaction."
