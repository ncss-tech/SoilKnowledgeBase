Acme and Cornick soils lack cambic horizons, are dry for longer periods and are underlain with\ngypsum.  In addition, Cornick soils are less than 10 inches\nthick.  Cordell and Quinlan soils lack a mollic epipedon and have\nBw horizons with hue of 5YR or redder.  In addition, Cordell\nsoils have a lithic contact.  Cottonwood and Darnell soils lack mollic epipedons.  In addition, Darnell soils has siliceous mineralogy.  Ector, Lueders, and Talpa soils have lithic\ncontacts.  In addition, Ector and Lueders soils have\nloamy-skeletal control sections.  Grainola, Owens, and Vernon\nsoils have a fine control section and lack a mollic epipedon.  In addition, Grainola and Vernon soils are more than 20 inches\nthick.  Lenapah and Shidler soils have a lithic contact.  In addition, Lenapah soils have a fine control section.  Lucien\nsoils have a Bw horizon with hue of 7.5YR or redder and are\nneutral to medium acid in reaction."
