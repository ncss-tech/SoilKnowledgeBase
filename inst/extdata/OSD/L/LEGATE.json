(Ak and Bk1 horizons)\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 9 to 18 inches. The calcic was judged to begin at 9 inches because of the very large increase in carbonate content at that depth. (Bk2 and Bk3 horizons)\nLithic contact - indurated limestone bedrock at 18 inches. (2R layer)\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 18 inches (Bk2and Bk3 horizons)\nSeries control section - The zone from 0 to 18 inches.\nTaxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Calcium carbonate equivalence was determined using a calcimeter.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
