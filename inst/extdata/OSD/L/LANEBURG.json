  "OVERVIEW": "The Laneburg series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, clayey soils which formed in acid, clayey marine sediments overlying chalk and/or marl.  These soils are on level broad interfluves, with slopes of 0 to 2 percent slopes in MLRA 135B Cretaceous Western Coastal Plain. Mean annual tempertature is 60 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 48 inches.",
