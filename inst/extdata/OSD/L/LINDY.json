  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Lower boundary of solum may rest abruptly on limestone bedrock or grade into bedded limestones with soil occupying the interstices.  Coarse fragments and gravel content range from 0 to 20 percent in the A horizon and 0 to 5 percent in the Bt horizons.  Reaction of the solum varies from slightly acid through mildly alkaline, with acidity decreasing with depth. Mollic colored horizons are too thin for a mollic epipedon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, and 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, and 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, chroma of 3 through 6.  It is clay or clay loam, with clay content ranging from 35 to 60 percent."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include Acove, Bluegrove, Bronte, Fulshear, and Katemcy series in the same family and the similar Bexar, Bonti, Lindale, Rowden and Scullin series.  Acove soils have stony argillic horizons over weakly consolidated sandstone. Bluegrove soils are 20 to 40 inches thick over sandstone bedrock. Bronte and Fulshear soils have sola more than 40 inches thick. Katemcy soils have a lithic content of schist at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Bexar and Scullin soils have a mollic epipedon. Bonti soils are more acid in the argillic horizon and are 20 to 40 inches thick over sandstone bedrock.  Lindale soils have secondary carbonates with 28 inches of the soil surface and lack a lithic contact of limestone.  Rowden soils have a mollic epipedon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lindy soils are on upland plains; surfaces are convex to plane, slope gradients are 0 to 8 percent.  The regolith is loamy and clayey and is over thick beds of strongly cemented or indurated limestone.  The underlying limestone is generally of lower Cretaceous age but some areas are over Pennsylvanian or Permian limestone.  The climate in the area of occurrence is dry subhumid with a mean annual precipitation range of 24 to 34 inches.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices of 34 to 54 and mean annual temperature range of 64 to 65 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  The principal associated soils are the competing Bexar series and Hensley, Leeray, Palopinto, Rowden and Truce series.  Bexar soils are on positions similar to Lindy soils.  Hensley soils have sola less than 20 inches thick. Leeray soils are clayey throughout and have gilgai microrelief. Hensley and Leeray soils are on positions similar to Lindy soils. Palopinto soils have sola less than 20 inches thick and loamy-skeletal control sections and are above along slopes and ridgetops.  Rowden soils occur in similar positions.  Truce soils have sola thicker than 40 inches and are slightly higher in the landscape on convex stream divides or hillsides."
