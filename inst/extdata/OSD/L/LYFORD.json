Salinity ranges from 0.1 to 4.0 mmhos/cm and increases\nwith depth.\nThe A and B21t horizons are dark grayish brown to gray or very\ndark grayish brown in a hue of 10YR, with values of 3 and 4 and chromas of 1 or 2.  The B21t horizon has few to common, faint to distinct grayish and brownish mottles.  The A horizon is sandy\nclay loam or loam and is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B22t and B3 horizons are grayish brown or light gray to light yellowish brown in hues of 7.5YR and 10YR, with values of 5 or 6\nand chromas of 2 through 4.  The Bt horizon is sandy clay loam or clay loam wih a clay content of 25 to 35 percent and is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon is brownish to grayish in hues of 7.5YR to 10YR,\nwith values of 6 or 7 and chromas of 2 through 4."
