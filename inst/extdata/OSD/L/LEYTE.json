  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Leyte series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from granodiorite, quartzite and porphyritic rhyolite. Leyte soils are on pediments, hills and mountains.  Slope ranges from 3 to 55 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.",
