  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 0 to 12 inches.  The soil commonly is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline, but a few pedons are strongly alkaline.  Depth to sandy material ranges from 20 to 40 inches.   A saline phase is recognized.\nThe A horizon has color value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is dominant loam or clay loam, but the range includes silty clay loam.\nThe AC horizon has value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is clay loam or loam.  A few pedons have strata of sandy clay loam or silty clay loam.  Pedons with 3 chroma have mottles with 2 chroma above depths of 40 inches.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, sand, or coarse sand.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent by volume.  A few pedons have buried dark colored horizons below 40 inches."

Kaski, Waldeck, and Zenda soils have contrasting textures at a depth greater than 40 inches.  These soils are on similar positions as Lesho soils. The somewhat excessively drained Lincoln soils  have contrasting textures at a depth greater than 40 inches and are lower on the flood plains."
