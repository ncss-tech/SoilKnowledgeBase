  "REVDATE": "10/2000",
  "STATES": "KS,OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lesho series consists of very deep somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly over rapidly permeable soils. They are formed in loamy sediments moderately deep over sandy alluvium.  These soils are on low stream terraces or flood plains and have slopes ranging from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 24 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 0 to 12 inches.  The soil commonly is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline, but a few pedons are strongly alkaline.  Depth to sandy material ranges from 20 to 40 inches.   A saline phase is recognized.\nThe A horizon has color value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is dominant loam or clay loam, but the range includes silty clay loam.\nThe AC horizon has value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is clay loam or loam.  A few pedons have strata of sandy clay loam or silty clay loam.  Pedons with 3 chroma have mottles with 2 chroma above depths of 40 inches.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, sand, or coarse sand.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent by volume.  A few pedons have buried dark colored horizons below 40 inches."

Kaski, Waldeck, and Zenda soils have contrasting textures at a depth greater than 40 inches.  These soils are on similar positions as Lesho soils. The somewhat excessively drained Lincoln soils  have contrasting textures at a depth greater than 40 inches and are lower on the flood plains."
