  "REVDATE": "2/98",
  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Linder series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in glacial outwash consisting of a 24 to 40 inch loamy mantle over sandy and gravelly sediments on outwash plains, till plains and stream terraces. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy mantle and very rapid in the substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the loamy mantle and depth to free carbonates is 24 to 40 inches. The A and B horizons typically range from slightly acid to slightly alkaline, but pedons that are moderately acid in the A horizon are not excluded.\nThe rock fragment content by volume ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the loamy mantle and 5 to 30 percent in the substratum.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Within 6 inches of the base of the mollic epipedon, hue of 10YR with chroma of 3 accompanied by low chroma mottles are in some pedons. The Bw horizon is sandy loam; but in some pedons a BC horizon of loamy sand or sand with some gravel is present.  The average clay content of the control section above the sand and gravel is 10 to 18 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  The 2C horizon is loamy sand, sand, or coarse sand with 5 to 30 percent gravel, but subhorizons having as much as 50 percent gravel or as little as no gravel are present in some pedons. The 2C horizon is slightly or moderately alkaline and calcareous except for being leached for a few inches in the upper part in some pedons. The sandy and gravelly material ranges from a few to many feet thick. It overlies glacial till or finer-textured alluvium."

Grovecity soils formed in glacial till and have loamy textures in the lower half of the series control section.  Hoopeston and Yahara soils do not have gravel within the control section.   Lawville soils do not have gravel above a depth of 54 inches.  Wesley soils have loamy and silty lacustrine material in the lower third of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Linder soils are on nearly level to gently undulating glacial outwash plains, till plains and stream terraces.  Slopes commonly are nearly plane or slightly convex, but some are slightly concave. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in thin loamy glacial outwash or alluvium which is underlain by calcareous sand and gravel.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 32 inches.  Frost free days range from 145 to 170.  Elevations  above sea level range from 800 to 1500 feet."

Estherville soils and Hanska soils are the most common associates.  The poorly drained Biscay and Hanska soils are on lower-lying terrain. Cylinder soils are on landscapes similar to the Linder soils.  The well drained Dickinson and Wadena soils and somewhat excessively drained Estherville soils are on higher-lying terrain."
