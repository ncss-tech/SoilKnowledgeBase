    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum is 28 to 40 inches thick. The mollic epipedon is 26 to 40 inches thick. The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 64F. These soils are usually dry during the summer and fall months. The A and B horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon has an average clay content of 25 to 35 percent, and 20 to 35 percent coarse fragments by volume. The argillic horizon is 20 to 28 inches thick. The solum is neutral (pH 6.6 to 7.3). The Al horizon has weak or moderate, medium or fine, granular or subangular blocky structure, or is massive. It is primarily gravelly fine sandy loam, but is gravelly loam or gravelly sandy loam in some pedons. Stones on the surface include classes 1 and 2 stoniness. The B2t horizon is primarily gravelly clay loam, but ranges to gravelly sandy clay loam, or gravelly heavy loam. It has weak to strong, medium or coarse subangular blocky structure, depending upon the gravel content. The C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It has slight to violent effervescence and has few to many, fine to coarse lime filaments or coatings on pebbles. This horizon is mildly to moderately alkaline (pH 7.8 to 8.4) ."

The soils formed in gravelly loamy alluvium primarily from rhyodacitic ignimbrites. The climate ig cool, continental. The mean annual temperature is about 40 to 45F., mean summer temperature is 60 to 62F., and the average frost-free season is about 100 days. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 incheg, with most of it coming as snow."

Uomestake soils have clayey-skeletal argillic horizons and weakly cemented Csica horizons.  Satt soils have cryic temperature regime and indurated duripans.
