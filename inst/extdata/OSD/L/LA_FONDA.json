  "OVERVIEW": "The La Fonda series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in medium and moderately fine textured calcareous sediments derived from sandstone and shale.  La Fonda soils are on fan remnants and piedmont slopes.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

Atrac soils do not have visible forms of secondary carbonates in the control section.  Edgar soils have a calcic horizon.  McRae, Querencia, and Zigweid soils have hue yellower than 7.5YR.  La Lande soils have mean annual soil temperature greater than 59 degrees F. (thermic)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The La Fonda soils are on fan remnants and piedmont slopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  They formed in medium and moderately fine textured calcareous sediments derived principally from \"redbed\" formations of Jurassic, Triassic, Permian and Pennsylvanian age.  These formation are mostly shales and fine grained sandstones.  The sediments are readily susceptible to water erosion and areas of La Fonda soils are often cut by arroyos. The climate is semiarid and continental.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches, but does range to 16 inches in some areas with a pronounced summer maximum characterized by frequent heavy thunderstorms of short duration.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 50 to 58 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from 120 to 180 days and elevation ranges from 4,200 to 7,000 feet."
