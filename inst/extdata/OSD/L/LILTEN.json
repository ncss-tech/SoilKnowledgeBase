    "content": "REMARKS:  These were formerly mapped as Rockland in the unpublished report, Soil Survey of Western Fresno, 1967.  They are being differentiated by being classified and mapped.  The pH is determined by colorimetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Truog Triplex indicators.  Texture determined by hydrometer method.  Presence of lime determined by 10 percent hydrochloric acid.  Organic matter estimated from nearby soil with Walkley-Black digestion method data.\nMAJOR DIAGNOSTIC HORIZONS:\n1.   OCHRIC EPIPEDON--0 to 18 inches\n1.2  Moist value 4\n1.3  Organic matter less than 1 percent.
