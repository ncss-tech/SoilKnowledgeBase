The pH is determined by colorimetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Truog Triplex indicators.  Texture determined by hydrometer method.  Presence of lime determined by 10 percent hydrochloric acid.  Organic matter estimated from nearby soil with Walkley-Black digestion method data.\nMAJOR DIAGNOSTIC HORIZONS:\n1.   OCHRIC EPIPEDON--0 to 18 inches\n1.2  Moist value 4\n1.3  Organic matter less than 1 percent.
