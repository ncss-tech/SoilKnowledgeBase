  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Leland soils are on low lake terraces.  These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sedimentary rocks such as sandstone and limestone and metamorphic rocks such as quartzite.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 65 to 72 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 120 to 165 days."

Saltair soils are fine-silty and have salic horizons.  Syracuse soils are coarse-loamy and have mollic epipedons.  Warm Springs soils have mollic epipedons."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 8 inches (E horizon).\nAlbic horizon - The zone from the soil surface to 8 inches (E horizon).\nNatric horizon - The zone from 8 to 19 inches (Btkn1 and Btkn2 horizons).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 8 to 19 inches (Btkn1 and Btkn2 horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 30 and 48 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the C1, C2, and C3 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 8 to 19 inches (Btkn1 and Btkn2 horizons).\nThe revision of April 2005 updated the taxonomic class from Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Natrustalfs based on the assumed moisture regime being xeric instead of ustic.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 140-141, Table 11 of the Soil Survey of Davis-Weber Area, Utah.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
