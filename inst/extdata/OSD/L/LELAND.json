  "OVERVIEW": "The Leland series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained and moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from sandstone, limestone, quartzite, and shale.  Leland soils are on low lake terraces.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
