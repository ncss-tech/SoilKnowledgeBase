These soils have accumulations of calcium carbonate and calcic horizons at depths of 10 to 24 inches.\nThe A horizon ranges from reddish brown (5YR 5/3, 4/3), brown (7.5YR 5/2, 5/3, 4/2, 4/3), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), through dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2).  The texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Btk1 and Btk2 horizons range from red (2.5YR 5/6, 5/8), light red (2.5YR 6/6, 6/8), light reddish brown (5YR 6/4, reddish brown (5YR 5/4), reddish yellow (5YR 6/6, 6/8) through yellowish red (5YR 5/6, 5/8).  The texture of the Btk1 horizon is silty clay loam.  Content of clay ranges from about 27 to 35 percent.  The Btk2 horizon is silt loam to silty clay loam.\nThe Btk3 horizon ranges from light red (2.5YR 6/6, 6/8), red (2.5YR 5/6, 5/8), reddish yellow (5YR 6/6, 6/8), through yellowish red (5YR 5/6, 5/8)."
