  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Luxor soils are on gently undulating to rolling bedrock-controlled landscapes usually with less than 10 percent slopes.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 59 to 71 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from 4,000 to 5,500 feet.  The soils formed in gravelly sandy loam and gravelly clay loam material derived from rhyolite.  The soils rarely receive additional water from surrounding areas of higher elevation.  The climate is arid to semiarid continental.  At the type location the average annual air temperature is 55 to 61 F. and the average annual rainfall is 8 to 10 inches.  The frost-free period is about 200 to 250 days per year."
