  "OVERVIEW": "The Luxor series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in gravelly material derived mainly from rhyolite and basalt.  Luxor soils are on gently undulating to rolling bedrock-controlled landscapes with slopes of 1 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 59 to 71 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from 4,000 to 5,500 feet.  The soils formed in gravelly sandy loam and gravelly clay loam material derived from rhyolite.  The soils rarely receive additional water from surrounding areas of higher elevation.  The climate is arid to semiarid continental.  At the type location the average annual air temperature is 55 to 61 F. and the average annual rainfall is 8 to 10 inches.  The frost-free period is about 200 to 250 days per year."
