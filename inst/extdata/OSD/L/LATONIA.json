Gravel are none to as much as 10 percent of the volume throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3, or it has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2.  Where the value is less than 3.5, the horizon is less than 6 inches thick.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6, or it has hue of 2.5Y, value of 6, and chroma of 4.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe BA and BE horizons, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8, or it has hue of 2.5Y, value 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.

It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  The Bt horizon has 10 to 16 percent clay and 20 to 35 percent silt.\nThe C horizon is variable in color and ranges from white to yellowish brown.  It is loamy sand or sand."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Bassfield and Rumford series and the closely related Benndale, Brogdon, Cahaba, Johns, Kalmia, Kenansville, and McLaurin series.  Bassfield soils have a Bt horizon in hue of 5YR to 2.5YR.  Rumford soils typically have hue of 5YR or redder and have less silt in the Bt horizon.  Benndale, Brogdon, and McLaurin soils have a solum thicker than 60 inches.  Cahaba and Kalmia soils have a fine loamy particle size class.  Johns soils have mottles with chroma of 2 or less within 20 inches of the surface.  Kenansville soils have an arenic epipedon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Latonia soils are on nearly level to sloping marine or streams terraces of the Southern Coastal Plain and Eastern Gulf Coast Flatwoods.  They formed in marine or alluvial sediments that are loamy in the upper part and sandy in the lower part.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The climate is warm and humid.  Near the type location the average annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is about 48 inches."

Well drained Bassfield and Cahaba soils are in similar portions as the Latonia soils.  Well drained Benndale and McLaurin soils are in adjacent uplands.  Poorly drained Atmore soils and somewhat poorly drained Basin soils, which are in depressions and on broad flats, have plinthite in the B horizon.  Moderately well drained Prentiss soils which are in slightly higher positions on terraces, have a fragipan.  Well drained Ruston soils, which are at higher elevations in the uplands, have a solum more than 60 inches thick."
