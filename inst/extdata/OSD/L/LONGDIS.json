They formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks and influenced by volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,650 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
