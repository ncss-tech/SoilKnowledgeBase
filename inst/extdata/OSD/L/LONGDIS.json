  "OVERVIEW": "The Longdis series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks and influenced by volcanic ash.  Longdis soils are on lake terraces and alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
