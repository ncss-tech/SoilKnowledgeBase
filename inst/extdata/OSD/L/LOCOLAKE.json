  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Locolake soils are on plateaus and hills. They typically occur on summit positions. These soils formed in loess derived from mixed rocks over residuum derived from basalt. These soils occur downwind of a salty playa (Summer Lake) and frequently receive new deposits of loess high in sodium salts. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,660 meters. The climate is arid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Felcher, Diablopeak, and Yankeewell soils. Felcher soils are loamy-skeletal, moderately deep to lithic contacts, have cambic horizons, a mesic temperature regime, and an aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric. Diablopeak soils are clayey and shallow to lithic contacts. Yankeewell soils have an aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric."
