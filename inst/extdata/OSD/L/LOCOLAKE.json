  "OVERVIEW": "The Locolake series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in loess derived from mixed rocks over residuum derived from basalt. Locolake soils are on plateaus and hills. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Locolake soils are on plateaus and hills. They typically occur on summit positions. These soils formed in loess derived from mixed rocks over residuum derived from basalt. These soils occur downwind of a salty playa (Summer Lake) and frequently receive new deposits of loess high in sodium salts. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,660 meters. The climate is arid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

Diablopeak soils are clayey and shallow to lithic contacts. Yankeewell soils have an aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric."
