  "OVERVIEW": "The Lawshe series consists of deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils on uplands.  The soils formed in clayey colluvium and residuum weathered from calcareous shale and thin layers of limestone.  These soils mainly are on long foot slopes and have slopes ranging from 2 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches, but is less than 10 only where thickness of the solum is less than 30 inches.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Rock fragments (dominantly limestone) range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in the Ap horizon and the upper part of the Bw horizon and from 0 to 15 percent in the lower part of the Bw and C horizons.  Some pedons have free carbonates throughout the solum.\nThe Ap and AB horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 1 to 3.  The Ap horizon is silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay; and the AB horizon is silty clay or clay.  Flaggy analogs of these textures are permitted.  The Ap and AB horizons are neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; chroma of 2 to 6; and low chroma mottles within a depth of 16 inches (hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, and chroma of 2 or 3 is not common in the upper part).  It commonly is silty clay or clay, but flaggy analogues of these textures are permitted in the upper part.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline in the upper part, and mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the lower part.  Some pedons have a 2Bw horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or 5G; value of 5 or 6; chroma of 1 to 4; and few to many mottles.  It is clay or silty clay.\nBedrock is calcareous soft shale with thin strata of limestone.  It commonly occurs in shades of gray, olive, or green."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Snead is the only other series in the family.  Snead soils have a paralithic contact between depths of 20 to 40 inches and do not have a high proportion of interstratified clay minerals.  Corydon, Fairmount, Gasconade, Millsdale, Otway, Sees, and Woolper series are in related families.  All except Sees and Woolper have bedrock at a depth of 40 inches or less.  Sees soils have a dark surface of insufficient thickness to qualify for a mollic epipedon, have a thicker solum and have an argillic horizon.  Woolper soils have a thicker solum and have an argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lawshe soils are on gently sloping to steep uplands.  They are on long foot slopes that have a plane or concave surface and are below steep areas with hard limestone bedrock.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in clayey colluvium and residuum weathered from interbedded calcareous Ordovician shale and some thin layers of limestone.  Seep spots occur in some places, often at the head of drainageways.  Average annual precipitation is about 40 to 45 inches, and average annual temperature is about 53 to 55 degrees F."

Aaron, Bratton, and Nicholson soils are on broad summits.  Brushcreek soils are on similar landscapes, and in some places are in a complex with Lawshe soils.  Eden and Faywood soils are on steeper side slopes, shoulders, or narrow ridge crests and are moderately deep to shale and limestone.  Opequon soils are on sloping to steep side slopes above Lawshe soils and are shallow to limestone."
