  "OVERVIEW": "The Lorenzo series consists of well drained soils formed in loamy outwash over calcareous sand and gravel. They are on outwash plains, stream terraces, kames, eskers, valley trains, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F).",

The series control section ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the upper part and from neutral to moderately alkaline in the lower part.\nThe A, Ap, or AB horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bt, 2Bt, or 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, and less commonly 5YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 to 6. It is commonly clay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam, or their gravelly analogs. Clay content ranges from 20 to 35 percent. Rock fragment content averages between 2 and 15 percent, but some pedons contain as much as 35 percent.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is gravelly sand, gravelly loamy sand, gravelly coarse sand, or gravelly loamy coarse sand, or the very or extremely gravelly analogs of these textures. Clay content ranges from 1 to 5 percent. Rock fragment content averages between 20 and 85 percent."
