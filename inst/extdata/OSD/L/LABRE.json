Bitton soils formed in alluvium on fans, foot slopes, and terraces, and typically have very gravelly loam profiles. Cabba soils are on uplands and have a paralithic contact at depths of 25 to 51 cm. Doney soils are on uplands and are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Lamedeer soils are on fans, foot slopes, and uplands. They have an O horizon and do not have a mollic epipedon. Ringling soils are on uplands and have fractured bedrock at depths of 13 to 51 cm. Shambo soils are on fans and terraces and have solums with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y. Twin Creek soils are on fans, terraces, and foot slopes and contain less than 5 percent coarse fragments."
