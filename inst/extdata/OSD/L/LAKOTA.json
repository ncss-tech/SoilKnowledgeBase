    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lakota soils are on level to strongly sloping terraces and uplands.  They are in swales and on flats and have slope gradients ranging from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in alkaline alluvium or residuum weathered from soft sandstone.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 17 inches.  Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer."

Daglum and Rhoades soils are fine.  Desart, Ekalaka and Evridge soils do not have visible gypsum or salt crystals within depths of 16 inches.  Flasher, Parshall, Telfer and Vebar soils do not have natric horizons."
