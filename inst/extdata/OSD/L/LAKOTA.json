  "OVERVIEW": "The Lakota series consists of deep and very deep, well drained, slowly permeable, sodic soils formed in alkaline alluvium and residuum weathered from soft sandstone.  These soils are on terraces and uplands and have slopes ranging from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.",
