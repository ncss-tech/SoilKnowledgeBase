  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Livengood soils occupy hills and ridges at elevations of 600 to 1,200 feet in interior Alaska.  Gradients range from nearly level on narrow ridge tops to 45 percent on steep hillsides.   They are formed in calcareous loess that overlies shattered bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  The climate is cold continental, with long cold winters and short warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches, with a summer precipitation maximum.  The average December and January temperature is about -10 degrees F., and the average July temperature is about 60 degrees F.  The mean annual air temperature is 22 degrees to 24 degrees F.  The frost-free season probably is about 75 days, but daylight is continuous most of the summer."
