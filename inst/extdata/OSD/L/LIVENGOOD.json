  "OVERVIEW": "The Livengood series consists  of moderately deep well-drained soils formed in calcareous loess weathered shale and graywacke.  The soils occur on uplands, and have slopes ranging from less than 3 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is 22 degrees to 24 degrees F.",

The A1 horizon ranges in thickness from less than 1 to 3 inches, and in color from 7.5YR 4/2 to 10YR 4/3.  The A2 horizon may be absent.  It ranges in color from 7.5YR 5/4 to 10YR 5/3.  The B horizons range in thickness from 7 to 12 inches, and in color from 2.5Y 4/4 to 10YR 4/4 and 10YR 4/3.  The C horizons may be weakly to strongly calcareous.  Rock fragments in the IIC horizon may have carbonate coatings on their undersides."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Livengood soils occupy hills and ridges at elevations of 600 to 1,200 feet in interior Alaska.  Gradients range from nearly level on narrow ridge tops to 45 percent on steep hillsides.   They are formed in calcareous loess that overlies shattered bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  The climate is cold continental, with long cold winters and short warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches, with a summer precipitation maximum.  The average December and January temperature is about -10 degrees F., and the average July temperature is about 60 degrees F.  The mean annual air temperature is 22 degrees to 24 degrees F.  The frost-free season probably is about 75 days, but daylight is continuous most of the summer."
