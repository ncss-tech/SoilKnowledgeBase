The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to  47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 40 to 60 percent rock fragments and 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 30 to 45 percent channers and 5 to 10 percent flagstones.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or clay loam.  It has 20 to 35 percent clay.  It has 40 to 70 percent channers and 0 to 10 percent flagstones."

Blinn soils are dominated by basalt stones.  Daxty soils have 5 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Farva soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Segundo soils have less than 20 percent clay in the control section and are more than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Thout soils have andesite or basalt gravel and have hue of 10YR through 5Y in the subsoil."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lostbasin soils are on south-facing side slopes of hills.  Elevations range from 4,000 to 5,300 feet.  Slopes are 12 to 80 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium derived dominantly from schist and graywake.  The climate is characterized by cold moist winters and warm dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
