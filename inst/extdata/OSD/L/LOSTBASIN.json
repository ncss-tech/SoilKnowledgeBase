  "OVERVIEW": "The Lostbasin series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on hills.  They formed in colluvium derived dominantly from schist and graywacke.  Slopes are 12 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to  47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 40 to 60 percent rock fragments and 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 30 to 45 percent channers and 5 to 10 percent flagstones.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or clay loam.
