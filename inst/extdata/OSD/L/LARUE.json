  "REVDATE": "03/2003",
  "STATES": "LA,OK,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Larue series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in thick sandy and loamy sediments. These soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping uplands and high stream terraces.  Slope is dominantly 3 to 8 percent but ranges from 0 to 12 percent.",

The E horizon is brown (7.5YR 4/4, 5/4), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), or light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) or very pale brown (10YR 7/4).  The A horizon is loamy fine sand\nor fine sand throughout and is slightly or strongly acid.\nThe Bt1 and Bt2 horizons are red (2.5YR 4/6, 5/6), yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 4/8, 5/6), or strong brown (7.5YR 5/6).  The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon is sandy clay loam with the average clay content ranging from 20 to 30 percent.  The lower Bt horizons are red (2.5YR 4/6, 5/6, 5/8), yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 4/8, 5/6, 5/8), reddish yellow (5YR 6/6, 6/8), or strong brown (7.5YR 5/6).  The lower B2t horizons contain mottles in shades of red, yellow, and brown. These horizons are loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam with a few pockets of uncoated sand grains in the lower part.  The reaction of the Bt horizon ranges from slightly to strongly acid."

Bienville soils have discontinuous Bt horizons and sandy control sections.  Boy, Kenney, and Pickton soils have sandy epipedons more than 40 inches thick.  Depcor soils contain plinthite in the Bt horizon.  Heatly, Heaton, Nobscot, Silstid, and Styx soils are drier for longer periods of time.  Larton soils contain slightly less clay in the B2t horizons and are commonly on terraces.  Lucy, Rosalie, Trep, and Wagram soils have base saturation of less than 35 percent.  Wolfpen soils are yellower and have gray mottles in the Bt horizon."
