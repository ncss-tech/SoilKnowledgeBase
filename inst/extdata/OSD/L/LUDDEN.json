  "OVERVIEW": "The Ludden series consists of very deep, poorly or very poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium.  These soils are on floodplains of streams and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 18 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to 48 inches in thickness.  The 10- to 40-inch particle size control section is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam averaging between 35 and 60 percent clay.  Some pedons have an O horizon.  Saline phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or less.  It is a clay, silty clay or silty clay loam.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have an Ab horizon.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 2 to 4 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  It is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam.  It is moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have Bkyg, Bzg, Byg, Bss or Bssy horizons.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 2 to 5 and 3 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  It is clay or silty clay.  It is clay loam below 40 inches in some pedons.  It is moderately alkaline."

Ludden soils formed in clay alluvium that was deposited slowly and the organic matter enrichment of the soil kept pace with the rate of deposition.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 23 inches and mean annual air temperature is 36 to 45 degrees F."

La Prairie soils are fine-loamy and are on slightly higher, better drained areas.  Lamoure soils have less clay and more silt.  Ryan soils have a natric horizon."

An apparent seasonal high water table is at a depth of 0.5 foot above the surface to 1.5 feet below the surface at some time during the period of March through July in the poorly drained phase.  It is at a depth of 0.5 foot above the surface to 1.0 foot below the surface at some time during the period of November through July in the very poorly drained phase.
