  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches and commonly corresponds with solum thickness. Coarse fragments, dominantly shale but including varying amounts of sandstone and limestone, range from 0 to 35 percent. Some hard gravel is usually present, but is not conspicuous except locally on the surface.\nThe Ap horizon has hues of 5YR to 10YR, values of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam and gravelly or channery analogues. It has granular or fine subangular blocky structure. Consistence is friable or firm. It has neutral to moderately acid reaction. Undisturbed areas may have an A or an E horizon.\nThe Bt or 2Bt horizons have hues of 10R to 10YR, values of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6, but have hues of 5YR or redder below a depth of 20 inches. Few or common faint mottles of higher chroma than the matrix are allowed in the lower part. Subhorizons of the B horizon are heavy clay loam, heavy silty clay loam, silty clay or clay averaging between 35 and 60 percent clay. Silt coats are present in the upper 3 to 6 inches of the B horizon. Distinct clay coats are present on both the vertical and horizontal faces of peds in the lower part. Structure is moderate or strong fine to coarse angular or subangular blocky to moderate or strong medium prismatic. They are moderately acid to slightly alkaline and the lower part is allowed to be calcareous.\nSome pedons have a thin C or 2C horizon between the B horizon and R horizon. It is similar in color to the B horizon, but has is massive or has weak plate-like divisions. It is neutral to moderately alkaline, and may be calcareous.\nThe Cr or 2Cr is dominantly a shale that is readily cut with a spade. It is usually calcareous.\nSome pedons have an R or 2R horizon that is dominantly shale, but includes sandstone, siltstone, limestone or dolomite. It is extremely hard and difficult to cut with a spade."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Lairdsville soils are nearly level to steep soils on uniform bedrock-controlled landforms. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. The soil formed principally in clayey till or congeliturbate dominated by neutral to alkaline reddish clay-rich shale, but reddish lake deposits are included. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 45 inches; mean annual temperature from 46 degrees to 50 degrees F.; and mean annual growing season from 135 to 180 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This series has a Cr or R horizon between 20 and 40 inches. As originally defined this was an R horizon, but the easily cut with a spade reference makes this a Cr by modern standard. This leaves the series undefined as to whether an R horizon must occur or not. This series competes with others on the basis of having bedrock above 40 inches. Work is required in the MLRA update process to determine the hardness required of the bedrock to compete with the other series.\nIt is likely that this series should be in the mixed mineralogy family and not the illitic. Work is required in the MLRA update process to determine if this is true.\nThis series reclassified to Oxyaquic based on interpretive information on the water table.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - 0 to 12 inches. (Ap)\n2. Argillic horizon - 12 to 30 inches. (2Bt1 and 2Bt2)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
