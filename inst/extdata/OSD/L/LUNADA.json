  "OVERVIEW": "The Lunada series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from calcareous shale. Lunada soils are on steep side slopes and canyon slopes of hills and mountains. Slopes range from 10 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.2 degrees C.",
