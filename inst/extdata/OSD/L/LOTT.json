  "OVERVIEW": "The Lott series consists of very deep to clayey marl, well drained soils that formed in calcareous clayey residuum weathered from chalk, claystone, shale, and siltstone of Cretaceous age. These gently to moderately sloping soils are on ridges on dissected plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 966 mm (38.03 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 19.3 degrees C (66.8 degrees F).",
