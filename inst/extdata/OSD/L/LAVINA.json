  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The Lavina soils are usually dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches but are not dry in all parts above 12 inches for more than half the time soil temperature is warmer than 41 degrees F. at 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 5.5 dry and 3 to 3.5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is clay loam or light clay with percent clay ranging from 35 to 45, and has more than 10 percent more clay than the Ap horizon.  Segregated lime may occur coating sandstone fragments just above the bedrock, and in some pedons there is, beneath the Bt horizon, a Cca horizon that is 4 to 8 inches thick.  There are 0 to 35 percent course fragments throughout the profile."

Also, Amherst soils have Ap horizon value higher than 4.5 dry and occur in areas of 14 to 18 inches rainfall and 40 to 45 degrees F. mean annual air temperature.  Cabezon soils have hues of 7.5YR or redder in the Bt horizon and have 10 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the Bt horizons.  Ryegate soils have sandy clay loam argillic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

They formed in calcareous, fine-loamy, transported materials or residuum of mixed rock sources overlying hard sandstone.  The climate is cool semiarid with mean annual air temperature of 47 to 49 degrees F., a mean summer air temperature of 65 to 70 degrees F., and mean winter air temperature of 20 to 25 degrees F.   Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches."
