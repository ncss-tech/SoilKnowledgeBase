Goodwit soils have a 12 to 40 inch silty mantle and do not have carbonates. Mashek, Newood, and Peavy soil have more sand in the lower part of the profile.   Padwood and Tipler soils have stratified sandy outwash and do not have carbonates.  Reade soils are underlain by bedrock.  Sarwet soils have more coarse fragments and do not have carbonates.  Shoepac soils have 18 to 30 percent clay in the argillic horizon and have layers exhibiting fragic properties."
