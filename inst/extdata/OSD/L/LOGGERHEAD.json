  "OVERVIEW": "The Loggerhead series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy till on ground moraines.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum, moderately slow in the lower part and slow or very slow in the substratum.  Slope ranges from 1 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
