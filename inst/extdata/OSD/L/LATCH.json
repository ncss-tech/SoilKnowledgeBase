  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Kenney, Landman, Lutterloh, Otela, Pickton, and Tonkavar series in the same family, and the Albany, Blanton, Boy, Darco, Leefield, and Rentzel series in closely related families. Boy and Landman soils have an argillic horizon with more than 5 percent plinthite. Kenney soils have an argillic horizon with hue redder than 7.5YR. Lutterloh soils are somewhat poorly drained and are underlain by limestone. Otela soils are moderately slowly to slowly permeable, have thin lamellae in the lower E horizon and have limestone bedrock between 60 and 80 inches. Pickton soils have a solum thicker than 80 inches, and do not have aquic conditions within 30 inches of the surface. Tonkavar soils have a paralithic contact with sandstone between 60 and 80 inches below the surface. Albany, Blanton and Darco soils have base saturation less than 35 percent. Leefield, Lilbert and Rentzel soils have a sandy epipedon that is 20 to 40 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on oblong and low oval mounds less than an acre to about 5 acres in size along stream terraces. They are typically mapped as a part of a soil complex. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed on sandy alluvial terraces of late Pleistocene and Recent Age in the West Coastal Plains. Frost free days range from 230 to 270 days and elevation ranges from 250 to 400 feet above sea level. Mean annual precipitation is 42 to 50 inches. Summer moisture deficit ranges from 4 to 5 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 64 degrees to 66 degrees F. and the Thornthwaite annual P-E indices ranges from 68 to 80."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bienville, Mantachie, Mollville, Raino, Urbo, and Wrightsville series. Bienville soils occupy slightly higher positions, and have a sandy control section. Mantachie soils have a loamy surface layer, and Urbo soils have a clayey surface layer.  Both are on  flood plain positions. Mollville and Wrightsville soils are slightly lower in the landscape and are poorly drained. Mollville soils are commonly intricately intermingled with Latch soils on the landscape. Raino soils occupy similar positions but have a loamy epipedon and a clayey lower subsoil."
