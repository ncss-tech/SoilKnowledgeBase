  "OVERVIEW": "The Lostine series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess and mixed alluvium including loess and volcanic ash. They are on outwash plains, terraces, fans, and swales on loess hills. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm. The mean annual air temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.",
