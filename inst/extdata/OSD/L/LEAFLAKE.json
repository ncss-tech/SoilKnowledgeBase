  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to carbonates ranges from 35 to 72 inches. Thickness of the sandy mantle ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments are typically absent in the upper sediments but range up to 5 percent. In the lower material, rock fragments ranges from 1 to 15 percent of mixed lithology and pebble to cobblestone in size. In some pedons, stone lines at the boundary of the two materials may have more rock fragments. The underlying glacial till ranges from 12 to 18 percent clay and 45 to 70 percent sand.\nThe Ap horizon has hue 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. It is moderately acid to neutral. An A horizon, ranging from 2 to 8 inches thick, is in non-cultivated areas.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a Bt horizon that has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand. These horizons are often characterized by thin lamellae or clay coats and/or clay bridging between the sand grains or gravels.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam, or loam. It has 15 to 28 percent clay and 45 to 65 percent sand. It is strongly acid to neutral l.\nSome pedons have a 2Bk or 2BC horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Some pedons have relict Fe concentrations. It is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam. It is neutral to moderately alkaline."

Andrusia and Haskill soils have sandy textures in the lower third of the control section. Braham and Cutaway soils have more than 18 percent clay in the lower third of the series control section. Captom soils have sola terminated by soft sandstone bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches. DeMontreville and Escanaba soils have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR in the underlying glacial till. Pomroy and Redeye soils have firm consistence and a bulk density of 1.8 to 2.0 g/cc in the underlying glacial till."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Leaflake soils have plane or convex slopes on glacial till plains and moraines. Slope gradients range from 1 to 20 percent. These soils formed in a sandy glacial outwash or sandy eolian mantle and in underlying loamy glacial till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 27 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F. Frost-free period ranges from 90 to 130 days. The elevation ranges from 1,000 to 1,600 feet."
