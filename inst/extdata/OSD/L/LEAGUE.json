    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for growing rice and pasture.  Rice is usually grown on a 1 in 4 year rotation.  Improved pasture is used for bahiagrass production.  Some areas are used for native pasture.  Native grasses are mainly little bluestem, indiangrass, eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, Florida paspalum, big bluestem, brownseed paspalum, knotroot bristlegrass, sedges, and rushes."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included with the Beaumont and Lake Charles series. The classification was changed from Oxyaquic Dystruderts to Oxyaquic Hapluderts during the update of MLRA 150A. This change was due to lab data at the type location and at other locations.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nCambic horizon  15 to 203 cm (6 to 80 in) (Bw, Bss1, Bss2, Bss3, Bssg1, Bssg2).\nVertisol feature - slickensides at a depth of 28 to 80 cm (11 to 80 in) (Bss1, Bss2, Bss3, Bssg1, and Bssg2).  High shrink-swell potential and cracks that are 1 to 3 cm (1/2 to about 1 in) wide at a depth of 30 cm (12 in) or more during dry periods.\nOxyaquic feature - water is perched from the surface to about 15 to 56 cm (6 to 22 in) for 30 days or more during the winter and early spring in most years.  This layer has redoximorphic features but does not have aquic soil conditions or test positive to a,a'-dipyridyl.\nAdditional Comments: These soils have mollic colors but do not make a mollic epipedon due to consistence.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Jefferson County, Texas; NSSL sample S90TX-245-022 and S90TX-245-023 from the type location.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
