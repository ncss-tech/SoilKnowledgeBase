  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Coral, gravel, sand, or clay is at depths below 40 inches in some pedons.  The soil ranges from nonstony to very stony throughout.  Mean annual soil temperature is about 75 degrees F.  Gypsum crystals 1/8 to 3 inches in diameter are usually at depths below 30 inches.  The C horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist or dry and chroma of 1 or 2 when dry.  The C horizon ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  (This needs updating.) These are the Honouliuli, Kaena, Kapuhikani, Kokokahi, Makalapa, Nonopahu, Papaa, and Waihuna series.  Honouliuli soils have 5YR hue throughout, and their clays are dominantly kaolinite.   Kaena soils have mottles throughout.  Kapuhikani soils are less than 40 inches deep over hard rock, lack gypsum crystals, and formed in olivine basalt.  Kokokahi soils have 2.5Y or yellower hue below the A horizon, and the upper 12 inches has chroma of 1 moist or dry.  Makalapa soils are 20 to 40 inches thick over volcanic tuff, and the C horizon is strongly calcareous.  Nonopahu soils have kaolinitic mineralogy and moist value of 4 or more in the upper 12 inches.  Papaa soils lack horizons containing gypsum and formed in basalt residuum modified by alluvium.  Waihuna soils have kaolinitic mineralogy and mean annual soil temperature of less than 71.6 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Lualualei soils are on alluvial fans and talus slopes at elevations of 10 to 125 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  The nonstony types are normally on gently sloping areas whereas the stony types are near drainages or on talus slopes.  These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium.  Mean annual rainfall is 18 to 30 inches and most of the rain occurs during winter.  Mean annual temperature is 75 degrees F., average January temperature is 71 degrees F., and average July temperature is 78 degrees F."
