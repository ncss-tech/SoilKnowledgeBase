  "BYREV": "Rev. BCJ-RAL-TWN",
  "REVDATE": "06/2003",
  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Larpenteur series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils on old stream meanders and natural levees on flood plains.  They formed in medium to moderately fine textured calcareous alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches.",
