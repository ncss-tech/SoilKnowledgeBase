  "OVERVIEW": "The Luray series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in silty lacustrine material or slack water sediments. These soils are on lake plains, terraces, outwash plains, and some local areas on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",

The somewhat poorly drained Fitchville soils, the moderately well drained Glenford soils, and the well drained Mentor soils are on higher landscape positions. The poorly drained Sebring soils are on similar positions as Luray soils but lack a mollic epipedon. Bennington, Canfield, Mahoning, and Rittman soils are on nearby till plains. Bogart, Chili, Conotton, Damascus, Jimtown, and Olmsted soils formed in stratified gravelly and loamy materials. Linwood soils are on similar landscape positions as Luray soils but have organic material overlying loamy mineral deposits."
