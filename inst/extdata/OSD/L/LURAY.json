    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cyclone, Gabriel, Mahalaland, Mahalasville, Ragsdale, and Treaty series. Cyclone, Mahalasville, and Treaty soils have 2B horizons that contain rock fragments. Gabriel soils have a mollic epipedon that is thicker than 46 cm (18 inches). Mahalaland soils have more than 2 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Ragsdale soils formed entirely in loess and lack stratification in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Luray soils are in slight depressions or on level areas on lake plains, terraces, outwash plains, and in small local areas on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in stratified lacustrine material or slack water sediments of Wisconsinan age with dominant textures of silt loam and silty clay loam. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1016 mm (34 to 40 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 54 degrees F)."

The somewhat poorly drained Fitchville soils, the moderately well drained Glenford soils, and the well drained Mentor soils are on higher landscape positions. The poorly drained Sebring soils are on similar positions as Luray soils but lack a mollic epipedon. Bennington, Canfield, Mahoning, and Rittman soils are on nearby till plains. Bogart, Chili, Conotton, Damascus, Jimtown, and Olmsted soils formed in stratified gravelly and loamy materials. Linwood soils are on similar landscape positions as Luray soils but have organic material overlying loamy mineral deposits."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface during periods of high rainfall in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderately slow."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: More than half of the Luray soils are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, wheat, oats, and mixed hay are the principal crops. Some areas are pastured and some are wooded. Native vegetation is swamp grasses and sedges or deciduous swamp forest."
