  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Goshen, Hall, Johnstown, Kinsell, Kuma, Mobridge, Simpatico, and Zepol series.\nGoshen, Hall, Johnstown, and Mobridge soils are in the ustic moisture regime and are more moist in the soil moisture control section in spring and early summer.  (The Lazarus series is in the ustic aridic moisture regime.)  Kinsell soils have secondary carbonates within the control section.  Simatico soils have an ustic moisture regime and are colder.  Kuma soils are more moist in the soil moisture control section in the spring and early summer months and have buried paleosols within 20 inches. Mobridge soils contain visible secondary calcium carbonate in the substratum, occur in the ustic moisture regime, and are more moist in the soil moisture control section in spring and early summer.  Zepol soils contain visible secondary calcium carbonates in the substratum and have small amounts of volcanic ash in the coarse silt and fine sand fraction.\nPotential competitors if a superactive CEA class were assigned are the Hall and Simpatico series. Both Hall and Simpatico soils have a mean annual precipitation of over 16 inches and are in the ustic moisture regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevation ranges from 6,200 to 7,300 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

Witt soils have a calcic horizon and are on beveled summits of fan piedmonts."
