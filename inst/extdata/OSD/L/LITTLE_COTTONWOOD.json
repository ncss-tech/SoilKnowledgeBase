  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Little Cottonwood series consists of shallow, poorly drained soils formed in 25 to 50 centimeters of till over Sioux quartzite bedrock. These soils are on narrow drainageways on moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters.",

Generally the bedrock will not allow the water to pass downward, while in dry periods the soil can become droughty.\nCation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomy versionKeys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006."
