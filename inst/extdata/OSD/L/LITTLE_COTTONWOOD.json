Generally the bedrock will not allow the water to pass downward, while in dry periods the soil can become droughty.\nCation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomy versionKeys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
