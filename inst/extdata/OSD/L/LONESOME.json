  "OVERVIEW": "The Lonesome series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or eolian material over till, glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on till plains, stream terraces and dunes.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
