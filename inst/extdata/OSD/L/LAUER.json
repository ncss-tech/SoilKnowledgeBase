Canal soils are less than 50 inches to the base of the argillic horizon and formed in stratified silty and clayey glaciolacustrine deposits. Lieber soils have brittle horizons, do not have carbonates and formed in loess and an underlying paleosol in till. Taggart soils contain more than 15 percent sand in the lower part of the solum and formed in loess or silty sediments over loamy outwash. Tiro soils are less than 55 inches to the base of the argillic horizon and formed in silty deposits, loamy water-sorted materials, and the underlying loamy, low-lime till."
