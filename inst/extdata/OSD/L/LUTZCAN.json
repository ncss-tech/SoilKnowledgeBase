These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 23 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 210 days."
