  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 9 to 20 inches.  The fine-earth fraction is clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay with a clay content of 35 to 45 percent.  Reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline in the fine-earth fraction and is calcareous in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, values of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Coarse fragments comprise 35 to 80 percent of the solum and consist of limestone fragments mainly less than 3 inches across.  Some pedons contain from 5 to 15 percent limestone fragments from 3 to 10 inches across.  Individual horizons are gravelly, very gravelly or extremely gravelly counterparts of the fine-earth fraction and the amount of fragments increases with depth.\nThe C horizon is a bed of interlocking fragmental limestone or claystone with fractures at various angles.  Size of fragments is typically 2 to 4 inches but ranges from 1/2 inch to 6 inches across."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Similar soils are the Cho, Mereta, Eckrant and Oglesby series.  None of these soils are in a fragmental family.  Cho, Mereta, and Oglesby soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  In addition, Cho and Mereta soils have petrocalcic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lampasas soils are on gently sloping uplands.  Surfaces are typically convex with slopes from 1 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in fragmental limestone (claystone) of the Walnut Formation of the Lower Cretaceous Period.  Mean annual precipitation is 26 to 34 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 64 to 68 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 220 to 240 and elevation ranges from 1000 to 1700 feet above sea level.  Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 44 to 56."

Brackett, Cho and Doss soils contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Krum soils are in lower valley positions.  Nuff soils occur on similar surfaces."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The fragmental limestone or claystone is finely fractured.  Fractures transmit water to lower depths but restrict roots.  It is readily excavated by heavy equipment and used for road and construction fill material.\nAt the present time there is not a clayey-skeletal over fragmental particle-size class in the classification system. If there were, this soil would be in that particle-size class with montmorillonitic mineralogy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - 0 to 13 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
