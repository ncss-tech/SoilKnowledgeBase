  "OVERVIEW": "The Littlepine series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or slope alluvium derived from sandstone.  Littlepine soils are on fan remnants and hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
