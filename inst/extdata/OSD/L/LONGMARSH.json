  "OVERVIEW": "The Longmarsh series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium over sandy and gravelly sediments. The Longmarsh soils are on floodplains on the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain. Permeability is moderate. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual temperature in 55 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches",

In the substratum organic matter is variable and ranges from 1 to 10 percent. Coarse fragments of mixed rounded gravel range from 0 to 15 percent in the A horizon and 0 to 35 percent in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is mucky sandy loam, mucky loam, sandy loam or loam, and may range to include sand, loamy sand, silt loam, and fine sandy loam.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 2. It is commonly loamy sand, fine sandy loam, or coarse sand, but may include sand, loamy coarse sand, or sandy loam, and their gravelly analogues. Iron accumulations and depletions, when present, have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. These horizons are present in a reduced environment despite the high chroma. It is clay loam, loamy sand, or sand. Zones of iron depletion and concentration may be present."

Soils in closely related families are the Corsica, Indiantown, Johnston, Kentuck, Mullica, and Nikwasi series. Indiantown, Johnston, and Nikwasi soils have an umbric epipedon that is greater than 24 inches thick. Johnston is also thermic. Mullica soils do not have an irregular decrease in organic carbon. Nikwasi soils have strongly contrasting particle-size classes in the control section, mixed mineralogy, and are nonacid. Corsica and Kentuck soils have an argillic horizon."
