  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The umbric epipedon ranges from 10 to 22 inches in thickness. Organic matter content in the A horizon ranges from 5 to 18 percent. In the substratum organic matter is variable and ranges from 1 to 10 percent. Coarse fragments of mixed rounded gravel range from 0 to 15 percent in the A horizon and 0 to 35 percent in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is mucky sandy loam, mucky loam, sandy loam or loam, and may range to include sand, loamy sand, silt loam, and fine sandy loam.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 2. It is commonly loamy sand, fine sandy loam, or coarse sand, but may include sand, loamy coarse sand, or sandy loam, and their gravelly analogues. Iron accumulations and depletions, when present, have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. These horizons are present in a reduced environment despite the high chroma. It is clay loam, loamy sand, or sand. Zones of iron depletion and concentration may be present."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other soil series in the coarse-loamy, siliceous, mesic, acid family of Fluvaquentic Humaquepts. Soils in closely related families are the Corsica, Indiantown, Johnston, Kentuck, Mullica, and Nikwasi series. Indiantown, Johnston, and Nikwasi soils have an umbric epipedon that is greater than 24 inches thick. Johnston is also thermic. Mullica soils do not have an irregular decrease in organic carbon. Nikwasi soils have strongly contrasting particle-size classes in the control section, mixed mineralogy, and are nonacid. Corsica and Kentuck soils have an argillic horizon."

Chicone soils have organic materials in the substratum; Puckum soils have sapric materials greater than 51 inches thick; Indiantown soils have an umbric epipedon greater than 24 inches thick; Zekiah soils lack an umbric epipedon. Elkton, Fallsington, Othello and Hurlock soils are poorly drained; and Kentuck soils are very poorly drained. In addition, Kentuck soils have an argillic horizon and finer textures in the particle-size control section. Mullica soils lack an irregular decrease in organic carbon. Ingleside and Downer soils are well drained; Hammonton soils are moderately well drained;"
