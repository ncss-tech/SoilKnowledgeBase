  "STATUS": "Established Series",

  "REVDATE": "07/2010",
  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Legault series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained or somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, and residuum from schist, gneiss, and granitic rocks.  These soils are on mountain slopes, ridges, structural benches, and spurs that commonly have north aspects.  Slopes range from 5 to 80 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 20 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

With the amount of precipitation typical of this series and under its forest vegetation, it is assumed that pedogenesis is adequate to preclude merely an unaltered C horizon."

(A horizon)\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 1 to 14 inches.  (A and E horizons)\nParalithic contact: at 14 inches. (upper boundary of the Cr layer)\nThe 9/2000 revision changes the classification from the mixed mineralogy class to the paramicaceous mineralogy class.  Laboratory data from soils in similar geologic material indicates that mica content in the sand fraction ranges from about 40 to 60 percent (by grain count).\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Series classified according to Tenth Edition, 2006."

Sample No. is S90-CO-019-003 in Clear Creek County\nThe mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010."
