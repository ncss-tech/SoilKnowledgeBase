With the amount of precipitation typical of this series and under its forest vegetation, it is assumed that pedogenesis is adequate to preclude merely an unaltered C horizon."

    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from 1 to 2 inches.  (A horizon)\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 1 to 14 inches.  (A and E horizons)\nParalithic contact: at 14 inches. (upper boundary of the Cr layer)\nThe 9/2000 revision changes the classification from the mixed mineralogy class to the paramicaceous mineralogy class.  Laboratory data from soils in similar geologic material indicates that mica content in the sand fraction ranges from about 40 to 60 percent (by grain count).\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Series classified according to Tenth Edition, 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA: This series was sampled by NSSL (not this typical pedon). Sample No. is S90-CO-019-003 in Clear Creek County\nThe mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
