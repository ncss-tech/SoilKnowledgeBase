  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Lumberton soils are on strath terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. The soils formed in loess and the underlying loamy outwash over residuum weathered from limestone. Limestone is at a depth of 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches), and in places the depth is quite variable within short distances. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 838 to 1016 mm (33 to 40 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 13 degrees C (51 to 55 degrees F)."
