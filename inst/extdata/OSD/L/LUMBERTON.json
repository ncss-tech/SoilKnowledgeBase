  "OVERVIEW": "The Lumberton series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in loess and the underlying loamy outwash over residuum from limestone. These soils are on strath terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
