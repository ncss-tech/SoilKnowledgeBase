The Pararock fragment in the A and Bk horizons are weakly cemented sandstone and can be crushed between the thumb and fingers when moist. Roots do not penetrate the fragments and plant available water is reduced.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section - zone from 25 to 97 cm (10 to 38 in)(Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in). (A horizon)\nCalcic horizon: 15 to 97 cm (6 to 38 in). (Bk1 and Bk2 horizon)\nParalithic contact: The contact with weakly cemented sandstone at 97 cm (38 in). (Cr horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Particle size analysis was performed at the local project office for 5 pedons from MLRA 83C.\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
