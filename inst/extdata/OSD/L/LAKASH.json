  "OVERVIEW": "The Lakash series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic ash.  Lakash soils are on lake plain terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 130 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
