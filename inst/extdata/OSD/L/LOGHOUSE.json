  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Loghouse soils are on fans and terraces of narrow mountain valleys in deep canyons at the higher elevations, usually above 6,000 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in gravelly and stony outwash of igneous material.  The deposits are from 60 inches to 10 feet or more thick.  Annual rainfall is from 22 to 26 inches.  The mean air temperature is about 55 degrees F."
