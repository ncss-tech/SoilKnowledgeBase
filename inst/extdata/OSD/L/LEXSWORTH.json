  "OVERVIEW": "The Lexsworth series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on river valley flood plains.  They formed in 20 to 40 inches of loamy alluvium deposited over coarse sand or gravelly coarse sand.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and very rapid in the substratum.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches at the type location.",
