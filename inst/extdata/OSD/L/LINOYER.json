Kennewick, Pocatello, and Ritzcal soils have visible carbonates within the series control section. Kennewick soils also have a particle size control section with 0 to 18 percent clay and represent a different climate and Land Resource Region (LRR-A and B). Pocatello soils contain biological concentrations (krotovinas). Ritzcal soils are formed in loess and represent LRR-B. Wheeler soils also formed in loess, have visible gypsum within the series control section, and represent LRR-B."

Slopes are 0 to 10 percent. They formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from sandstone and limestone. The climate is semiarid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 200 to 305 mm. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C.  Frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."
