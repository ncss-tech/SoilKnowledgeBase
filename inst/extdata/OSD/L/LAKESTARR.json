  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lakestarr series consists of deep to a densic layer, moderately well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and loess over colluvium weathered from pre-tertiary felsic gneiss and schist and local till. The Lakestarr soils are on mountain backslopes and foothills. Slope ranges from 8 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
