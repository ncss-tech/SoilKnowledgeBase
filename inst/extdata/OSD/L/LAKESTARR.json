    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Lakestarr soils are on backslopes of dissected mountains and foothills. Slope ranges from 3 to 55 percent. The soils formed in volcanic ash and loess over colluvium weathered from pre-tertiary felsic gneiss and schist and local glacial till. Elevations are 2,600 to 3,600 feet. The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."

Keeler soils are fine-loamy with a surface mantle influenced by loess and volcanic ash, do not have densic materials in the lower part, and are on adjacent mountain slopes at higher positions. Kruse soils are fine-loamy, are xeric, and are on convex mountain slopes. Santa soils have a fragipan, are xeric, and are on convex positions of toeslopes."
