    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are dry in all parts of the soil above 12 inches for at least half the time (cumulative) during the periods the soil temperature is about 41 degrees F., and dry for more than 60 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches within the three-month period following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to the duripan ranges from 20 to 30 inches.  Depth to bedrock is over 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam, gravelly loam, cobbly loam, stony loam, or cobbly clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 2 through 4 moist.  It is cobbly clay or clay.  The upper part has moderate medium prismatic to strong or moderate fine and medium blocky structure.  The lower part has weak or moderate structure and is calcareous in some pedons.\nThe 3Bkqm horizon (duripan) is indurated in the upper part and ranges to strongly or weakly cemented in the lower part.  It is massive or platy and more than half the surface has a laminar coating."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lamonta soils are on terraces, pediments, and plateaus at elevations of 2,200 to 3,300 feet in Oregon and up to 4,900 feet in Idaho.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  They formed in old alluvium, residuum, and colluvium of sedimentary origin.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and hot dry summers.  The mean winter temperature is 32 to 36 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 62 to 64 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches.  The frost-free period is 50 to 120 days."
