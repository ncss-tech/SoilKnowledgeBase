Lebo soils are thought to be well drained.  They are not saturated with water at some season or artificially drained.  The name is taken from a town in Coffey County.\nTaxonomic class added to the OSD with the 03/2014 revision. Cation-exchange activity class based on characterization data from the KSSL for User Pedon ID 83KS107001.\nTaxonomic version:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy, twelfth edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
