  "OVERVIEW": "The Lebo series consists of moderately deep to shale, well drained, soils that formed in residuum from shale interbedded with sandstone.  These soils are on interfluves on plains.  Slope ranges from 8 to 40 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 14 degrees C (58 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 91 centimeters (36 inches).",

Lebo soils are thought to be well drained.  They are not saturated with water at some season or artificially drained.  The name is taken from a town in Coffey County.\nTaxonomic class added to the OSD with the 03/2014 revision.
