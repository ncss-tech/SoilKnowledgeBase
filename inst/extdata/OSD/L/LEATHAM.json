  "OVERVIEW": "The Leatham series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium.  The Leatham soils are on very steep, dominantly south and west mountain slopes. Slope ranges from 30 to 50 percent. The mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 degrees to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature at a depth of about 20 inches ranges from 62 degrees to 68 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry for 60 to 75 continuous days in the 4 to 12 inch section in the summer and early autumn.\nThe mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 12 inches thick.  The carbonate equivalent is more than 40 percent in the top 40 inches.  Cation exchange capacity/clay ratio is 0.6 to 0.9.  The control section is silt loam or silty clay loam with more than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry. It has weak thin or moderately thick platy to moderate fine granular structure in the upper part and weak fine subangular blocky structure in the lower part.  This horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline and is 8 to 12 inches thick. A transitional AC horizon usually is present between A and C horizons.\nThe Ck horizon has value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  This horizon has weak fine to moderate subangular blocky structure or is massive.  It ranges from slightly to strongly alkaline and is very strongly calcareous."

They formed in residuum and colluvium from light colored tuff, conglomerate, tuffaceous sandstone, and limestone of the Salt Lake Geologic Formation. These materials contain considerable ash and have high cation exchange capacities. The climate is moist subhumid. Mean annual temperature is 42 degrees to 45 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 62 degrees to 65 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 20 to 24 inches.  The frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."

Wheelon soils lack mollic epipedons."
