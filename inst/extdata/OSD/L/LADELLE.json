  "OVERVIEW": "The LaDelle series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium on terraces and flood plains. Permeability is moderately slow or moderate.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to calcium carbonates ranges from 0 to more than 60 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 17 to 50 inches.  The control section is silt loam, silty clay loam or loam averaging between 25 and 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine and coarser sand.  Buried horizons are below depths of 17 inches in most pedons.  Some pedons have gypsum and other salts below 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or neutral, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or less.  It typically is silt loam or loam, but is silty clay loam in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  In some pedons the lower part of the A horizon has a value of 5 dry.\nBw or ABk horizons are in some pedons.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or less.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam and is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.  Redox features are variable.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline and has few to common fine threads or fine to coarse coats of carbonate.  Some pedons have thin strata of sand, silt, clay loam, or clay below depths of 40 inches."

Slope gradients are less than 2 percent, except along terrace escarpments that range up to 9 percent. They formed in silty alluvial sediments.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 48 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 24 inches.  Growing season is about 105 to 155 days; average growing season precipitation from 14 to 18 inches; and growing degree days are about 2600 to 3300.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 650 to 2350 feet."

Divide soils have calcic horizons within a depth of 16 inches and are on similar landscape positions as the LaDelle soils.  Forman and Peever soils have argillic horizons.  Poinsett soils have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick.  Forman, Peever, and Poinsett soils are on adjacent uplands.  La Prairie soils have a fine-loamy series control section.  La Prairie soils are on similar landscape positions as the LaDelle soils.  Lamoure and Ludden soils have a wetter soil moisture control section.  In addition, Ludden soils have a fine textured particle size control section. Lamoure and Ludden soils are on slightly lower landscape positions than the LaDelle soils."
