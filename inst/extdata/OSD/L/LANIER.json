  "STATES": "IL,OH",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lanier series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in stratified loamy alluvium and are underlain by sandy and gravelly alluvium at a depth of 41 to 76 cm (16 to 30 inches). These soils are on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

Genesee and Ross soils are fine-loamy, and in addition, Genesee soils have an ochric epipedon. Landes soils are coarse-loamy. Rodman soils are on uplands and do not flood."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lanier soils are on nearly level flood plains that are subject to flooding. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in stratified loamy alluvium derived from areas of calcareous drift and deposited over gravel and sand and variable-sized stream cobbles and flagstones which are mostly of local limestone origin. Limestone bedrock is at depths of more than 152 cm (60 inches). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1041 mm (37 to 41 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 13 degrees C (52 to 55 degrees F)."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Stratification and irregular decrease in organic matter required for Fluvaquentic Hapludolls are not readily evident in the horizons described. However, since the soils are on flood plains and are frequently or occasionally flooded, this seems to be the best placement. Laboratory data is not available for this pedon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 41 cm (Ap, A horizons)."
