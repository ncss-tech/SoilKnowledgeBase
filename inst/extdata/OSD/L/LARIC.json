  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The average annual soil temperature at the lithic contact is 47 to 54 degrees F.  These soils are dry in the moisture control section more than half of the time when the soil temperature at the lithic contact is above 40 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 23 to 30 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments by volume.  Organic matter is estimated to range from 1 to 3 percent.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 5 to 12 inches.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nThe B horizon has a value of 3 to 5 dry or moist, and the chroma is 2 or 3, dry or moist.  It is gravelly loam or gravelly clay loam.   It has moderate fine or medium subangular blocky or weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure."

Adinot soils are moderately well drained and contain 30 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Borland soils have less than 5 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section.  Jilson soils lack silica accumulations on the surface of the lithic contact and have a xeric soil moisture regime.  Malinda and Terca soils are 14 to 20 inches to bedrock.  Marlic soils have a lithologic discontinuity and contains more than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  McQuarrie soils have segregated lime accumulations in the lower part of the Bt2 and lack rock fragments in the Bt2 horizon.  Pass Canyon soils lack a silica cap on the surface of the lithic contact.  Shirts soils have a Xeric soil moisture regime."

Elevations are 1800 to 2900 feet.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 12 inches.  These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 69 degrees F., and the average annual temperature is about 48 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 130 to 170 days."
