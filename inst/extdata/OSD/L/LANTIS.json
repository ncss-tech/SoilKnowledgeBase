The mean annual soil temperature is about 66 degrees to 72 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is about 59 degrees to 66 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Gravel ranges from 15 to 35 percent and cobbles from 5 to 10 percent.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist; and chroma of 3 or 4.  The fine earth material is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam, and averages 18 to 35 percent clay.   Gravel ranges from 35 to 60 percent and cobbles from 10 to 25 percent.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR.  It contains weak or moderate amounts of accumulated calcium carbonate that decrease with increase in depth.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 6 to 14 percent.  Gravel ranges from 35 to 50 percent and cobbles from 20 to 30 percent.  This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline."
