The aspect is variable and elevations range from 5,500 to 7,415 feet (1,676 to 2,260 meters). These soils formed in alluvium from mixed igneous and sedimentary rocks. The average annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches (304 to 356 mm).  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F (7 to 11 degrees C). The mean summer temperature is 69 to 70 degrees F (20.6 to 21.1 degrees C). The frost free period is 90 to 110 days."
