  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lastsummer soils are on mountains and hills.  They typically occur on footslope positions.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as andesite with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,400 to 3,150 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm, the mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."

Adamatt soils are ashy-skeletal, shallow to lithic contacts, and have a frigid temperature regime.  Bodiehill soils are ashy-skeletal over loamy-skeletal and have a frigid temperature regime.  Hardshoulder soils are ashy-skeletal and average 60 to 85 percent rock fragments throughout the particle-size control section.  Roughridge soils are ashy-skeletal, have a frigid temperature regime, and have an aridic moisture regime."
