  "OVERVIEW": "The Lastsummer series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  Lastsummer soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as andesite with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,400 to 3,150 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm, the mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
