  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 18 to 36 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent throughout the soil. Reaction ranges dominantly from moderately acid through slightly alkaline throughout the soil. Colors are strongly lithochromic, as indicated by the wide ranges in hues indicated below.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10R through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is moderate or strong, granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Structure is moderate or strong, platy or subangular blocky. In many pedons, primary structure is prismatic. Consistence is friable or firm. A BE horizon, transitional in color and texture, underlies the E horizon in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, or clay in the fine-earth fraction. The clay content ranges from 35 to 60 percent. Structure ranges from fine to coarse, moderate or strong, angular or subangular blocky, within moderate or strong, medium or coarse prisms. Consistence is firm or very firm, plastic and sticky.\nSome pedons have a C horizon 1 to 8 inches thick. It has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture is silty clay or clay. It is massive or has plate like divisions. Consistence is firm or very firm, sticky and plastic. In many pedons, the C horizon is calcareous."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Brockport, Caneadea, Churchville, Odessa, Remsen, and Rhinebeck series are in the same family. Of these, only the Brockport soils are less than 40 inches deep over rock. Brockport soils have hues in the soil that are more yellow than 10YR."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are strongly influenced by reddish shale that underlies them at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The soils developed mainly in a thin mantle of till which may be influenced by lacustrine materials of similar color and texture. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 45 inches, mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 52 degrees F., and mean growing season ranges from 135 to 180 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Lairdsville soils are dryer soils developed in similar material. Riga and Brockport soils are developed in similar, but more yellow and olive material, frequently in complex association. Appleton and Ovid soils are lighter textured, very deep soils."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon- from 0 to 11 inches (Ap horizon).\n2) Albic horizon (included in the Ochric epipedon) - from 8 to 11 inches (E horizon).\n3) Argillic horizon - from 11 to 24 inches (Bt horizon).\n4) Aeric subgroup - Bt horizon 11 to 24 inches having color value and chroma of 3 or more (required in a horizon between the Ap and 30 inches).\n6) Aqualfs- 50 percent redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less on faces of peds and redoximorphic concentrations within peds in the upper 12.5cm of the argillic horizon (Bt horizon- 11 to 24 inches).\nAdditional Data: The typifying pedon was sampled as S61NY-37-5. The reaction indicated on the laboratory data sheet is much more acid than the concept of the series permits. Reactions indicated are based on field determination.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
