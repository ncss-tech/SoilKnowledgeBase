  "OVERVIEW": "The Lavatop series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed tephra and gravelly residuum from Lovejoy basalt.  Lavatop soils are on ridgetops and sideslopes on volcanic Sierra Nevada mountains.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches, (2032 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F, (11 degrees C).",
