Slopes are 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, with most occurring from July through September.  Mean annual air temperature is 64 to 68 degrees F.  Frost free period is 210 to 280 days, and elevation is 3,000 to 5,000 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Cesario, Cheosa, Fizzleflat, Mariscal, and Straddlebug series.  Cesario and Fizzleflat soils do not have a petrocalcic horizon.  They are on gently sloping erosional plains and pediments below Loyplace soils.  Cheosa soils are shallow to very shallow to indurated conglomerate and are higher in the landscape on erosional uplands.  Mariscal soils are very shallow and shallow to limestone bedrock and are on adjacent hills.  Straddlebug soils are very deep, loamy soils that are on lower Holocene-age alluvial flats."
