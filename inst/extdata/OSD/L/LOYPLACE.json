  "OVERVIEW": "The Loyplace series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon.  These well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and residuum derived from the Pen Clay Formation.  They soils are on nearly level to undulating footslopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.",

Cheosa soils are shallow to very shallow to indurated conglomerate and are higher in the landscape on erosional uplands.  Mariscal soils are very shallow and shallow to limestone bedrock and are on adjacent hills.  Straddlebug soils are very deep, loamy soils that are on lower Holocene-age alluvial flats."
