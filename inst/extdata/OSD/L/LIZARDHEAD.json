  "REVDATE": "04/1999",
  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lizardhead series consist of very deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from granogabbro, granodiorite, or rhyolite as sills and dikes in shale of the Mancos formation.  These soils are on summits and backslopes of ridges and mountains.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.   Mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
