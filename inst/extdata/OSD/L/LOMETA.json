The weighted average of the control section is 35 percent or more. Coarse fragments of cobble size range from 0 to 10 percent by volume.  Depth to secondary carbonates is greater than 30 inches.\nThe A horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is neutral or slightly acid, gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam, or extremely gravelly sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 4 to 8.   It is neutral through medium acid.  It is gravelly clay, very gravelly clay or extremely gravelly clay.  The fine earth fraction contains 35 to 60 percent clay.  Base saturation ranges from 75 to 100 percent.\nThe Bk horizon when present, is less than 10 inches thick and is reddish brown, reddish yellow, or yellowish red .  It is slightly acid through moderately alkaline.  It ranges from gravelly clay or extremely gravelly clay to gravelly sandy loam."

Lusk soils lack a lithic contact and have carbonates nearer the surface.  Pebblepoint soils have sola more than 40 inches thick over chert.  Chigley, Pedernales and Travis soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Hilgrave and Hornsby soils have less than 35 percent clay in the fine earth fraction of the Bt horizon.  Riesel soils have sola more than 40 inches over gravelly sediments."

The soil formed in a conglomerate of siliceous pebbles, cobbles and sand that is weakly to strongly cemented with silica like those of the Travis Peak formation.  The source of the clay may not be entirely from the material. Mean annual temperature ranges from 64 degrees to 66 degrees F., mean annual precipitation of 26 to 30 inches and Thornthwaite P-E indices from 42 to 48."
