  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solumn thickness is 40 to 60 inches or more. Depth to bedrock is greater than 5 feet. Depth to fragipan ranges from 18 to 36 inches. Reaction of the soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid except where lime has been added. Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the A, Bt, and Btx horizons, and from 15 to 80 percent in the 2Btx and the 3Bt horizons.\nThe Ap and A horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. The E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture of the A and E horizons is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6. Some pedons have redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, and gray in the lower part just above the fragipan. Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam.\nThe Btx, where present, and 2Btx horizon have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 or 6. Common to many redoximorphic features are in shades of gray, yellow, brown, and red. Texture is variable. The fine-earth fraction is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 3Bt, or 2Cx horizon if present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8, with few to common mottles in shades of gray, yellow, brown, and red. Texture in the fine-earth fraction is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay."

Guthrie soils have dominant chroma of 2 or less between the Ap and the fragipan. Taft soils have redoximorphic depletions in the upper 10 inches of the B horizon."
