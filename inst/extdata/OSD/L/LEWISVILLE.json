  "OVERVIEW": "The Lewisville series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in ancient loamy and clayey calcareous sediments.  These upland soils have slopes of 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (35.98 in.) and the mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (65 degrees F).",
