  "OVERVIEW": "The Lacreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived siltstone.  These soils are on mountain slopes and scarp slopes.  Slopes are 20 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.",
