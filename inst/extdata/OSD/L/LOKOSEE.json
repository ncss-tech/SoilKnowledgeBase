  "OVERVIEW": "The Lokosee series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately permeable soils on low hammocks bordering drainage ways and on broad flats of central and southern peninsular Florida.  They formed in thick deposits of sandy and loamy sediments of marine origin.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 53 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.",

The Bh horizon is either too thin or too discontinuous for this soil to be classified as a Spodosol.  Combined thickness of the horizons above the Btg horizon ranges from 40 to 80 inches but is commonly 40 to 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon, from moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the Bw horizons, and from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the Btg horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3; or it is neutral with value 2 or 3.  Where the value is 3 or less, the A horizon is less than 6 inches thick.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E and E' horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is sand or fine sand.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray and brown range from none to common.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 8, chroma of 4 to 8.  Masses of iron accumulations in shades of brown, yellow, and red range from few to many.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Redoximorphic features in shades of black, brown, yellow, and gray range from few to common.  Bodies of weakly cemented fine sand in the above mentioned shades are present in some pedons.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown, yellow, and green range from none to common.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  In some pedons, this horizon has few fine to coarse streaks and pockets of coarser material.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has hue 10YR to 5Y, value 4 to 8, and chroma 1 or 2.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand."

In addition, EauGallie, Myakka, and Smyrna soils are less than 30 inches in depth to the spodic horizon and Myakka and Smyrna soils do not have argillic horizons.  The very poorly or poorly drained Holopaw and Malabar soils are on similar to lower positions and have higher activity classes.  In addition, Holopaw soils do not have Bw horizons and Malabar soils do not have Bh horizons.  Parkwood soils are on similar positions, have a mollic epipedon, do not have a spodic horizon, and have secondary carbonates in the lower subsoil.  Pineda and Riviera soils are on similar positions, are arenic, and have tongues of overlying horizons extending into the Btg horizon."
