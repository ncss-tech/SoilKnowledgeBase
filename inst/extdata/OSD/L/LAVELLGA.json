  "OVERVIEW": "The Lavellga series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from basalt and sandstone. Lavellga soils are on treads of dissected fan terraces and have moderately rapid permeability. Slopes are 5 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
