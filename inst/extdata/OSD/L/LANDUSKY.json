  "OVERVIEW": "The Landusky series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from igneous rocks.  These soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 25 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
