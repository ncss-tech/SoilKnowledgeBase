  "OVERVIEW": "The Laredo series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous, silty alluvium derived from mixed sources.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils occur on rare flood plains or low Holocene stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 23.3 degrees C (74 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).",
