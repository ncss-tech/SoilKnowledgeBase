Many areas are planted to wheat in the fall and utilized for livestock pasture during the winter months, or during dry years, some areas are cultivated to grain sorghum.  Native vegetation varies according to amount of water available.  It includes western wheatgrass, buffalograss, lakeweed, aster, smartweed, and milkweed.
