  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 7 to 17 inches thick.  Coarse fragment content in the surface horizons of the profile ranges from 0 to 30 percent, with 0 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobble.  Coarse fragment content within the particle size control section ranges from 35 to 70 percent with 25 to 70 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobble.  Texture of the control section is sand or loamy sand.  Depth to skeletal material ranges from 7 to 12 inches.  In many pedons, the horizons have been churned and mixed by treethrow.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nAn A horizon is present in some profiles.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR, value from 3 through 6 moist, and chroma from 1 through 3 moist.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bs horizons have hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR or 2.5YR, value from 2 through 5 moist, and chroma from 2 through 4 moist.  Texture is generally silt loam or sandy loam.  In pedons where the solum extends into the skeletal material, the texture ranges to sand or loamy sand.\nThe 3C horizons have hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR.  Texture is loamy sand or sand.  The lower C horizons have firm, massive structure."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Lutak soils occur on stream terraces.  The soils formed in a thin layer of eolian silt over glaciofluvial deposits.  The climate is humid maritime with the average annual precipitation ranging from 21 to 65 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 43 degrees F.  The frost free season is 90 to 150 days.  The slope gradient commonly is less than 8 percent, but the range is 0 to 10 percent.  Elevation ranges from 50 to 1200 feet."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are:  a spodic horizon from 3 to 8 inches; sandy skeletal material from 8 to 72 inches.  That part of the spodic horizon that meets amorphous requirements does not extend more than 4 inches into the 10 to 40 inch control section.  The particle size of the control section has significant relation to the physical and chemical properties of the soil.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data is available on this soil:  NSSL Numbers 82P3259-3266.  Lab data does not support a spodic horizon, however, morphology of the soil and presence of cracked coatings does.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
