  "OVERVIEW": "The Lutak series consists of shallow to sand and gravel, well drained soils that formed in a thin layer of eolian silt loam over glaciofluvial sediments.  Lutak soils occur on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 41 inches.",

Coarse fragment content in the surface horizons of the profile ranges from 0 to 30 percent, with 0 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobble.  Coarse fragment content within the particle size control section ranges from 35 to 70 percent with 25 to 70 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobble.  Texture of the control section is sand or loamy sand.  Depth to skeletal material ranges from 7 to 12 inches.  In many pedons, the horizons have been churned and mixed by treethrow.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nAn A horizon is present in some profiles.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR, value from 3 through 6 moist, and chroma from 1 through 3 moist.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bs horizons have hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR or 2.5YR, value from 2 through 5 moist, and chroma from 2 through 4 moist.  Texture is generally silt loam or sandy loam.  In pedons where the solum extends into the skeletal material, the texture ranges to sand or loamy sand.\nThe 3C horizons have hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR.  Texture is loamy sand or sand.  The lower C horizons have firm, massive structure."
