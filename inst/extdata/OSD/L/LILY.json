  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to sandstone range from 20 to 40 inches. Coarse fragments, mostly sandstone channers, range from 0 to 30 percent to a depth of about 24 inches and from 0 to 35 percent below 24 inches. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe Ap and E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Some pedons have an A horizon up to 4 inches thick with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe AB, BA, or BE horizon (where present) is 3 to 10 inches thick, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 8. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam. Subhorizons of fine sandy loam are in the lower part of some pedons. Lithochromic mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow become more common with depth.\nThe BC or C horizon (where present) is 5 to 15 inches thick, has hue of 10YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe R horizon is hard sandstone bedrock."

The Alonzville, Bailegap, Hambrook, Jefferson, Keener, Lonewood, Marr, Raftville, Riney, Sassafras and Sunnyside soils are deeper than 40 inches to hard bedrock. The Harmiller and McCamy soils formed in residuum affected by soil creep in the upper part that weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks such as arkose, arkosic sandstone, quartzite, graywacke, metasiltstone or metasandstone."
