The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The upper 14 to 20 inches of the solum has 40 to 60 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregate and 15-bar moisture of 8 to 12 percent (air dried).  The upper 7 to 14 inches has a phosphate retention of 25 to 35 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 50 percent clay and 20 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 15 to 30 percent gravel.  The moist bulk density is 0.90 to 1.00 g/cc.  Organic matter is 4 to 6 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Littlefawn soils are on gently sloping to steep north-facing side slopes of mountains.  Elevations range from 2200 to 3800 feet. Slopes are 2 to 55 percent.  The soil formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rock with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  The climate is characterized by cool and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."
