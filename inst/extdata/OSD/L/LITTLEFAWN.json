  "OVERVIEW": "The Littlefawn series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on mountains.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rock with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  Slopes are 2 to 55 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The particle-size control section has 35 to 50 percent clay and 20 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 15 to 30 percent gravel.  The moist bulk density is 0.90 to 1.00 g/cc.  Organic matter is 4 to 6 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.
