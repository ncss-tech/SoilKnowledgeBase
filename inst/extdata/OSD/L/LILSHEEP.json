  "OVERVIEW": "The Lilsheep series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium and colluvium.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, hills and relict stream terraces.  Slopes are 4 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees.",
