The mean summer soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. and the mean winter soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist and have a surplus of available water on a monthly basis throughout the year; perudic moisture regime.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to greater than 60 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 30 inches thick.  The solum has andic soil properties throughout, and 35 to 85 percent rock fragments by volume.  The andic soil material has an estimated  moist bulk density of 0.30 to 0.70 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 6 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 30 to 50 percent for air dried samples.  Acid oxalate iron is 1.5 to 3.5 percent.  The particle-size control section has 5 to 18 percent field estimated clay and 20 to 40 percent sand.\nThe combined thickness of the O horizon is 1 to 14 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and 2 or 3 dry.  It has 20 to 40 percent organic matter.  It has 5 to 20 cmol/kg of aluminum.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 3 or 4 moist and 3, 5, or 6 dry, and chroma of 3, 4, or 6 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly medial silt loam, extremely gravelly medial silt loam, or extremely gravelly medial loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.
