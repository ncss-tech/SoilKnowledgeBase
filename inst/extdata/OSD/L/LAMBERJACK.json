  "OVERVIEW": "The Lamberjack series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy, gravelly, and sandy outwash 152 to 203 cm (60 to 80 inches) thick overlying till. These soils are on outwash plains and in outwash areas on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 cm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
