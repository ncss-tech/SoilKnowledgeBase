Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 13 degrees C (49 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days. Elevation is 213 to 305 meters (700 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

The well drained Oshtemo and Shawtown soils are on higher positions or more sloping positions on the outwash plain. The moderately well drained Thackery soils are on more convex or slightly higher landscape positions. The very poorly drained Alvada soils are on flats and in depressions and drainageways."

The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between November and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum, very high in the gravelly substratum, and low in the underlying till. Permeability is moderate in the solum, rapid in the gravelly substratum, and slow or very slow in the underlying till."
