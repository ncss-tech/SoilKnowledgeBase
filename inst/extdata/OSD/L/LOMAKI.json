  "OVERVIEW": "The Lomaki series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained  soils that formed in alluvium from pyroclastics and cinders.  Lomaki soils are on fan terraces or cinder cones and have slopes of 0 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
