  "OVERVIEW": "The Lemoyne series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on high flood plains.  They formed in eolian sand deposited over loamy and sandy alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 43 centimeters (17 inches).  The mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C. (50 degrees F.)",
