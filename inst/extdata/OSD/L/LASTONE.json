  "OVERVIEW": "The Lastone series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone and siltstones. Lastone soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
