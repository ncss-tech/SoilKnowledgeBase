    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to a C horizon of Permian age redbed claystone and siltstone is 60 to more than 80 inches. The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches thick and extends into the upper part of the argillic horizon. Clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 45 percent. Secondary carbonates are within 22 inches of the surface. A calcic horizon is below 30 inches. A few gravel and/or cobble sized fragments of dolomitic limestone are on the surface or in the soil of some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 (3 moist) and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silty clay loam or clay loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Effervescence ranges from none to slight.\nThe Bt horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Effervescence is slight or strong.\nThe Btk horizons have hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay. Visible carbonates in the form of concretions, films, threads, or masses range from 2 to 20 percent by volume. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 40 percent. Effervescence is strong or violent. Reaction is moderately alkaline.\nThe BCk horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 7. Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay. Most pedons contain few to common paragravel of claystone or siltstone and gravel or cobble size fragments of dolomite. Visible carbonates in the form of concretions, films, threads, or masses range from 1 to 10 percent by volume. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 25 percent. Effervescence is strong or violent. Reaction is moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6. Discontinuous spots and/or layers of olive-gray or greenish-gray are in some pedons. Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay. Most pedons contain few to common paragravel of claystone or siltstone and gravel or cobble size fragments of dolomitic limestone. A few visible carbonates are in some pedons. Effervescence is slight or strong. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Cr horizon that consists of interbedded layers of weakly consolidated claystone and siltstone in shades of red, brown, gray, or green. Thin layers of dolomitic limestone or gypsum also occur in some pedons. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Effervescence ranges from very slight to strong."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bexar, Frankirk, Lawton, Luckenbach, Rowden, Sagerton, and Swenson series. Bexar, Rowden, and Swenson soils are moderately deep to limestone. Frankirk and Lawton soils have secondary carbonates deeper than 30 inches. Also, Lawton and Luckenbach soils do not have a calcic horizon. Sagerton soils have an argillic horizon to 80 inches and deeper. In addition, Frankirk, Luckenbach, and Sagerton soils are on Pleistocene age terraces."

The soil formed in local alluvial or colluvial sediments deposited over Permian age redbed claystone and siltstone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 26 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 64 degrees F. Frost free days range from 200 to 230 days and elevation ranges from 1,400 to 2,100 feet. Thornthwaite annual P-E indices ranges from 32 to 40."

Aspermont soils have a fine-silty particle-size control section, have an ochric epipedon, and are on higher convex landscape positions. Cottonwood, Harmon, and Talpa soils are very shallow or shallow to bedrock, and are on higher summit landscape positions. Nipsum soils are found in lower depressional areas and have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: La Casa series was originally established in 1940 in Harmon County, Oklahoma and later placed on the inactive list in 1968. The series was reactivated for the Jackson County, Oklahoma, update survey in 2000 to describe soils similar to the concept of the original series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon--0 to 12 inches (Ap and Bt horizons).\nArgillic horizon--6 to 64 inches (Bt and Btk horizons).\nCalcic horizon--34 to 81 inches (Btk2, Btk3, and BCk horizons).\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is based on data from Jackson County, OK.\nRange Site: Clay Loam - 078BY072TX\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL data from type location in Jackson County, Oklahoma (S97OK-065-002).\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
