  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lozeau series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from semi-consolidated welded tuff.  These soils are on mountain slopes and escarpments.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
