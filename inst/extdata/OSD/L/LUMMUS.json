    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Weighted average clay content of the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon is 35 to 50 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Reaction is slightly acid through strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Mottles in shades of gray or yellow range from none to common.  Reaction is slightly acid through strongly acid.\nThe Bt part of the B/E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Mottles in shades of red occur on some ped faces.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam or clay.  The tongues of E material range from 1 to 4 cm wide and have hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The tongues contain less clay and are fine sandy loam or loam.  The volume occupied by tongues ranges from 15 to 30 percent.  Reaction of the B/E horizon is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 8.  Mottles of red, yellow, brown and gray range from few to many, or the matrix is mottled in shades of red, gray and yellow.  Texture is clay or sandy clay with clay content of 40 to 60 percent.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe Bt2 horizon has matrix hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 to 8.  Mottles of red, yellow, brown, and gray range from few to many.   The texture is typically clay, but ranges to sandy clay loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has colors in shades of red, gray, yellow or brown with few to many mottles.  Texture is variable and ranges from sandy clay loam to clay.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to mildly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Atasco and Rodessa soils in the same family and the similar Alazan, Chazos, Depcor, Freestone, Kurth, Nimrod, Rader, Raino and Robco soils.  The Atasco soils have a grayer matrix in the lower subsoil, have slightly warmer soil temperature, have a summer moisture deficit of less than 4 inches, and are typically on Coastal terraces of Pleistocene Age.  The Rodessa soils have matrix hues redder than 7.5YR in the Bt, contain more silt and clay in the A and E horizons and are typically formed in mounded surfaces of Pleistocene sediments.  Alazan, Depcor, Freestone, and Kurth soils have fine-loamy control sections.  The Chazos, Nimrod, Rader and Robco soils are in ustic moisture regimes.  In addition Nimrod and Robco soils have arenic surface layers, Rader soils have fine-loamy control sections, and Raino soils have fine- loamy over clayey control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lummus soils occupy gently sloping  uplands.  These soils are on concave side slope or foot slope positions or are near the heads of drainageways.   Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  The soil formed in sandy and clayey sediments.  Geology at the type location is the Queen City Formation of the Eocene Age.   The mean annual temperature ranges from about 64 to 68 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 45 inches and Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 64 to 80.  Summer rainfall ranges from 25 to 30 inches and the summer moisture deficit ranges from 4 to 6 inches."

The Cuthbert, Kirvin and Tenaha soils are on higher ridges and side slopes and have thinner sola.  The Flo, Larue, Pickton, Tonkawa and Wolfpen soils are mainly on broad smooth areas in higher better drained positions and have thick sandy surface layers.  Oakwood soils are on higher better drained positions and contain plinthite."
