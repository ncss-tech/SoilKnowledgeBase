    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bly, Hess, Melhorn, Raycreek (T), Salcreek (T) and Vangoe (T) series. All these soils lack buried genetic horizons. Bly soils have mollic epipedons 20 to 30 inches thick and durinodes in the lower argillic horizon. Hess soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock. Melhorn soils do not have coarse loamy buried E horizons or clayey buried Bt horizons. Raycreek soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. Salcreek soils have greater than 50 percent sand in the particle-size control section and rock fragments are dominantly of glacial till origin. Vangoe soils have mollic epipedons 20 to 33 inches thick and are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock.\nRunyon (T) soils have a similar classification with mixed mineralogy and is 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact (vesicular basalt)."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lidos soils are on mountains slopes and hill backslopes and footslopes at elevations of 3,850 to 5,900 feet. These soils formed in colluvium from basalt mixed with volcanic ash in the upper part over alluvium from fine pyroclastic materials and basalt. Slopes range from 4 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is 26 to 32 inches. The average annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."
