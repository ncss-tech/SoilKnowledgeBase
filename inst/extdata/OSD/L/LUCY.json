  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the A and E horizons except where lime has been added, and from extremely acid to strongly acid in the subsoil.  Thickness of the A horizon plus the E horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is sand, coarse sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is sand, coarse sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Some pedons have an upper Bt horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR but less than 10 inches thick   Clay content ranges from 10 to 30 percent. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon has the same hues and values as the upper part.  Clay content ranges from 20 to 45 percent.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, and below a depth of about 50 inches, sandy clay.  Mottles in shades of brown and yellow range from none to common.  Content of nodular plinthite is less than 5 percent by volume within 60 inches of the surface.  Content of rounded quartz gravel plus ironstone nodules is less than 10 percent by volume."

Autryville and Lowndes soils are bisequal.  Bonneau, Lovett, Rosalie, and Trep soils have mottles of chroma 2 or less within 60 inches of the surface and have dominant hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the Bt horizon.  Boykin and Briley soils have sandy epipedons with less than 15 percent sand that is medium or coarser.  In addition, Boykin and Briley soils are dry in the moisture control section for more than 75 days in most years.  Letney and Wagram soils have Bt horizons dominated by hue of 7.5YR or yellower."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lucy soils are on ridge tops and side slopes on uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain.  Slopes are dominantly 2 to 15 percent, but range from 0 to 45 percent.  They formed in unconsolidated, sandy and loamy marine and fluvial sediments of the Pliocene, Miocene, Oligocene, and Eocene series of the Tertiary system.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 63 to 68 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 48 to 60 inches."

Bama, Orangeburg, and Ruston soils are generally on slightly lower positions than Lucy soils and do not have a sandy epipedon as thick as 20 inches.  Dothan and Fuquay soils are on smoother, less sloping positions and have more than 5 percent plinthite within 60 inches of the surface.  In addition, Dothan soils have a sandy epipedon less than 20 inches thick.  Eustis soils are on similar positions as Lucy soils and have a sandy Bt horizon.  Saffell, Smithdale, Springhill, and Troup soils are in similar positions as Lucy soils.  Saffell, Smithdale, and Springhill soils do not have a thick sandy epipedon.  Troup soils have a sandy epipedon thicker than 40 inches."
