  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 36 degrees to 47 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature is 59 degrees to 62 degrees F. Depth to soft calcareous shale is 20 to 40 inches. Depth to the base of the B2t is 10 to 15 inches. The soils commonly are noncalcareous throughout. A few pedons are weakly calcareous in the lower part of the C horizon. The A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR; value of 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist; and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. It is neutral or mildly alkaline fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam. The B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist. It is neutral or mildly alkaline sandy loam averaging between 10 and 18 percent clay and more than 50 percent fine sand or coarser.  Hue of the C horizon is 5Y through 10YR. It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline. It ranges from sandy loam to loamy sand."

Mean annual temperature is 34 degrees to 45 degrees F.  Annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches. Elevation is 6,000 to 7,000 feet.  The growing season is 80 to 110 days, but frost may occur in any month."
