Depth to a discontinuity to loamy coastal plains sediments (2Btx horizon) is more than 48 inches.  The soil has a single clay maximum in the Bt horizon. Sand content throughout the solum is usually less than 10 percent but may range up to 15 percent. The A and B horizons range from moderately acid through very strongly acid. The C horizon ranges from slightly acid through very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. A few yellowish brown skeletons and mottles in shades of brown are in some pedons. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. The lower part of the Bt horizon may have gray iron depletions.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Iron accumulations are in various shades of yellow or brown, and iron depletions are in shades of gray, or it is variegated in shades of gray, brown, or yellow. It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon, and BC horizon, where present, has colors similar to the lower part of the Btx horizon. Texture is silt loam.\nA 2Btx horizon is present in some pedons below a depth of 48 inches.  It has colors similar to the Btx horizon.  Texture is sandy loam or loam."

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of about 7 inches (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from about 7 inches to 28 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon and fragipan - the zone from about 28 inches to 50 inches (Btx1, Btx2, Btx3 horizons).\nClassification only was changed in 7/94. Competing series and other items will be updated later.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
