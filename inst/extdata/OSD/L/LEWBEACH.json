    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 102 to 183 cm (40 to 72 in) or more. Depth to bedrock is usually greater than 152 cm (60 in). Depth to the fragipan ranges from 43 to 91 cm (17 to 36 in). Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent by volume in the A and Bw horizons and from 15 to 50 percent in the Bx and C horizons. Reaction, where unlimed ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum, and strongly acid to slightly acid in the C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. Dry color value is 6 or more. It is silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable. Where an A horizon is present, thickness ranges from 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 in).\nThe Bw horizon has hue or 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak to strong, medium or fine subangular blocky.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is granular, platy or subangular blocky and consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Gray or brown redoximorphic features may be present. Prism face colors range from weak red (2.5YR 5/2) to light brown (7.5YR 6/4). It has very coarse prismatic structure with platy, blocky or massive interiors.\nThe C or Cd horizon, where present, has color and texture similar to those of the Bx horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lewbeach soils are gently sloping to very steep soils on glaciated uplands. Slope ranges from 3 to 55 percent. The soils developed in very firm, acid till high in sandstone with a smaller component of red shale. The climate is humid and is cool in summer and cold in winter. Annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 9 degrees C (39 to 48 degrees F). Annual precipitation ranges from 825 to 1790 mm (32 to 70 in) and the frost free days range from 110 to 155 days. Elevation ranges from 425 to 1100 m (1394 to 3608 ft) above sea level."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Lewbeach was proposed as the frigid equivalent of Lackawanna. As defined for Sullivan County, it ranged to cover soils mapped as Swartswood in the frigid region.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in) (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - from 23 to 48 cm (9 to 19 in) (Bw horizon).\n3. Fragipan - from 69 to183 cm (27 to 72 in) (Bx1 and Bx2 horizons).\n4. Udic soil moisture regime (humid, temperate climate).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available for 2 pedons from Delaware County, NY (S86NY025-010,011) and 1 pedon from Allegany County, NY (S10NY003002).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
