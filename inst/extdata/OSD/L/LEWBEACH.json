  "OVERVIEW": "The Lewbeach series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in till derived from sandstone, siltstone and shale. They are gently sloping to steep soils on hillsides and hilltops on uplands. A dense fragipan is present beginning at a depth of 43 to 91 cm (17 to 36 in).  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the mineral soil above the fragipan and low or moderately low in and below the fragipan. Slope ranges from 3 to 55 percent. Mean annual temperature is 7 degrees C (45 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is 1120 mm (44 in).",

Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in) (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - from 23 to 48 cm (9 to 19 in) (Bw horizon).\n3. Fragipan - from 69 to183 cm (27 to 72 in) (Bx1 and Bx2 horizons).\n4. Udic soil moisture regime (humid, temperate climate)."
