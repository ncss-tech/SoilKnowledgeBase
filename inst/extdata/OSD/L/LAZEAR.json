  "REVDATE": "12/2017",
  "STATES": "CO,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lazear series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or slope alluvium over residuum derived from interbedded sedimentary rock. Lazear soils are on structural benches, canyon walls, dip slopes, scarp slopes and homoclinal ridges. Slopes are 0 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 279 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
