  "OVERVIEW": "The Langhei series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in calcareous glacial till on glacial moraines.  These soils have moderate or moderately slow permeability.  Slopes range from 2 to 55 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Carbonates are typically in all parts of the profile but in some uncultivated areas the A horizon may be leached.  The particle size control section typically averages between 18 and 25 percent clay, with an extreme range 18 to 30 percent.  It averages 15 to 40 percent fine sand and coarser.  It typically has about 2 to 10 percent by volume of rock fragments of mixed lithology.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. The A horizon in noncultivated areas has 10YR hue, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2, and ranges from 2 to 4 inches in thickness.  After mixing the upper 7 inches, moist values exceed 3 and/or dry values exceed 5.  The A horizon is loam or clay loam.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is loam or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 30 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The C horizon is loam or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from about 10 to 20 percent.\nMottles are common in this horizon but are believed to be relict and not representative of current soil moisture."

The Langhei soils formed in calcareous loam or clay loam glacial till that is Late Wisconsinan in age.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from about 38 to 45 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from about 16 to 27 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 150.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 1000 to 2000 feet."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  Ochric epipedon from 0 to 6 inches (Ap horizon); calcic horizon - the zone from 6 to 15 inches (Bk horizon).\nThe mottles in the C horizons are not considered as redoximorphic features associated with present day saturation.  They are most likely relic from a much wetter climatic period.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Results of some laboratory analysis on the typical pedon are recorded under Minn. Ag. Exp. Station Central File Code 770.  See also MAES, CFC number 3173 for lab data for a representative pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
