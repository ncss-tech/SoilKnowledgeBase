  "OVERVIEW": "The Luzena series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, residuum and colluvium from volcanic rock. Luzena soils are on mesas, hills and mountains and have slopes of 2 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
