  "OVERVIEW": "The Lindquist series consist of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits on outwash plains, ground moraines, end moraines, stream terraces and kames. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",
