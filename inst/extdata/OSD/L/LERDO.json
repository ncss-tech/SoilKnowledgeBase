  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil between depths of 4 and 12 inches is dry in all parts from April 1 until December 1 and is moist in some or all parts for 50 to 90 consecutive days during the winter.  It is not moist for as long as 90 cumulative days.  Mean annual soil temperature is 66 degrees F. and is always above 47 degrees F.  Saline-alkali phases are recognized.  The soil is moderately or strongly alkaline (pH 7.8-9.0).\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/1 or 5/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/1 or 3/2.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 3 percent to a depth of more than 20 inches and decreases irregularly with increasing depth.  It is heavy loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam and averages 25 to 35 percent clay.  The EC is less than 3.0 mmhos/cm and the ESP is less than 11.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/1, 6/1, 6/2, 7/2; 2.5Y 6/2, 7/1 or 7/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/1, 4/2, 5/3, 6/3; 2.5Y 4/2 or 5/2.  It is loam or light clay loam and is weakly stratified.  Clay content is 20 to 30 percent.  The C horizons have an EC of 1 to 8, but average 6 mmhos/cm and the ESP ranges from 1 to more than 70 but averages 30."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lerdo soils are on alluvial plains and basins.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium from granite, shale, or sandstone.  Elevations are 235 to 275 feet.  The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool, somewhat moist winters.  Summer rains are rare.  Mean annual precipitation is 5 or 6 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 46 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 83 degrees F., mean annual temperature is 63 degrees to 65 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 250 to 300 days."

Garces and Milham soils have an argillic horizon.  Kimberlina soils are coarse-loamy.  Lokern soils are fine.  Panoche soils have an organic carbon content that decreases regularly with increasing depth.  Jerryslu soils have a duripan and a natric horizon."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil is not classified as a Mollisol because the epipedon is not moist for 90 cumulative days in 7 out of 10 years when not irrigated.  It would be classified as a Mollic Torrifluvent if this subgroup were adopted.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in February of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
