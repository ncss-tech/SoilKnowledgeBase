  "OVERVIEW": "The Lonepine series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, glaciofluvial, or lacustrine deposits.  These soils are on lake plains and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
