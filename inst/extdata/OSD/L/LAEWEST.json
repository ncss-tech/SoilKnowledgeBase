    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nThe solum thickness is more than 200 cm (80 in).\nThis is a cyclic soil and undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microhighs 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in) higher than microlows.  Distance from the center of the microhighs to the center of the microlows ranges from about 1.2 to 4.9 m (4 to 16 ft).   The microhigh makes up about 20 percent, the intermediate, or area between the knoll and depression about 50 percent, and the microlow about 30 percent.\nThe amplitude of waviness between mollic colored materials in the upper part of the solum and the higher value colors in the lower part ranges from about 30 to 150 cm (12 to 60 in).  The chimneys of high value materials on microhighs make up 2 to 5 percent of the surface area.  They are mainly 0.6 to 2.4 m (2 to 8 ft) long and 0.2 to 0.6 m (1/2 to 2 ft) wide.\nWhen dry, the soil has cracks 1 to 5 cm (about 1/2 to 2 in) wide at the surface and commonly 1 cm (1/2 inch) wide cracks extend to a depth of 1.2 m (4 ft) during the summer.  The cracks remain open for less than 90 cumulative days in most years.\nSlickensides begin at a depth of 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 in) and extend throughout the solum.  The angle of the slickensides ranges from about 10 to 65 degrees from horizontal and tend to be more vertical in microhighs than in microlows.\nSome pedons have an overwash of calcareous clay or silty clay 20 to 51 cm (8 to 20 in) thick.\nSoil Moisture: An udic soil moisture regime.  The soil moisture control section is not dry in some or all parts for as long as 90 cumulative days in normal years.
