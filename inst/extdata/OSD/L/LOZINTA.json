The soil formed in slope alluvium derived dominantly from pyroclastics and cinders.  The climate is warm and semi-arid.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 18 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and winter rain and snow.  Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 150 days."
