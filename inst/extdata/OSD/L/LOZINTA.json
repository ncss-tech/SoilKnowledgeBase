  "OVERVIEW": "The Lozinta series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in slope alluvium from pyroclastics and cinders.  Lozinta soils are on cinder cones and have slopes of 1 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The soil formed in slope alluvium derived dominantly from pyroclastics and cinders.  The climate is warm and semi-arid.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 18 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and winter rain and snow.  Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 150 days."
