  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 50 inches. Depth to carbonates is greater than 40 inches. Content of rock fragments in the A horizon is 0 to 5 percent, and in the Bw and C horizons commonly is 0 to 15 percent. Rock fragments are predominantly sandstone, siltstone, or shale.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4 (4 to 6 dry), and chroma of 1 to 3. Many pedons have an Ap horizon up to 10 inches thick that has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 (6 dry), and chroma of 2 or 3. The A or Ap horizon commonly is silt loam or loam and less commonly sandy loam or fine sandy loam. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 or 5; chroma of 3 or 4. Redoximorphic features of low chroma at a depth of 15 to 24 inches. Some pedons have thin layers that have value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2. The Bw horizon commonly is silt loam or loam, and less commonly has subhorizons of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam; the particle size control section is 18 to 30 percent clay and 15 to 40 percent sand coarser than very fine. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 8. It commonly is silt loam or loam and less commonly sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or fine sand. It ranges from highly stratified to relatively uniform. Horizons below 40 inches may include thin sandy gravelly and stony layers. It is moderately acid to neutral."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lobdell soils are on nearly level flood plains receiving loamy alluvium from upland areas of sandstone, shale, and low lime glacial drift. The slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. These soils mainly are in areas of Wisconsinan or Illinoian glaciation, but also are in unglaciated valleys. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 34 to 43 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from about 47 to 57 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Chagrin, Holly, and Orrville soils and the Canfield, Cardington, Chili, Conotton, Mahoning, Rittman, and Wheeling soils. Chagrin, Holly, and Orrville soils are in toposequence with Lobdell soils. The well drained Chagrin soils are better drained and are on higher landscape positions than Lobdell soils. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Holly soils and somewhat poorly drained Orrville soils are in lower landscape positions than Lobdell soils. Canfield, Cardington, Mahoning, and Rittman soils commonly are on nearby till plains. Chili, Conotton, and Wheeling soils have argillic horizons and are on nearby terraces."
