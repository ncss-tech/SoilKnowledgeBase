  "OVERVIEW": "The Leeko series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  Leeko soils are on strath terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
