Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid except in the surface layers where limed.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is silt loam, loam, gravelly silt loam, or gravelly loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less, or is neutral.  Redoximorphic features range from few to many in shades of yellow, brown, and red.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam or loam.\nThe Cg horizon has colors and texture similar to that of the Bg horizon."

Atkins soils have mixed mineralogy, are mesic and normally contain fewer fragments.  Bibb soils are coarse-loamy.  Kinston soils do not contain coarse fragments.  Melvin soils are fine-silty, have mixed mineralogy and are mesic.  Mhoon soils are fine-silty and Waverly soils are coarse-silty and have mixed mineralogy."
