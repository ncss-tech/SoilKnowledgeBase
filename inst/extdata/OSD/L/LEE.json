Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid except in the surface layers where limed.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is silt loam, loam, gravelly silt loam, or gravelly loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less, or is neutral.  Redoximorphic features range from few to many in shades of yellow, brown, and red.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam or loam.\nThe Cg horizon has colors and texture similar to that of the Bg horizon."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Similar soils are the Atkins, Bibb, Kinston, Melvin, Mhoon, and Waverly series.  Atkins soils have mixed mineralogy, are mesic and normally contain fewer fragments.  Bibb soils are coarse-loamy.  Kinston soils do not contain coarse fragments.  Melvin soils are fine-silty, have mixed mineralogy and are mesic.  Mhoon soils are fine-silty and Waverly soils are coarse-silty and have mixed mineralogy."

They formed in loamy alluvium washed from soils formed in material weathered from cherty limestone, or interbedded cherty limestone, shale, and sandstone .  Near the type location the average annual temperature is about 60.5 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 56.9 inches"

Other upland soils on hillsides, footslopes, and summit shoulders include Hawthorne, Sengtown, Biffle, Minvale, and Mountview soils.  All of these are well drained or somewhat excessively drained ."
