  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to carbonates ranges from 25 to 65 inches. Gravel, dominated by shale, ranges from 1 to 8 percent by volume, but some pedons do not have rock fragments in the upper part. The sand fraction of these soils is dominated by shale.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. The E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. Some pedons have redoximorphic features. The A and E horizons are loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. They are slightly or moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon has a matrix hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2, above depths of 30 inches, but at least some subhorizon has chroma of 3 or 4 in 40 percent or more of the matrix. Below depths of 30 inches, hue is 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It has few to many and faint to prominent Fe depletions and concentrations. It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay with a B/A clay ratios of 1.2 to 1.4. It averages between 35 and 45 percent clay and from 10 to 30 percent sand at least in the upper 20 inches. It has subhorizons with as much as 55 percent clay in some pedons. It is moderately to very strongly acid in the upper part and moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part.\nThe Bw, Bk or C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. It has few or common masses of lime in the upper part."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lerdal soils have plane or convex slopes on gently sloping to moderately steep or hilly glacial moraines. Slope gradients are commonly 2 to 8 percent but range from 1 to 18 percent. Lerdal soils formed in about 3 to 10 feet or more of moderately fine or fine textured clayey glacial till or flow till, high in content of shale over calcareous loam or clay loam till common to the Des Moines lobe of the Late Wisconsinan glacial stage. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 125 to 172 days. Elevation ranges from 800 to 1,500 feet above sea level."

Moderately well drained Kilkenny soils have more convex slopes or are on higher lying terrain. The somewhat poorly drained Shields soils are on nearly level terrain. Poorly drained Mazaska soils are in nearby shallow depressions, swales, and low lying level areas."
