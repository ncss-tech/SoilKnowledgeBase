The soils are usually moist, but are dry in the soil moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days during summer and fall.  The upper 15 to 25 inches of the 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.80 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  It has 0 to 40 pumice and 0 to 40 percent gravel with a weighted average of less than 35 percent.  Depth to the 2C horizon is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR value of 5 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry or moist. Below 10 inches the texture is paragravelly ashy fine sandy loam, very paragravelly ashy fine sandy loam, paragravelly ashy sandy loam,  very paragravelly ashy sandy loam, very gravelly ashy sandy loam, gravelly ashy sandy loam, or gravelly ashy fine sandy loam. Some pedons have BC or C horizons. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2C horizon is very gravelly coarse sand, extremely gravelly coarse sand, extremely gravelly sand, or extremely cobbly coarse sand. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral."
