  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 80 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 48 inches.  Depth to fragipan ranges from 24 to 38 inches.  The silty mantle ranges in thickness from 36 to 80 inches.  Rock fragments in the solum, normally less than 10 percent by volume, have been weathered from shale, siltstone, sandstone or other underlying materials.  Reaction throughout the soil ranges from very strongly to moderately acid when unlimed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam with 18 to 34 percent clay in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is weak to moderate fine to coarse subangular blocky.  The Bx horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 6 with many low chroma mottles in hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y.  Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Structure is weak to moderate, coarse or very coarse prismatic parting to platy.\nThe C horizon is similar in color, texture, and structure to the Bx horizon.  Some pedons have an unconforming C horizon which varies in thickness, color, and amount of rock fragments depending on the underlying material."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Aldino, Ava, Boston, Cincinnati, Grantsburg, Hildebrecht, Hosmer, Mercer, Nicholson, Otwell, Rainsboro, Weisburg, and Zanesville series are in the same family.  Aldino soils have rock fragments of serpentine.  Ava soils have a BA horizon immediately above the fragipan.  Boston, Mercer, and Nicholson soils have more clay and less silt in the lower solum.  Cincinnati soils have unconforming loamy glacial material with 40 inches.  Grantsburg soils lack a lithologic discontinuity.  Hosmer soils have an E' horizon immediately above the fragipan.  Otwell soils are formed in a loess mantle overlying lacustrine or old alluvial material.  Rainsboro soils have unconforming water deposited or stratified material within 40 inches.  Weisburg soils contain glacial erratics.  Zanesville soils developed in loess overlying acid sandstone, siltstone, and shale."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils occur on nearly level to sloping uplands and terraces with an extreme slope range from 0 to 15 percent.  The regolith consists largely of silty materials which mantle a wide range of consolidated and unconsolidated deposits.  Climate is humid and temperate with mean annual temperature of 50 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation of 40 to 46 inches, and a growing season of 140 to 200 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Lawrenceville is a member of a drainage sequence which includes the well drained Duncannon, somewhat poorly drained Chalfont and the poorly drained Doylestown soils.  The Abbottstown, Chester, Croton, Glenelg, Lansdale, Penn and Readington soils are nearby.  Abbottstown, Croton, Penn and Readington soils have reddish hues inherited from parent materials.  Chester, Glenelg, and Lansdale are well drained soils which lack fragipans and have loamy textures with more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  Duncannon soils do not have fragipans."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 1.  Ochric epepidon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 13 inches (Ap and BA horizons). 2.  Argillic horizon - the zone from 13 inches to a depth of about 25 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons). 3.  Fragipan - the zone from 25 inches to a depth of about 44 inches (Bx1 and Bx2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data for Lawrenceville is available from samples taken from Montgomery County, S60Pa-46-2-(1-8), Pennsylvania.\nClassification only was changed in 11/94, competing series and other changes will be made later.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
