The soils formed in alluvium from granitic rocks and andesite with additions of wind borne saline-alkali material.  The climate is cool, and arid having warm dry summers and cold dry winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 125 to 150 mm.  Mean annual temperature is about 10 to 12 degrees C.  The frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
