  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to sandstone bedrock ranges from 6 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, stony fine sandy loam, or stony loam. Content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 20 percent by volume. Coarse fragments less than 3 inches in diameter range from 0 to 5 percent by volume and coarse fragments 3 to 10 inches in diameter range from 0 to 15 percent by volume. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, gravelly loam, or gravelly fine sandy loam. Content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 20 percent by volume. Coarse fragments less than 3 inches in diameter range from 0 to 20 percent by volume and coarse fragments 3 to 10 inches in diameter range from 0 to 5 percent by volume. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Cr horizon is very weakly to moderately cemented sandstone bedrock that can be dug with a spade or auger. The Cr horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral. This material is paralithic with a high or very high excavation difficulty. Some strata have an extremely high excavation difficulty, but these areas are small. Fractures are greater than 10 cm apart. This material is dense enough to be root restrictive."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no series in the same family.  Soils in similar families are Darnell, Darsil, Lucien, Cottonwood, Eddy and Harmon  series. Darnell soils can have redder hues, a cambic horizon, steeper slopes and have a mean annual air temperature less than 64 degree Fairenheight.  Darsil soils have a sandy textural control section. Lucien soils have mixed mineralogy and have a mollic epipedon.  Cottonwood, Eddy and Harmon soils are calcareous and Eddy and Harmon soils have carbonatic mineralogy"

These soils formed in residuum from sandstone of Pennsylvanian age. The climate is subhumid. Mean Annual Precipitation: 26 to 32 inches.  Mean Annual Air Temperature: 64 to 65 degrees F. Thornthwaite Annual P-E indices: 36 to 50.  Elevation is 900 to 1600 feet."
