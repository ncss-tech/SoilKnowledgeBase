  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Loving series consists of very shallow and shallow over sandstone bedrock, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable loamy soils that formed in loamy residuum from sandstone bedrock. These soils are on ridges. Slopes are 1 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 26 to 32 inches. Mean annual temperature is 64 or 65 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to sandstone bedrock ranges from 6 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, stony fine sandy loam, or stony loam. Content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 20 percent by volume. Coarse fragments less than 3 inches in diameter range from 0 to 5 percent by volume and coarse fragments 3 to 10 inches in diameter range from 0 to 15 percent by volume. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, gravelly loam, or gravelly fine sandy loam. Content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 20 percent by volume. Coarse fragments less than 3 inches in diameter range from 0 to 20 percent by volume and coarse fragments 3 to 10 inches in diameter range from 0 to 5 percent by volume. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Cr horizon is very weakly to moderately cemented sandstone bedrock that can be dug with a spade or auger. The Cr horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral. This material is paralithic with a high or very high excavation difficulty. Some strata have an extremely high excavation difficulty, but these areas are small. Fractures are greater than 10 cm apart. This material is dense enough to be root restrictive."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Darnell soils can have redder hues, a cambic horizon, steeper slopes and have a mean annual air temperature less than 64 degree Fairenheight.  Darsil soils have a sandy textural control section. Lucien soils have mixed mineralogy and have a mollic epipedon.  Cottonwood, Eddy and Harmon soils are calcareous and Eddy and Harmon soils have carbonatic mineralogy"
