  "OVERVIEW": "The Lares series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on alluvial fans and dissected terraces.  They formed in clayey marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 78 degrees F.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.",
