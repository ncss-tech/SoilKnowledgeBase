  "STATES": "CO,NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lanola series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from limestone.  Lanola soils are on hills, cuestas, ridges, and scarps.  Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches (400 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F (11 degrees C).",
