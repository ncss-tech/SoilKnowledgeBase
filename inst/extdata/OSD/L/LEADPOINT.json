  "OVERVIEW": "The Leadpoint series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till, residuum and colluvium from dark shaly rocks with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess. Leadpoint soils are on glaciated foothills, mountainsides and ridgetops and have slopes of 0 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The soil is usually moist in all horizons but is dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches, or to a paralithic contact for 45 to 60 consectutive days. The mean annual soil temperture is 44 to 46 degrees F. The volcanic ash and loess mantle is 7 to 18 inches thick and is estimated to be 5 to 40 percent volcanic glass and the aluuminum plus one-half iron extracted by acid oxilate is estimated to be 0.2 to 1.0 percent. The particle-size control section ranges from 10 to 40 percent shale parachanners and 15 to 35 percent hard shale channers. The soil is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or N, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 0, 1 or 2. It has fine or medium granular, or fine, medium or coarse subangular blocky structure. It has 5 to 15 percent shale parachanners and 5 to 15 percent hard shale channers.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y or N, value of 2 through 5, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 0, 1 or 2. It has fine or medium granular, or fine, medium or coarse subangular blocky structure. It has 5 to 15 percent shale parachanners and 5 to 15 percent hard shale channers.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y or N, value of 2 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 0 or 1.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Leadpoint soils are on glaciated upland hillsides, mountainsides and ridgetops at elevations of 2,500 to 5,000 feet. Slopes are often complex and are 0 to 65 percent. These soils formed in glacial till residuum and colluvium from very dark gray and black Ordovician slates, argillites, shales and siltstones, with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess. In places, the shaly parent rock is interbedded or in contact with limestone or dolomite. The climate is characterized by having warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean temperature in January is 24 degrees F., in July 66 degrees F.; and the average annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 22 to 32 inches. The frost-free season is 80 to 100 days."
