  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 66 to 140 centimeters. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon. The solum ranges from slightly acid to extremely acid. The amount of cemented material (ortstein) occurring in the solum ranges from 0 to 45 percent of the exposed area of the spodic horizon. The profile is dominantly fine sand, but includes thin layers of very fine sand.\nThe 0a horizon has a hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2, and chroma of 1, or is neutral and has value of 2.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bs horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. The Bhs and Bs horizons contain cemented materials (ortstein) that make up from 0 to 45 percent of the horizon.\nSome pedons have BC horizons with colors and textures similar to the C horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is dominantly fine sand but some pedons have a few thin strata of very fine sand. The reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Adams, Cusino, Duxbury, Kalkaska, Pence and Stutts soils and the closely related Garlic soil. Adams soils are moist within 91 centimeters of the soil surface during the month of August. Cusino soils contain greater than 15 percent coarse fragments in the BC and C horizons. Garlic soils have 50 to 90 percent ortstein in the spodic horizon. Kalkaska soils have less than 50 percent fine sand in the sand fraction throughout the series control section. The Stutts, Duxbury and Pence soils have combined content of silt plus clay greater than 15 percent in the A, E, Bhs and Bs horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Liminga soils are on relict beach ridges, dunes, moraines, outwash plains, kames and lake plains. Slope gradients range from 0 to 70 percent. The climate is continental, but is affected by Lake Superior, causing extra winter precipitation. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 690 to 840 millimeters, and mean annual temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C."

Au Gres, Halfaday, and Deford are wetter members of the drainage sequence with Liminga soils. Alcona and Munising soils are common associates in similar landscape positions on moraines. The Kalkaska soils are common associates on beach ridges and dunes."

Ground cover consists of bracken fern, spinulose shield fern, starflower, wild lily of the valley, shining club moss, wild sarsaparilla, sedges, false Solomon`s seal, red elderberry, ground pine, and wintergreen. Small areas are idle cropland, pasture, hayland, or tree plantations."
