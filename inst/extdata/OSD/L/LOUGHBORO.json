  "OVERVIEW": "The Loughboro series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils on broad upland ridges or divides.  They formed in loess overlying water worked loamy and clayey sediments from granite bedrock. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.",
