    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on nearly level to gentle slope on broad upland ridges, divides or small plateaus.  They are adjacent to higher lying hills or mountains of igneous origin. They formed in loess overlying water worked loamy sediments from granite bedrock.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F."
