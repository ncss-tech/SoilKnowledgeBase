  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the sandy skeletal mantle and depth to sandstone bedrock ranges from 25 to 51 centimeters. The rock fragments consist mainly of angular sandstone fragments with some rounded igneous and metamorphic gravel and cobbles present in some pedons. Volume of rock fragments averages from 35 to 70 percent in the particle-size control section. The volume of channers and gravel ranges from 15 to 40 percent and the volume of flagstones and cobbles ranges from 15 to 50 percent throughout the pedon.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, or is neutral, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 or 1. Reaction is very strongly acid or extremely acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is extremely flaggy sand or the very channery or very flaggy analogues of these textures. Reaction is very strongly acid or extremely acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4. It is extremely flaggy sand or very channery or very flaggy analogues of these textures. Reaction is strongly acid or extremely acid.\nSome pedons have a C horizon that has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. It has textures similar to the Bw horizon. It is very strongly acid."

Levasseur soils formed in sandy and flaggy waved worked glaciofluvial deposits mainly derived from Jacobsville sandstone. Elevation ranges from 185 to 253 meters. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 790 to 860 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 6 degrees C. The frost-free period ranges from 120 to 140 days."
