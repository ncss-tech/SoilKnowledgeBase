  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Levasseur series consists of shallow, somewhat poorly drained soils on bedrock benches. These soils formed in sandy and very channery wave worked glaciofluvial deposits mainly derived from the underlying Jacobsville sandstone. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very high in the sandy mineral horizons and moderately high in the sandstone bedrock. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 790 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the sandy skeletal mantle and depth to sandstone bedrock ranges from 25 to 51 centimeters. The rock fragments consist mainly of angular sandstone fragments with some rounded igneous and metamorphic gravel and cobbles present in some pedons. Volume of rock fragments averages from 35 to 70 percent in the particle-size control section. The volume of channers and gravel ranges from 15 to 40 percent and the volume of flagstones and cobbles ranges from 15 to 50 percent throughout the pedon.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, or is neutral, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 or 1. Reaction is very strongly acid or extremely acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is extremely flaggy sand or the very channery or very flaggy analogues of these textures. Reaction is very strongly acid or extremely acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4. It is extremely flaggy sand or very channery or very flaggy analogues of these textures. Reaction is strongly acid or extremely acid.\nSome pedons have a C horizon that has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. It has textures similar to the Bw horizon. It is very strongly acid."
