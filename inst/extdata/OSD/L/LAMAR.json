  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 50 inches.  The A and B horizons range from neutral to moderately alkaline and calcareous or noncalcareous.  Films, threads, and calcium carbonate concretions in the B and C horizons range from barely discernable to an estimated 20 percent by volume, but comprise less than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  In some pedons the A horizon has moist values of less than 3.5 in the upper 7 inches.  It is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe B and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Some pedons have a few yellowish and brownish mottles.  They are loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Less than 15 percent of the sand is coarser than very fine sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series in the same family.  Similar series are the Altoga, Aspermont, Cuthand, Enterprise, Karnes, Obaro, Shep, Throck, Venus, Weymouth, Wise, and Woodward series.  Aspermont and Obaro soils are dry for longer periods and are redder than 10YR. Altoga and Karnes soils have more than 40 percent carbonates in some horizons and in addition, Altoga soils have more than 35 percent total clay in the control section.  Enterprise and Woodward soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Cuthand soils have less than 18 percent silicate clay in the control section and have carbonatic mineralogy.  Shep, Venus and Weymouth soils have more than 15 percent material coarser than very fine sand in the control section, and in addition, Venus soils have mollic epipedons and the Weymouth soils are dry for longer periods.  The Throck soils are more clayey and are dry for longer periods of time.  The Wise soils have siliceous mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gently sloping to moderately steep, rolling or hilly erosional uplands, mainly in breaks between level uplands and flood plains.  Slope gradients range from 1 to 20 percent but are mainly between 5 and 12 percent.  The soil formed in calcareous, loamy, marine sediments of Cretaceous Age.  Climate is moist subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 40 inches, mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 67 degrees F., Frost free days range from 220 to 250 days and elevation ranges from 400 to 800 feet.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 44 to 64."

Crockett and Wilson soils have clayey Bt horizons.  Ferris, Heiden, and Houston Black soils are clayey and have intersecting slickensides.  Lewisville soils have mollic epipedons and more than 35 percent clay in the control section."
