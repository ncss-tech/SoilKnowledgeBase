  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Llanos series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on foot slopes and alluvial fans.  They formed in material that weathered from basic volcanic rock.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.",
