  "OVERVIEW": "The Libbings series consists of moderately deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and residuum from shale.  Libbings soils occur on low rolling hills and in drainageways. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

They are developed in residuum and alluvium from saline marine shale in areas where irrigation water or seepage from canals has caused salts to accumulate.  The climate is semiarid, with mean annual temperature of 45 to 53 degrees.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 11 inches with peak periods in July to October and evenly distributed throughout the remainder of the year.  Freeze-free period ranges from 110 to 160 days."

Billings soils are very deep and lack very strong salt horizons."
