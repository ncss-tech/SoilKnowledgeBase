Cache soils are very deep and lack gypsum accumulations.  Lodalley and Saltair soils are in a fine-silty family.  Parran soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Libbings soils are on the footslopes of low rolling hills and drainageways.  Elevation is 4,000 to 6,500 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  They are developed in residuum and alluvium from saline marine shale in areas where irrigation water or seepage from canals has caused salts to accumulate.  The climate is semiarid, with mean annual temperature of 45 to 53 degrees.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 11 inches with peak periods in July to October and evenly distributed throughout the remainder of the year.  Freeze-free period ranges from 110 to 160 days."

Killpack soils lack very strong salt horizons above 20 inches.  Chipeta and Persayo are less than 20 inches deep over shale and lack very strong salt horizons.  Billings soils are very deep and lack very strong salt horizons."
