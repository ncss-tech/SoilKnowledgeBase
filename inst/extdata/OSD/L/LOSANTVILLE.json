  "OVERVIEW": "The Losantville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are shallow to dense till. Losantville soils formed in loamy till. They are on till plains. Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",

Thrifton and Wapahani soils average less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Other closely related soils that are not in the shallow family are the Aaron, Alsup, Brookside, Derinda, Ebal, Goodson, Miamian, Morrisville, Shircliff, Skrainka, Useful, and Vincent series. Aaron, Morrisville, and Useful soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Alsup and Goodson soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Brookside soils are deeper than 50 cm (20 inches) to carbonates. Derinda soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Ebal, Miamian, Shircliff, Skrainka, and Vincent soils are more than 50 cm (20 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon."

The Losantville soils are in a drainage sequence with the moderately well drained Celina soils, the somewhat poorly drained Crosby soils, and the poorly drained Cyclone and Treaty soils. The Celina soils have gray iron depletions in the upper part of the sola and are on slightly lower positions. The Crosby soils have gray sola and are on lower positions. The Cyclone and Treaty soils have a mollic epipedon and are in depressional areas. The well drained Miamian soils have thicker sola and are on similar positions."
