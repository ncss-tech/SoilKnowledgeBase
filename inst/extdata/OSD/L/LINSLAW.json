    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 55 degrees F. The depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. The thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 48 inches. Depth to aquic conditions with chroma of 2 or less with redox concentrations ranges from 10 to 20 inches. The pscs has 35 to 45 percent clay and 0 to 5 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It has weak or moderate granular and subangular blocky structure. Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon and BCt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 moist and 6 or 7 dry. It has faint to distinct iron depletions and distinct to prominent masses or iron accumulation. Texture is clay loam or clay with 35 to 45 percent clay. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has variegated colors with hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, 6 or 7 dry and chroma 1 to 6 moist and dry.  Texture in the upper part is clay and the lower part is sandy loam or sandy clay loam. Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Dupee, Santiam, and Zing series. Dupee lack the stratified, very firm clayey and sandy 2C horizon and have bedrock at 40 to more than 60 inches. Santiam soils have silty A and upper B horizons, and have 5 to 25 percent partially weathered gravel in the lower part of the B horizon and in the 2C horizon. Zing soils have an umbric epipedon, a neutral Bt horizon, and lack the very firm clayey and sandy 2C horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Linslaw soils are along drainageways dissecting old terraces and colluvial fans in the Willamette Valley at elevations of 250 to 800 feet. They have slopes of 0 to 8 percent. The soils formed in stratified loamy glaciolacustrine deposits and clayey mixed alluvium. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches. The mean January temperature is 39 to 40 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 65 to 67 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. The frost-period is 165 to 210 days."

Noti soils are poorly drained and dominantly have chroma of 2 or less throughout their profiles, and lack a Bt horizon. Noti soils occur in depressions on terraces. Salkum soils are well drained and lack mottles with chroma of 2 or less above a depth of 30 inches and are on higher convex terraces. Veneta soils lack redox features with chroma of 2 or less in the upper 30 inches of the profile, and occur on linear to concave terraces."

When Linslaw soils are in drainageways, they are subject to rare flooding. An apparent water table is at its uppermost level from December to April."
