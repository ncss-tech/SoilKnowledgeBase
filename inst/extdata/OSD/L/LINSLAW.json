  "OVERVIEW": "The Linslaw series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy glaciolacustrine deposits and clayey alluvium. These soils are along drainageways, on terraces and on colluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is 52 degrees F.",

It has weak or moderate granular and subangular blocky structure. Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon and BCt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 moist and 6 or 7 dry. It has faint to distinct iron depletions and distinct to prominent masses or iron accumulation. Texture is clay loam or clay with 35 to 45 percent clay.

The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches. The mean January temperature is 39 to 40 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 65 to 67 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. The frost-period is 165 to 210 days."

Noti soils are poorly drained and dominantly have chroma of 2 or less throughout their profiles, and lack a Bt horizon. Noti soils occur in depressions on terraces. Salkum soils are well drained and lack mottles with chroma of 2 or less above a depth of 30 inches and are on higher convex terraces. Veneta soils lack redox features with chroma of 2 or less in the upper 30 inches of the profile, and occur on linear to concave terraces."
