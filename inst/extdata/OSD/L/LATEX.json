Bernaldo, Bernow, Gallime, Naldo, Vesey, and Whakana soils do not have a clayey discontinuity in the lower part of the subsoil. In addition, Naldo, Vesey, and Whakana soils have mixed mineralogy, and Vesey and Whakana soils do not have a saturated zone within a depth of 80 inches. Freestone, Keithville, and Scottsville soils have aquic conditions within a depth of 30 inches. Keithville, Kolin, and Sawtown soils have a fine-silty control section.
