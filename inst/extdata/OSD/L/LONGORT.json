    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F.  Depth to densic materials is 25 to 40 inches.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the volcanic ash influence and depth to contrasting glacial till material is 10 to 17 inches, and has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.40 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent rock fragments and 8 to 15 percent clay.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is gravelly ashy sandy loam or very gravelly ashy sandy loam.  It has 15 to 25 percent gravel and 2 to 15 percent cobbles.\nThe 2C horizon hues of 2.5Y or 10YR, values of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam or very cobbly sandy loam.  It has 25 to 35 percent gravel and 10 to 20 percent cobbles.\nThe 3Cd horizons have hues of 2.5Y or 10YR, values of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chromas of 3 or 4 dry, 2 to 4 moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam or very cobbly sandy loam.  It has 30 to 45 percent gravel and 10 to 25 percent cobbles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Longort soils are on backslopes of mountains, usually on southerly aspects and have slopes of 15 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in glacial till and some colluvium from sedimentary rock with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  Elevations are 2,600 to 4,900 feet.  Precipitation ranges from 20 to 24 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 22 to 26 degrees F.; the average July temperature ranges from 62 to 67 degrees F.; and the average annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
