  "OVERVIEW": "The Longort series consists of moderately deep to densic material, well drained soils formed in glacial till and some colluvium from sedimentary rock with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  These soil are on backslopes of mountains usually with southerly aspects.  The average annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the volcanic ash influence and depth to contrasting glacial till material is 10 to 17 inches, and has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.40 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent rock fragments and 8 to 15 percent clay.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is gravelly ashy sandy loam or very gravelly ashy sandy loam.  It has 15 to 25 percent gravel and 2 to 15 percent cobbles.\nThe 2C horizon hues of 2.5Y or 10YR, values of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam or very cobbly sandy loam.  It has 25 to 35 percent gravel and 10 to 20 percent cobbles.\nThe 3Cd horizons have hues of 2.5Y or 10YR, values of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chromas of 3 or 4 dry, 2 to 4 moist.
