These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for 80 to 90 consecutive days during summer and fall. The particle-size control section averages 45 to 70 percent angular basalt fragments and 35 to 40 percent clay in the fine-earth fraction. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and includes all of the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5 YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist. Texture is very cobbly loam, very gravelly clay loam, very stony clay loam, very stony silt loam, or very stony loam.\nAn AB horizon is present in some pedons with color similar to the A horizon.  Texture is very cobbly silty clay loam, very cobbly clay loam, or very gravelly clay loam.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist. Texture is very cobbly clay loam, very cobbly clay or very gravelly clay loam. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt2 horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist. Texture is very cobbly clay, very gravelly clay, extremely cobbly clay loam, very cobbly clay loam or extremely cobbly clay loam. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline."
