  "STATUS": "Established Series",

  "REVDATE": "09/2007",
  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lemeta series consists of very poorly drained organic soils formed in sphagnum moss peat over fibrous sedge peat. The underlying tiers are permanently frozen. Lemeta soils are in fens on broad alluvial plains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 12 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Mean annual soil temperature is less than 32 degrees F. Depth to permafrost ranges from 14 to 24 inches. The thickness of organic materials is greater than 40 inches.\nThe upper 24 inches consists dominantly of sphagnum moss peat, though thin layers of sedge peat occur in some pedons. At greater depths the soil consists dominantly of either moss peat or sedge peat. Percent fiber after rubbing ranges from 90 to 100 percent in the moss peat and from 80 to 100 percent in the sedge peat. Woody pieces may occur at any depth.\nThe Oi horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value from 2 to 5; and chroma from 3 to 6. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe Oe and Oef horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma from 1 to 3. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid\nThe Oa horizons (when present) have hue of 7.5Y or 10YR; value from 1 to 3; and chroma from 1 to 3. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid."

The expanded control section now in use captures the increase in pH with depth and the series now classifies as euic.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
