  "OVERVIEW": "The Lakoma series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum weathered from clayey marine shale of the Pierre Shale Formation.  Lakoma soils are on dissected upland plains and hills.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 480 millimeters (19 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F).",
