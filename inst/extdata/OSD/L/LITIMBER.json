  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Hue below the A horizon is 5YR or 2.5YR. Depth to the Bk horizon ranges from 15 to 30 inches with horizons above the Bk horizon being calcareous or noncalcareous. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F. Average summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 64 degrees F. Average winter soil temperature ranges from 20 to 30 degrees F. The soils are usually moist, and they are dry in the upper part of the pedon for more than 90 cumulative days. The moist soil is frozen to depths as great as 60 inches for more than 90 consecutive days each year.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bw horizon has dry value of 4 or 5 in the upper part and 5 or 6 in the lower part, and chroma of 3 or 4. It has 35 to 50 percent clay. It has moderate fine to medium prismatic or blocky structure with ped coats being one unit of value less than the interior in the lower part of the horizon.\nThe Bk and BCk horizons have 5 to 14 percent CaC03 equivalent with an estimated 1 to 3 percent more CaC03 accumulated in the Bk horizon."
