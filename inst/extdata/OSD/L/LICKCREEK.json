  "OVERVIEW": "The Lickcreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and the underlying loamy and gravelly outwash. Lickcreek soils are on high flood-plain steps. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
