Hochheim, La Rose, Markesan, and Rotamer soils are less than 76 cm (30 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Linkville and Wea soils have less than 7 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section, where the substratum is within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Plattville soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Wyanet soils have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches)."

The soils formed in alluvium and in the underlying loamy and gravelly outwash in areas of Wisconsinan glaciation. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1092 mm (36 to 43 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 12.2 degrees C (48 to 54 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days. Elevation is 183 to 274 meters (600 to 899 feet) above mean sea level."
