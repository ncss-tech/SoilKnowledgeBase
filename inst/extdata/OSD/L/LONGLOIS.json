Dunbridge and Oneco soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 152 cm (60 inches). Falleaf, Lauramie, and Mohawk soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Lydick soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Pana soils are in areas where the mean annual temperature is greater than 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F). Razort soils do not have carbonates in the lower part of the series control section."

The soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of loess and in the underlying loamy and gravelly outwash. They are deep to calcareous, stratified sandy and gravelly outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 965 mm (35 to 38 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 11.1 degrees C (50 to 52 degrees F)."

The Bowes and Waupecan soils have less sand in the upper part of the control section, and are on less sloping areas. The somewhat poorly drained Lafayette soils are on toe slopes and in slight depressions. The very poorly drained Mahalasville soils are in drainageways and depressions. Where Mahalasville soils are mapped in association with Longlois soils, they have gravelly substrata."
