Kunayosh soils have O horizons composed of forest litter, 5GY hue in the C horizon, and precipitation greater than 80 inches.  Mysten soils are gravelly in the control section.  Skagway soils are somewhat poorly drained and are calcareous in the control section.  Teklanika soils have hue of 2.5Y in the C horizons and MAST less than 32 degrees.  Witefels soils have a paralithic contact between 20 to 40 inches.  Temo soils are in the sahllow family."
