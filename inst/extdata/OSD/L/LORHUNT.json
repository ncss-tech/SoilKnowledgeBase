  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  These soils have a soil moisture regime that is xeric bordering on aridic.  The particle size control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments, dominantly gravel and some cobbles and 18 to 27 percent clay. Rock fragments are sandstone, shale, and conglomerate with a few igneous surface rocks. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is 68 to 70 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is gravelly loam, very gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam, or extremely gravelly loam.  Reaction is moderately to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is very gravelly loam or extremely gravelly loam.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
