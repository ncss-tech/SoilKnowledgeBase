  "OVERVIEW": "The Lanver series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in eolian deposits over residuum weathered from sandstone and shale.  Lanver soils are on plateaus, structural benches and cuestas.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 47 degrees F.",

(Bkn and Bkny horizons)\nGypsum accumulation:  The presence of secondary gypsum in the zone from 31 to 36 inches.  (Bkny horizon)\nLithic contact:  The contact with sandstone bedrock at 36 inches.  (R layer)\nThe surface texture modifier was determined following the guidelines outlined in the Utah document, \"Procedures for Distributing Rock Fragments on the Surface Layer into the Upper 6 inches of Soil and Subsequent Naming of Map Units, April 1979.\"\nIn March 1996 the classification was changed from Ustic Haplocalcids to Sodic Ustic Haplocalcids.\nThe Lanver pedon used in the Henrys Fork Survey Area no longer fits the current concept of the Lanver series.  That pedon does not have sodium and gypsum accumulations.\nTaxonomic version:  Eleventh Edition, 2010."
