  "OVERVIEW": "The Lemitar series consists of very shallow or shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium from tuff or granite.  These soils are on hogbacks, cuestas and hills and have slopes ranging from 5 to 20 percent.  Average annual temperature is about 62 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is about 9 inches.",
