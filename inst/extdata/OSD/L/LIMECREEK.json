  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to carbonates typically coincide closely with the thickness of the loamy, erosional sediments at 20 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick unless eroded. A stone line that consists mainly of brachiopod fossils and cherty limestone fragments typically separate the loamy mantle and the underlying fossiliferous, siltstone and shaley limestone residuum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silty clay loam with a clay content ranging from 27 to 30 percent. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline. It contains 0 to 5 percent coarse fragments.\nThe AB or BA horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Some pedons have low chroma mottles in this horizon. The sand content of the A, AB, or BA horizon typically ranges from about 14 to 20 percent. It is dominantly fine or very fine sand.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. The clay content ranges from 22 to 30 percent and the sand content ranges from 18 to 40 percent. It is silty clay loam, loam or clay loam. It contains 0 to 10 percent coarse fragments. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 3C horizon typically has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. The percent of sand, silt, and clay is highly variable between horizons but the textures are silty clay loam to loam. The shaley limestone may have as much as 70 percent silt or sand or as little as 15 percent of either. The sand fraction typically is very fine and fine. Clay content ranges from 10 to 50 percent in subhorizons of the C. They average between 20 to 35 percent for all horizons of the C horizon above 60 inches. It contains 0 to 5 percent coarse fragments. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."

The Arbor, Aredale, Cresken, Garmore, Kenyon, Ostrander and Neeper(T) soils have carbonates and are more acid above 40 inches of the control section. The Bode, Clarion, Farrar, Frontenac, Ocheyedan, Moland and Rossfield soils do not have 2 chroma mottles above 24 inches and are more acid in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on nearly level and gently sloping ridge crests and on gently sloping and moderately sloping side slopes. They formed in 20 to 40 inches of loamy erosional sediments overlying stratified fossiliferous, siltstone and shaley limestone material. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 30 to 34 inches. Elevation ranges from 950 to 1,350 feet above mean sea level. Frost-free period ranges from 145 to 165 days."
