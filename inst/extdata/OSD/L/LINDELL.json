  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is greater than 5 feet. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through neutral in each horizon. Fragments range from 0 to 20 percent by volume in the A horizon, 0 to 15 percent in the B horizon, and 0 to 30 percent in the C horizon.  Fragments are dominantly chert.  The soil ranges from medium to high in phosphorous in each horizon.\nThe A and Ap horizon have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3 that is less than 7 inches thick.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is commonly silt loam, but includes loam and silty clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Few to common redoximorphic features with chroma 2 or less are within 24 inches of the soil surface.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, or clay loam\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Common to many redoximorphic features are in shades of gray and brown.  Some pedons are an evenly mottled pattern in these colors without a dominant color.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam or clay loam.  Some pedons have buried A and B horizons.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Common to many redoximorphic features  are in shades of gray, black, and brown.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Monacan is the only series in the same family.  Monacan soils have less than 5 percent coarse fragments in the control section and typically have a higher sand content.  Soils in closely related families are the Egam, Hamblen, Lindside, and Lynnville series.  Egam soils have mollic epipedons and fine-textured control sections.  Hamblen soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Lindside soils have a mesic soil temperature and fine-silty control sections.  Lynnville soils have mollic epipedons."

Slopes are mainly less than 1 percent but range up to about 3 percent along narrow drainageways.  Near the type location, mean annual temperature is 59.0 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 47.3 inches."

Egam soils have a mollic epipedon and have fine texture.  Sullivan soils are in similar positions on floodplains and are well drained.  Nolin soils are fine-silty.  The Armour soils, on adjacent or nearby terraces and footslopes, and the Mimosa, Stiversville, Hampshire, and Inman series are all on the uplands.  Armour, Mimosa, Stiversville, Hampshire and Inman soils have argillic horizons."
