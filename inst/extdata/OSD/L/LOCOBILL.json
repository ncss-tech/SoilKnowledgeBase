  "OVERVIEW": "The Locobill series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on hills and mountains.  These soils formed from granitic and metamorphic rocks.  Slopes range from 9 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches (38 cm), and the average annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.(12 degrees C.).",
