  "OVERVIEW": "The Longdrive series consists of very deep, poorly or very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks and volcanic ash.  Longdrive soils are on flood plains and toeslopes of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 2,200 to 2,900 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 410 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between the soil surface and 30 cm (very shallow or shallow free water occurrence classes) typically from November through June.  But some phases are saturated throughout most of the year. Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent.  These soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for brief periods between December and September. Non-flooded, ponded phases are also recognized."
