  "OVERVIEW": "The Leoncita series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils are on risers and treads of remnant paleoterraces. Slopes range from about 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).",

Leoncita soils formed from inland calcareous loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age associated with remnant paleoterraces.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in).  (Ap2, Bk1, Bk2 horizon)\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 in).  (Ap horizons)\nCalcic horizon: 40 to 160 cm (11 to 63 in).  (Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons)"
