  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The series was formerly included in the Hidalgo series.  The Hidalgo series parent material is associated with deltas and coastal terraces. The series was separated based on the source and age of the alluvium. Leoncita soils formed from inland calcareous loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age associated with remnant paleoterraces.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in).  (Ap2, Bk1, Bk2 horizon)\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 in).  (Ap horizons)\nCalcic horizon: 40 to 160 cm (11 to 63 in).  (Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Local lab data was run on particle-size analysis, calcium carbonate equivalent and pH were at the project office on S08TX3117106. The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from Live Oak County, Texas on soils derived from similar sediments.\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
