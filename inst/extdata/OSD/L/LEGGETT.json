  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  The combined thickness of the A and E horizons ranges from 10 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 7, and chroma from 1 or 2.  When value is less than 3.5, the thickness is less than 7 inches.  Mottles range from none to common in shades of brown, gray, or yellow.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Mottles range from few to many.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.  Texture of the A and E horizon is typically fine sandy loam but includes loam and very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt/E horizon is mainly hue of 10YR through 5Y, value from 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Bt/E horizon has these colors and many brownish or yellowish mottles or include chroma of 3 to 6 with mottles of gray.  Texture is sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Some pedons have sandy clay strata below a depth of 40 inches.  Mottles range from few to many in shades of red, brown, yellow, and gray.  Tongues of albic materials extend to depths of 50 inches or more.  The tongues and interfingerings consist of vertical streaks and masses of albic materials 5 mm to about 30 mm wide and the percentage increases with depth and make up 15 to 30 percent of some subhorizon.  Strongly cemented concretions of iron up to 1/2 inch in diameter range from none to common.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are not competing series in the same family.  Other similar soils are Alazan, Aldine, Bissonnet, Colita, Gessner, Mollville, Rains, and Waller series.  Alazan soils lack a matrix with chroma of 2 or less.  Aldine and Bissonnet series are in a fine-silty family.  Colita, Gessner, Mollville, and Waller series have grayer colors throughout.  Rains soils have base saturation of less than 35 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Leggett soils are on nearly level flats and on gently sloping concave areas at the head of the drains.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The soil formed from loamy Coastal Plain sediments, mainly of the Willis, Fleming, and Catahoula geologic formations.  The climate is warm and humid.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 70 degrees F., and the Thornthwaite annual P-E index exceeds 64."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Colita and Waller series and the Choates, Doucette, Pinetucky, Pluck, Wiergate, and Woodville series.  Colita soils are on nearly slightly higher areas and have a paralithic contact within 60 inches.  Doucette, Pinetucky, and Woodville soils are on higher more sloping landscapes and are dominated by yellowish brownish and reddish colors.  Choates soils are on similar positions, have thick sandy epipedons, and have argillic horizons that are brownish and yellowish.  Pluck soils are on floodplains.  Wiergate soils are clayey throughout, are calcareous, and are on nearly convex landscapes."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Leggett soils are used mainly for forest and improved pasture.  Pasture is mainly bermudagrass or bahiagrass.  Forest consists of loblolly and shortleaf pines, sweetgum, red oak, and hickory with an understory of dogwood and holly trees and a few native grasses."
