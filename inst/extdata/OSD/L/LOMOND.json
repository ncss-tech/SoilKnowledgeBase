  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to hard limestone bedrock and thickness of solum range from 5 to 8 feet or more.  Depth to the IIB horizon, which commonly is the same as the thickness of loess and alluvium, ranges from 40 to 70 inches.  The soil is dominantly strongly acid, but ranges to slight acid.   The amount of weatherable minerals in the silt and sand fraction ranges from about 2 to 10 percent. Coarse fragment range from 0 to 5 percent in the A and B horizons and 0 to 10 in the 2B horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is mostly silt loam, but is also silty clay loam in some severely eroded areas.\nSome pedons have AB or BA horizons that are transitional in color and texture to the A and B horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 and chroma of 4 to 8 or hue of 2.5YR, value of 3 and chroma of 6.  It is mostly silty clay loam, but ranges to silt loam in the upper part and to silty clay or clay in the lower part.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 and chroma of 4 to 8 or hue of 5YR, value of 5 and chroma of 6.  Mottles are in shades of brown, red and gray.  This horizon is silty clay or clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Lomond is the only soil in this family.  Soils in closely related families are the Crider, Etowah, and Pembroke series.  Crider and Pembroke soils have temperatures less than 59 degrees F., and the amount of weatherable minerals in the silt and sand fractions exceeds 10 percent.  Etowah soils have less than 35 percent base saturation at 50 inches below the top of the B horizon and more than 15 percent fine and coarser sand in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The landscape on which Lomond soils are located is marked by occasional outcrops of limestone and by sinks and depressions.  At the type location, mean annual air temperature is 59 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 50 inches."
