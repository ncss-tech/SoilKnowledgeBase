Organic carbon in the upper 40 centimeters averages 0.6 to 1.5 percent.  The particle-size control section is clay, silty clay, or clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay and less than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  Hue is 10YR or 2.5Y, value is 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma is 2 to 4.\nThe A horizon has an EC of less than 2 mmhos.\nThe cambic horizon (Bw) is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.\nThe gypsic horizon (By) has 10 to 30 percent gypsum.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  EC is less than 4 mmhos.\nThe C horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  EC ranges from 2 to 8 mmhos."
