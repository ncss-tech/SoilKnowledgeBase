  "OVERVIEW": "The Lonebear series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly\npermeable soils on hillsides.  They formed in slopewash alluvium and residuum derived from gypsiferous shale.  Slopes range from 3 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
