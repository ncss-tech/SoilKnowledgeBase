  "OVERVIEW": "The Latierra series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist.  Latierra soils are on toeslopes of eroded fan remnants.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
