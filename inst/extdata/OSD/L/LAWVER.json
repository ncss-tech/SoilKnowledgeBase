    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 16 to 27 inches.  Depth to continuous accumulations of calcium carbonate ranges from 12 to 22 inches.  Depth to material with more than 50 percent porcelanite ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F., which occurs about April 22-28, and is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days between July 1 and October 25 and for at least 90 cumulative days during this period.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Textures are clay loam or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  It averages 5 to 15 percent porcelanite channers, but some subhorizons may have up to 25 percent channers.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Textures are clay loam or clay with 35 to 45 percent clay, and are modified by 5 to 25 percent porcelanite channers.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 4 to 12 percent.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Textures are typically very channery loam or very channery clay loam, but may include channery loam or channery clay loam.  It has 25 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 50 percent porcelanite channers, and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 4 to 12 percent.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The fine-earth fraction typically is sandy loam.  The horizon has 50 to 95 percent porcelanite fragments, of which 50 to 65 percent are channers, 10 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline."

They formed in alluvium or loess over weathered porcelanite or very channery slopewash derived from porcelanite.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 3,800 to 5,300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 17 inches, half of which falls as rain or snow from late March through June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."
