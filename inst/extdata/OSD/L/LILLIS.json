XERERT SUBORDER\n6.1  The soil temperature exceeds 47 degrees F, from Jan. to Dec. (365 days).  Within this time period cracks are closed for 100 to 151 consecutive days.\n6.2  Cracks are open from May thru November.\nThe moisture control section data are as follows:\nJ   F   M   A   M   J   J   A   S   O   N   D\nMONTHS:   |...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|\nCRACKS    |...|...|...|...|<-------214 DAYS---------->|...|\nOPEN\nCRACKS      ----151 DAYS-->|...........................|<--\nCLOSED\nEXCEEDS 41\nDEGREES F. |<---------------------------365 DAYS---------->|\nEXCEEDS 47\nDEGREES F. |<----------------------------365 DAYS--------->|\n7. 7.
