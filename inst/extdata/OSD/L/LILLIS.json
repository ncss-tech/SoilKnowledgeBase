OCHRIC EPIPEDON--0 to 13 inches (Apl, Ap2, Bnssz).\n1.1  Moist colors have values greater than 3.5.\n1.  VERTISOL FEATURES\n1.1  Unless irrigated, vertical cracks extend from the surface and range from 0.5 to 2 inches wide at a depth of 20 inches.\n1.2  The typical pedon, which was cultivated and irrigated, had cracks to a depth of 21 inches. They ranged in size from 4 cm to 1 mm. Intersecting slickensides occur between the depths of 7 and 21 inches in the typical pedon.\n1.3  The cracks usually close from December thru April for 100 to 150 consecutive days\n1.4 COLE values range from 0.12 to 0.20 cm/cm in the typical pedon.\n2.

SMECTITIC MINERALOGY\n3.1  NSSL results show a predominance of smectite.  Cracking and very-fine particle-size class are further evidence of the mineralogy.\n4.  THERMIC TEMPERATURE REGIME\n4.1  Soil temperature regime is assumed to be thermic based upon data from Helm, CA (about 20 miles SE of typical site).\n4.2  Based on two of our soil temperature sites 18 and 24 miles SE of the typical site with 3 years of quarterly data.  Soil temperature is 62 to 65 degrees F.\n5.  PRECIPITATION\n5.1  MAP is about 8 inches based upon data from Mendota Dam, CA (about 10 miles N of the typical pedon).\n6.  XERERT SUBORDER\n6.1  The soil temperature exceeds 47 degrees F, from Jan. to Dec. (365 days).  Within this time period cracks are closed for 100 to 151 consecutive days.\n6.2  Cracks are open from May thru November.\nThe moisture control section data are as follows:\nJ   F   M   A   M   J   J   A   S   O   N   D\nMONTHS:   |...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|\nCRACKS    |...|...|...|...|<-------214 DAYS---------->|...|\nOPEN\nCRACKS      ----151 DAYS-->|...........................|<--\nCLOSED\nEXCEEDS 41\nDEGREES F. |<---------------------------365 DAYS---------->|\nEXCEEDS 47\nDEGREES F. |<----------------------------365 DAYS--------->|\n7. 7.
