  "OVERVIEW": "The Larry series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains, flood-plain steps, drainageways, and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 4.4 degrees C.",
