  "REVDATE": "10/2002",
  "STATES": "UT,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ledgefork series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from quartzite and sandstone.  Ledgefork soils are on mountain slopes and have gradients of 25 to 70 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 28 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F., and the mean summer air temperature is about 58 degrees F.",

Some stones occur on the surface in some places. Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR. The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 55 to 59 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2. It ranges from very gravelly loamy fine sand to very gravelly sandy loam or stony loamy fine sand, and has 35 to 60 percent rock fragments. This horizon is neutral or slightly acid, and is 6 to 16 inches thick.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4. It ranges from very gravelly or very cobbly loamy fine sand to very gravel or very cobbly fine sand, and has 60 to 90 percent rock fragments. This horizon is neutral or slightly acid."
