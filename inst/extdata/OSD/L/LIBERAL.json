  "STATES": "MO,OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Liberal series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in residuum from shale of Pennsylvanian age and lenses of sandstone or siltstone. These soils are on upland ridgetops and mounds.  Slope ranges from 2 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1070 mm (42 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).",
