    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Liberal soils are on upland ridgetops.  Slope ranges from 2 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in residuum from shale Pennsylvanian age with lenses of sandstone or siltstone.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 1140 mm (35 to 45 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 15 to 17 degrees C (59 to 62 degrees F)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Barden soils and the Barco, Bates, Collinsville, and Parsons soils. Barden soils are very deep and are on less sloping positions.  Barco and Bates soils are fine-loamy and are moderately deep over sandstone and are on similar positions.  Collinsville soils are less than 50 cm (20 inches) to bedrock and are on similar positions.  Parsons soils have an abrupt textural change, are very deep and are on higher more level positions."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained.  Potential for surface runoff is medium to rapid.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.4 to 14 micrometers per second) in the upper part and moderately low (0.4 to 1.4 micrometers per second) in the lower part.  Permeability is slow.  In undisturbed areas, a perched water table has an upper limit of 60 to 90 cm (2.0 to 3.0 feet) during November to March in most years."
