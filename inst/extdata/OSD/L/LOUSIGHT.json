  "OVERVIEW": "The Lousight series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources with a strong granitic influence. Lousight soils are on alluvial fans. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
