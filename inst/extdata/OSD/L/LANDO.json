  "OVERVIEW": "The Lando series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Lando soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

The soil is not classified in the aquic subgroup of Calcixerolls because the pedon lacks redox concentrations within 75 centimeters of the mineral soil surface.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
