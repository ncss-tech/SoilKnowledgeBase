    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 33 inches (Ap, AB, Bk1, and Bk2 horizons).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 14 to 60 inches (Bk1, Bk2, Bkg1, and Bkg2 horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 24 and 48 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the Bk2 and Bkg1 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons and parts of the AB and Bkg1 horizons).\nThe cation exchange activity class is an estimate based on soil properties in NASIS data elements.  The soil is not classified in the aquic subgroup of Calcixerolls because the pedon lacks redox concentrations within 75 centimeters of the mineral soil surface.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
