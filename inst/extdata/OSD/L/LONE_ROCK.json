  "OVERVIEW": "The Lone Rock series consists of very deep, well to somewhat excessively drained soils formed in alluvium derived from granite, micaceous schist, and other igneous rocks.  Lone Rock soils are on fans and terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
