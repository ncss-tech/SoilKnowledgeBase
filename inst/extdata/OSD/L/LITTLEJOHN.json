The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  Subhorizon with value and chroma of 3 are less than 7 inches thick.  The A horizon contains more than 60 percent volcanic ash.  It is strongly acid or moderately acid.  Some pedons have an E horizon 1 to 2 inches thick.\nThe 2Bw1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.
