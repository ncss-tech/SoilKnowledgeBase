  "OVERVIEW": "The Lilcan series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or slope alluvium over residuum derived from limestone, dolomite, or sandstone.  Lilcan soils are on hillslopes, mountain slopes and summits. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
