  "OVERVIEW": "The Leon series consists of very deep, very poorly and poorly drained, moderately rapid to moderately slowly permeable soils on upland flats, depressions, stream terraces and tidal areas. They formed in sandy marine sediments of the Eastern Gulf Coast Flatwoods (MLRA 152A), the Atlantic Coast Flatwoods (MLRA 153A) and to a lesser extent in the Southern Coastal Plain (MLRA 133A) and the North-Central Florida Ridge (MLRA 138).  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 65 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",

Allanton, Hurricane and Pottsburg soils have a spodic horizon at depths greater than 50 inches.  In addition, Allanton soils are on lower positions and have umbric epipedons, Hurricane soils are somewhat poorly drained and on higher positions and Pottsburg soils are somewhat poorly to poorly drained and on similar to slightly higher positions.  Chaires, Mascotte, Olustee and Sapelo soils are on similar positions but are underlain by argillic horizons under the Bh horizon. Chipley, Foxworth, Kershaw, Lakeland, Ortega and Ridgewood soils are on higher positions and lack spodic horizons.  In addition, Chipley and Ridgewood soils are somewhat poorly drained, Foxworth soils are moderately well drained to excessively drained, Kershaw, Kureb and Lakeland soils are excessively drained and Ortega soils are moderately well drained.  The very poorly drained Croatan, Dorovan and Pamlico soils are on lower positions and are organic.  Lynn Haven soils are on similar positions but have an umbric epipedon.  The somewhat poorly drained Mandarin soils are on higher positions.  Osier soils are on flood plains and lack spodic horizons.  The somewhat poorly to moderately well drained Pactolus soils are on higher positions and lack spodic horizons.  The very poorly drained Pantego, Pickney, Portsmouth, Rutlege and Surrency soils are on lower positions and lack spodic horizons.
