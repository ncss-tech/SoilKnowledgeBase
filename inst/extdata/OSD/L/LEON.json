Allanton, Hurricane and Pottsburg soils have a spodic horizon at depths greater than 50 inches.  In addition, Allanton soils are on lower positions and have umbric epipedons, Hurricane soils are somewhat poorly drained and on higher positions and Pottsburg soils are somewhat poorly to poorly drained and on similar to slightly higher positions.  Chaires, Mascotte, Olustee and Sapelo soils are on similar positions but are underlain by argillic horizons under the Bh horizon. Chipley, Foxworth, Kershaw, Lakeland, Ortega and Ridgewood soils are on higher positions and lack spodic horizons.  In addition, Chipley and Ridgewood soils are somewhat poorly drained, Foxworth soils are moderately well drained to excessively drained, Kershaw, Kureb and Lakeland soils are excessively drained and Ortega soils are moderately well drained.  The very poorly drained Croatan, Dorovan and Pamlico soils are on lower positions and are organic.  Lynn Haven soils are on similar positions but have an umbric epipedon.  The somewhat poorly drained Mandarin soils are on higher positions.  Osier soils are on flood plains and lack spodic horizons.  The somewhat poorly to moderately well drained Pactolus soils are on higher positions and lack spodic horizons.  The very poorly drained Pantego, Pickney, Portsmouth, Rutlege and Surrency soils are on lower positions and lack spodic horizons.  In addition, Pantego, Pickney, Rutlege and Surrency soils have umbric epipedons.  Plummer soils are on similar to lower positions and are grossarenic.  Ridgeland and Wesconnett soils and lack E horizons between the A and Bh horizons.  In addition, Ridgeland soils are on slightly higher positions and are somewhat poorly drained while Wesconnett soils are in lower depressional areas and are very poorly drained.  The moderately well drained Resota soils are in higher positions and have weakly expressed spodic horizons.  The poorly drained Scranton soils are on similar to slighter higher positions and lack spodic horizons."
