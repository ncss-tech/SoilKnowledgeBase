  "OVERVIEW": "The Leidig series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from granitoid rock and reworked lake sediments. These soils are on relict point bars, distinct bars and channels, hung channels, high floodplains, meander scars in mountain valleys. Slope is 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches (940 millimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F (11.7 degrees C).",

Encroachment of woodland species, particularly, Ponderosa pine and incense cedar, increases the rate of summer drawdown so that an anaerobic hydrology is supplanted by and aerobic hydrology culminating in the development of an open canopy woodland plant community with an understory of grasses and forbs. The extent of soil water aerations also influenced by the lateral subsoil flow of aerated water into the flood plain soil from both up-valley and side-valley sources."
