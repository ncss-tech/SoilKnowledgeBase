    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife, and watershed. This soil is capable of supporting both meadow and woodland plant communities. Encroachment of woodland species, particularly, Ponderosa pine and incense cedar, increases the rate of summer drawdown so that an anaerobic hydrology is supplanted by and aerobic hydrology culminating in the development of an open canopy woodland plant community with an understory of grasses and forbs. The extent of soil water aerations also influenced by the lateral subsoil flow of aerated water into the flood plain soil from both up-valley and side-valley sources."
