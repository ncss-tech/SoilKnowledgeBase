Coolidge soils are sandy loam in the particle size control section. Aco and Garywash are moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative between July and September and have secondary accumulations of silica and gypsum in the control section. Rillito soils have 15 to 35 percent gravel. Toltec soils have a calcic horizon that consists of a disintegrated hardpan."

The climate is arid with extremely hot summers and mild winters.  The average annual precipitation is 3 to 10 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 69 to 76 degrees F.
