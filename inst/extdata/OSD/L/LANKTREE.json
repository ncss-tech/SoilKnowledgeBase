  "OVERVIEW": "The Lanktree series consists of very deep, well drained soils on high terraces.  They formed in alluvium dominantly from intermediate intrusive rocks.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
