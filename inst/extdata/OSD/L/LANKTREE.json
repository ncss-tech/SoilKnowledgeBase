The soils formed in the Idaho geologic formation consisting chiefly of unconsolidated sands, gravel or cobbles derived from granite or related igneous rocks.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, including 1.5 to 3 feet of snowfall and the average annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 115 to 150 days."
