Slopes are 0 to 10 percent. The soils formed in eolian material or alluvium derived from mixed igneous and sedimentary rocks and lacustrine deposits. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F., the average annual precipitation is 4 to 8 inches. The average freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days."
