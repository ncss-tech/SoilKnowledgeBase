  "BYREV": "Rev. SMB/TAD/MJD",
  "REVDATE": "12/2007",
  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lynndyl series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian material or alluvium derived from mixed igneous and sedimentary rocks and lacustrine deposits.  These soils occur on fan skirts, beach bars, lake terraces and the alluvial lake plain of ancient Lake Bonneville. Slopes are 0 to 10 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
