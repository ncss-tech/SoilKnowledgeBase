  "OVERVIEW": "The Leetonia series consists of deep and very deep, well to excessively drained soils formed in residuum from sandstone, conglomerate and quartzite.  They are sloping to moderately steep soils on ridge tops and side slopes on mountains, ridges, and dissected plateaus. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1220 mm (48 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 10.5 C (51 degrees F).",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 43 to 107 centimeters.  Depth to bedrock is 100 centimeters or more.  Coarse fragments of quartzite or sandstone range from 35 to 65 percent by volume in the control section.  These soils are gravelly or very gravelly sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand throughout with sand coarser than very fine sand ranging from 60 to 80 percent and medium and fine sand being dominant.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to very strongly acid in all horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, values of 2 through 4 and chromas of 0 to 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 10 YR with values of 5 or 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has weak platy structure in some pedons and has an irregular lower boundary in a few pedons.\nThe Bh, Bhs, or Bs horizons have hues of 10YR through 2.5YR with values of 2 through 4 and chromas of 2 through 6.  Consistence ranges to slightly sticky when wet due to high content of organic matter.  Structure ranges from weak granular to weak blocky.  The lower 2 to 7 centimeters of the Bhs horizon can be slightly brittle or intermittently very weakly cemented in some pedons.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon 10 to 40 centimeters thick with hues of 7.5YR through 10YR, values of 5 or 6 and chromas of 4 through 6.\nThe BC horizon has hues of 7.5YR through 10YR with values of 5 or 6 and chromas of 4 through 6.\nThe C horizon has hues of 7.5YR or yellower with values of 5 through 7 and chromas of 2 through 6."

The Avery, Canaan, Colosse, Gloucester, Hinckley, Manchester, Quonset, Shapleigh, Trout River and Warwick series are in closely related families.  Avery soils have an argillic horizon below the spodic horizon and contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Canaan and Shapleigh soils have bedrock within 20 inches of the surface, in addition, Canaan soils have frigid soil temperatures.  The Colosse and Trout River soils have frigid soil temperatures and mixed mineralogy.  The Gloucester, Hinckley, Manchester, Quonset, and Warwick soils lack spodic horizons and have mixed mineralogy."

They formed in highly siliceous materials, with low base status, weathered mainly from sandstones, conglomerates and quartzites.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 8.3 to 12.7 C (47 to 55 degrees F).  Average annual precipitation ranges from 810 to 1300 millimeters.  The average frost-free ranges from 150 to 180 days."
