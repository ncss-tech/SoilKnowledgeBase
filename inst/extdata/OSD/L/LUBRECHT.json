  "BYREV": "Rev. NRS-CNG-JAL",
  "REVDATE": "11/2001",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lubrecht series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or residuum derived mainly from semiconsolidated Tertiary Age siltstone or shale.  These soils are on stream terraces and hills in mountain valleys.  Slopes are 4 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
