  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The organic layers are greater than 51 inches thick.  Woody fragments comprising up to 30 percent of the volume in some pedons are mixed throughout the control section in the form of twigs, branches, logs, or stumps.  The control section typically has pH of 6.6 to 7.8 in 0.01M calcium chloride but ranges from 4.5 to 7.8. The surface tier has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 3 or are neutral.  Surface tier commonly is sapric material, but some pedons are hemic or consist of various proportions of hemic and sapric material.  This tier has a weak to medium, coarse to very fine granular structure.  Some pedons have up to 4 inches of fibric material on the surface.\nThe subsurface and lower tier has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 3 or are neutral.  Chroma or value or both may change 0.5 to 1 unit when rubbed or pressed.  The subsurface tier primarily is sapric material.  Some pedons contain layers of hemic material within the subsurface and bottom tiers but their combined thickness is less than 10 inches.  A few thin layers of fibric material are also in the bottom two tiers of some pedons but their combined thickness is less than 5 inches.  The upper part of the subsurface tier typically has a weak to moderate, fine to coarse granular structure; however, some pedons are massive or coarse blocky that parts to a granular or fine to medium subangular blocky structure.  The lower portion of the subsurface tier commonly is either massive or has thick platy structure consisting primarily of herbaceous fibers.  In some pedons, where the lower part of the tier is comprised of woody materials, the structure is similar to that in the upper part.  The aggregated material in the subsurface tier breaks abruptly under pressure between the fingers.  The unrubbed, well decomposed sapric material resembles woody tissue.  The bottom tier has variable amounts of woody and herbaceous fiber.  The structure is commonly massive or thick platy."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bucksport, Pywell, Seelyeville, and Tendoy series.  Bucksport soils typically do not have genetically developed structure in the profile and are in areas receiving more than 34 inches of annual precipitation.  Pywell soils have layers of volcanic ash in the profile. Tendoy and Seelyeville soils do not have woody fibers and/or fragments throughout the control section. In addition, the Tendoy soils have free carbonates in the upper part of the surface tier"

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lupton soils are in depressions within lake plains, till plains, outwash plains, and moraines.  These depressions vary from small enclosed ones to those of several thousand acres in extent.  Lupton soils have normally been influenced by ground water passing through surrounding mineral soil materials that are high in minerals.  Slopes typically range from 0 to 2 percent, but range to 15 percent.  Minor deposits above 2 percent are on foot slopes as the upland soils break sharply into depressional or flood plain areas.  These minor deposits are typically associated with groundwater discharge or seep areas.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 34 inches; and the mean annual temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F. Frost free days range from 88 to 150. Elevation above sea level ranges from 670 to 1,600 feet."

The representative depth of ponding is from .2 to 1.0 foot at some time throughout the year.  Surface runoff is negligible to high, dependent on slope. Permeability is moderately slow to moderately rapid."

Major forest vegetation includes alder, balsam fir, black ash, black spruce, American elm, red maple, tamarack, white birch, white cedar, willow, and yellow birch."
