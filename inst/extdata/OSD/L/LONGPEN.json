These soils formed in loess colluvium weathered from basalt with an admixture of volcanic ash. Elevation is 1,100 to 3,400 feet. The average annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F. The average annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 40 inches and the frost free season is 80 to 125 days."

The slowly permeable lower part of the soil causes lateral subsurface flow.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 9 inches (Oi, A1 and A2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 9 to 71 inches (BtA, Bt1, Bt2, BE, 2Btb1, and 2Btb2 horizons).\nParticle size control section - The zone from 9 to 29 inches (BtA, Bt1 and part of the Bt2 horizon).\nThe ranges listed under the A horizons for volcanic glass content and acid-oxalate extractable Fe + 1/2 Fe are estimates only.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Partial laboratory data is available for another pedon of Longpen.
