  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Longpen series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess over colluvium weathered from basalt with an admixture of volcanic ash on the surface. Longpen soils are on canyon sides and structural benches and have slopes of 5 to 50 percent. Permeability is slow. The average annual precipitation is about 32 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The slowly permeable lower part of the soil causes lateral subsurface flow.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 9 inches (Oi, A1 and A2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 9 to 71 inches (BtA, Bt1, Bt2, BE, 2Btb1, and 2Btb2 horizons).\nParticle size control section - The zone from 9 to 29 inches (BtA, Bt1 and part of the Bt2 horizon).\nThe ranges listed under the A horizons for volcanic glass content and acid-oxalate extractable Fe + 1/2 Fe are estimates only.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Partial laboratory data is available for another pedon of Longpen.
