  "OVERVIEW": "The Longpen series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess over colluvium weathered from basalt with an admixture of volcanic ash on the surface. Longpen soils are on canyon sides and structural benches and have slopes of 5 to 50 percent. Permeability is slow. The average annual precipitation is about 32 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
