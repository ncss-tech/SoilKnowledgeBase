  "OVERVIEW": "The Lasvar series consists of moderately deep to hardpan, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium from extrusive igneous rock.  Lasvar soils are in basins and drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
