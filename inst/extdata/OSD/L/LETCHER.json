  "OVERVIEW": "The Letcher series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly or moderately well drained soils formed in glacial outwash sediments and in loamy glacial till on uplands. Permeability is slow in the solum and moderate or moderately rapid in the underlying material.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Cathay soils do not have columnar structure and have a fine-loamy control section.  Desart, Ekalaka, and Noonan soils have A horizons with chroma greater than 1.5.  In addition, the Desart soils have combined A and E horizons thicker than 20 inches and are well drained.  Larson, Miranda, Noonan, and Sorum soils have a fine-loamy control section. Lemert soils have a combined thickness of A and E horizons less than 5 inches and have visible salt or gypsum crystals within a depth of 16 inches.  Stirum soils have an aquic soil moisture regime.  Whitelake soils have a warmer soil temperature regime."
