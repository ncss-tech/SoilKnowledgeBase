    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free carbonates ranges from 10 to 25 inches.  Buried horizons of loam or sandy loam are in most pedons and are typically below 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.5 or 1.  Typically it is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam but is loamy sand and loamy fine sand in some pedons.  It is strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  It is lacking in some pedons when plowed.  It ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam averaging less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  It has strong or moderate, coarse or very coarse, columnar structure in the upper part, but is prismatic when the upper part is disturbed by plowing.  It typically has accumulations of carbonates and salts in the lower part.  It ranges from neutral to strongly alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or loamy sand.  Some pedons do not have accumulations of carbonates and some pedons have accumulations of salt.  It ranges from slightly to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons do not have a BC horizon.\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist; and chroma of 1 to 4.  Typically it is sandy loam or fine sandy loam but is loam or loamy fine sand in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly to strongly alkaline.  The C horizon typically has common or many mottles.  Clay loam glacial till or loamy and clayey lacustrine sediments are at depths between 40 and 60 inches in some pedons."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Other similar soils are Cathay, Desart, Ekalaka, Larson, Lemert, Miranda, Noonan, Sorum, Stirum, and Whitelake soils.  Cathay soils do not have columnar structure and have a fine-loamy control section.  Desart, Ekalaka, and Noonan soils have A horizons with chroma greater than 1.5.  In addition, the Desart soils have combined A and E horizons thicker than 20 inches and are well drained.  Larson, Miranda, Noonan, and Sorum soils have a fine-loamy control section. Lemert soils have a combined thickness of A and E horizons less than 5 inches and have visible salt or gypsum crystals within a depth of 16 inches.  Stirum soils have an aquic soil moisture regime.  Whitelake soils have a warmer soil temperature regime."

Surfaces are plain or slightly hummocky, and slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent.  The soil formed in sandy and loamy glacial outwash materials and in loamy glacial till. Mean annual temperature ranges from 34 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 21 inches.  Growing season is about 120 to 130 days; average growing season precipitation from 13 to 18 inches; and growing degree days are about 2600 to 3000."

Lemert soils are in slight depressions and swales.  Miranda soils are on similar landscapes and are in the lows of the microrelief.  Parshall soils do not have a natric horizon and are on convex positions above the Letcher soils."
