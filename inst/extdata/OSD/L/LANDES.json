  "OVERVIEW": "The Landes series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly and rapidly permeable soils on flood plains.  These soils formed in loamy and sandy alluvium.  Slope ranges from 0 to 7 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11.7 degrees C (53 degrees F).",

These soils formed in loamy and sandy alluvium of recent origin that is stratified with subtle differences in texture or organic carbon content.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 13.9 degrees C (45 to 57 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1143 mm (27 to 45 inches), frost free days range from 140 to 210 days, and elevation ranges form 104 to 311 meters (340 feet to 1,020 feet) above mean sea level."

Beaucoup, Darwin, Tice, and Titus soils average more than 18 percent clay and less than 50 percent sand in the control section.  The poorly drained and very poorly drained Beaucoup and Darwin soils and the poorly drained Titus soils are commonly in old channel beds adjacent to Landes soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Tice soils are in similar, but generally lower positions on the flood plain.  The well drained Genesee soils average more than 18 percent clay in the control section and are in similar positions on the flood plain.  The somewhat poorly drained Riley soils average more than 18 percent clay in the upper part of the control section and are in similar, but generally lower positions on the flood plain nearby."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high (14.11 to 42.34 micrometers per second) in the upper and middle parts of the series control section and high to very high (42.34 to 141.14 micrometers per second) in the lower part. Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper and middle parts of the series control section and rapid in the lower part. Flooding from stream overflow is common during the late winter and early spring.  A moderately wet phase is recognized that has a seasonal high water table at a depth 122 to 183 cm (4 to 6 feet) at some time between March and May in most years."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Some of the soils correlated in the past as Landes probably are Entisols.  The current series concept includes a wide variety of USDA textures, but much of the variability is related to size of the sand fraction.  The sands and loamy sands contain a sufficient amount of very fine sand to place them in the coarse-loamy taxonomic family.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 48 cm (19 inches) (Ap, A, and AB horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from 48 to 81 cm (19 to 32 inches) (Bw1, Bw2, and Bw3 horizons)."
