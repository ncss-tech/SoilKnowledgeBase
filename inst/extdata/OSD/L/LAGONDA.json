  "OVERVIEW": "The Lagonda series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loess and pedisediment or loess, pedisediment and a paleosol formed in glacial till. These soils are on ridgetops and side slopes ranging from 2 to 14 percent slope. Mean annual temperature is 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 36 inches.",

The particle size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon, if present has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 3 or 4. The Btg horizon has hue 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2Btg horizon is quite variable in dominant color; hue ranges from 10YR to 5Y.

Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 3Btgb horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is clay loam or clay. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nCOMPETING SERIES  These are the Adair, Arispe, Chase, Flanagan, Greenton, Grundy, Herrick, Ipava, Keller, Lamoni, Macksburg, Mahaska, Malvern, Martin, Mayberry, Pawnee, Rutland, Seymour, Shorewood, and Wymore soils. Adair soils contain more sand and more red mottles in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Arispe soils have less sand in the lower part of the solum. The Chase soils have mollic epipedons greater than 36 inches thick. Flanagan soils have less clay in the lower part of the solum. Greenton soils have color of higher chroma in the matrix of the argillic horizon and have formed in residuum from shale. Grundy, Ipava, Macksburg, Mahaska and Seymour soils contain less than 5 percent sand throughout their sola and formed in thick loess. Herrick soils have E horizons and contain less sand in the lower part of the sola. The Lamoni soils have more sand and contain pebbles in the upper part of the B horizon. Malvern soils have redder hue or redder mottles in the upper part of the B horizon. Martin soils have mollic epipedons more than 24 inches thick. Mayberry soils have redder hue in the B horizon. Pawnee soils contain more sand in the upper part of the sola and are drier in the soil moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice. Rutland soils do not have pebbles and have less sand in the lower part of the solum. Shorewood soils formed in clayey lacustrine material and have a lower sand content. Wymore soils have less sand and do not have pebbles throughout the solum."

They formed in 20 to 36 inches of loess or silty material underlain by pedisediment which is presumed to have washed from glacial till. This often is underlain by a paleosol in glacial till. The mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 40 inches."

Sampsel soils are wetter and contain less sand in the lower part of the sola. They may be on both higher or lower landscape positions."
