  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Libertybutte series consists of shallow, well drained soils on mountains and hills. They formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from argillite, siltite and fine grained quartzite of the Wallace, Libby and Striped Peak formations of the Belt Supergroup with an influence of loess. Slope ranges from 5 to 30 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 23 inches.",
