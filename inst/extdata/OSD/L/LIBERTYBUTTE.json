Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived predominantly from metasedimentary bedrock with an influence of loess. Elevations range from 2,800 to 3,700 feet. The average annual air temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 20 to 25 inches.  The average frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."
