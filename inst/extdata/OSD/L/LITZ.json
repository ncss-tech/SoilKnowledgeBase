  "REVDATE": "07/2003",
  "STATES": "KY,MD,PA,TN,VA,WV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Litz series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum from leached calcareous shale and with widely spaced thin layers of limestone. These soils are found on upland ridges and sideslopes mainly in the Ridge and Valley areas of the Appalachians. Permeability is moderate. Slopes range from 2 to 80 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 10 to 30 inches. Depth to lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Many pedons have paralithic contact between a depth of 20 inches and lithic contact. Rock fragments of shale range from 5 to 65 percent in the A, Ap, and E horizons, and 25 to 90 percent in the Bw/Bt and C horizons. A thin discontinuous argillic horizon is present in some part of the pedon. In unlimed soils, reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. Value of 2 or 3 is limited to horizons less than 6 inches thick. The A horizon is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. It is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 8, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw/Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 through 8. Each pedon has a cambic horizon (Bw) and a discontinuous argillic horizon (Bt). The Bw part is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. The Bt part is clay loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 6. It is strongly weathered multicolored shale with thin lenses of loam, clay loam, silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. The shale fragments easily crush to fine earth material.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 6. It is slightly weathered shale that crushes to loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Litz soils are on uplands with narrow convex ridges and long slightly convex sideslopes. The relief is gently sloping through very steep with slope gradients ranging between 2 and 80 percent. The soils formed in material weathered from leached calcareous shale with, in some places, widely spaced thin strata of limestone, only about 20 to 25 percent of the parent rock being shale, only about 10 to 25 percent of the parent rock being calcareous. The mean annual temperature ranges from about 48 degrees to 59 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation ranges from about 36 to 48 inches."

The Berks, Muskingum, and Wurno soils do not have a discontinuous argillic horizon. The Caneyville, Chilhowie, Gilpin, Groseclose, Lodi and Westmoreland soils have a continuous argillic horizon. The Chiswell and Dandridge soils have paralithic contact within a depth of 20 inches of the surface. The Newbern, Unicoi, and Weikert soils have a lithic contact within 20 inches of the surface. The Hayter, Murrill, and Tumbling soils are very deep to bedrock and have formed in colluvium."
