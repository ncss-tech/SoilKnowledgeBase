  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches. Rock fragments of gravel and cobbles of quartz and crystalline rock range from 0 to 15 percent in the solum and from 0 to 35 percent in the substratum. Dark concretions of iron and manganese range from none to common. Flakes of mica are few to common in most pedons, but range to many in the C horizon of some pedons. Few to common amounts of yellow kaolinitic flakes are in the lower part of the B horizon and in the C horizon of many pedons, and range to many in the C horizon of some pedons. The soil is slightly acid through very strongly acid except where the surface has been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 4 to 8. The lower part of the\nBt horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 8. The Bt horizon in each pedon must have at least one subhorizon with moist value of 3 or less and at least one subhorizon with moist value of 4. Typically, the upper Bt horizon is moist value 3, the middle part is moist value 3 or 4, and the lower part is moist value 4. Few to common mottles in shades of red, yellow, or brown may occur in the lower Bt horizon. Texture is clay, sandy clay, clay loam, or silty clay in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10R to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8 or is mottled or streaked with these colors. It is saprolite that is clay loam, loam, sandy clay loam, silt loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lloyd soils are gently sloping to steep and are on uplands in the Southern Piedmont. Slopes range between 2 and 50 percent and are generally between 2 and 10 percent. The soil formed in residuum derived from intermediate and mafic, igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks. Near the type location, mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is approximately 45 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: In addition to the competing Gwinnett, these include the Cecil, Davidson, Enon, Madison, Mecklenburg, Musella and Pacolet series. Cecil and Pacolet soils are on nearby uplands, and the soils formed in residuum from the underlying felsic igneous and high-grade metamorphic rock. Madison soils are on nearby uplands, and the soils formed in the underlying felsic high-grade metamorphic residuum that is high in mica content. The other associated soils formed in residuum of similar kind to which Lloyd soils formed. These soils also occur in the same kind of upland landscape positions as Lloyd. None of the associated soils except for Cecil, Davidson, Gwinnett, Madison and Pacolet have a kandic horizon."

Understory plants include dogwood, winged elm, eastern hophornbeam, eastern redbud, eastern red cedar, and sassafras."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were combined with Hiwassee in 1969. Hiwassee series was originally established on high stream terraces. This revision separates the soils formed in residuum as Lloyd on the basis of parent material and depth of Rhodic colors. Terrace Hiwassee soils are dominantly value 3 or less throughout. A proposal to amend the 1996 Keys to Soil Taxonomy involves changing the thickness of the part of the kandic horizon with value of 3 or less to include more soils in the Rhodic subgroup.  2006 revision was made to add Agricola as a competing series.\nADDITIONAL DATA: S97GA-159-001 NSSL\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nArgillic and kandic horizon - the zone from 7 to 61 inches. It meets the low activity clay requirements for kandic in more than 50 percent of the upper 40 inches of the horizon.\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nMLRA: 136\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nNC0057 Lloyd       2- 50   58- 65  190-230  43- 55   400-1200\nNC0185 Lloyd       2- 50   58- 65  190-230  43- 55   400-1200\nNC0213 Lloyd       2- 50   58- 65  190-230  43- 55   400-1200\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nNC0057 NONE          6.0-6.0              -     60-60\nNC0185 NONE          6.0-6.0              -     60-60\nNC0213 NONE          6.0-6.0              -     60-60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nNC0057  0- 7  SL FSL                  0-  2  90-100  7-20   2- 10\nNC0057  0- 7  SIL                     0-  2  90-100 10-25   2- 10\nNC0057  0- 7  CL SCL L                0-  2  95-100 10-35   3- 10\nNC0057  7-61  C SIC CL                0-  2  95-100 35-60   4- 15\nNC0057 61-70  SL L SCL                0-  5  85- 99  7-35   2- 10\nNC0185  0- 7  GR-CL GR-L GR-SCL       2- 10  65- 90 10-30   3- 10\nNC0185  7-61  C SIC CL                0-  2  90-100 35-60   4- 15\nNC0185 61-70  SL L SCL                0-  5  85- 99  7-35   2- 10\nNC0213  0- 7  CB-SL CB-FSL           15- 30  75- 90  8-18   2- 10\nNC0213  7-61  C SIC CL                0-  5  90-100 35-60   4- 15\nNC0213 61-70  SL L SCL                0-  5  90-100  7-35   2- 10\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
