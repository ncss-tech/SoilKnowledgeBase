  "OVERVIEW": "The Lloyd series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on uplands in the Southern Piedmont. The soils formed in residuum derived from intermediate and mafic, igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks. Slopes are commonly 2 to 10 percent but range to 50 percent. Near the type location, mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches. Rock fragments of gravel and cobbles of quartz and crystalline rock range from 0 to 15 percent in the solum and from 0 to 35 percent in the substratum. Dark concretions of iron and manganese range from none to common. Flakes of mica are few to common in most pedons, but range to many in the C horizon of some pedons. Few to common amounts of yellow kaolinitic flakes are in the lower part of the B horizon and in the C horizon of many pedons, and range to many in the C horizon of some pedons. The soil is slightly acid through very strongly acid except where the surface has been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 4 to 8. The lower part of the\nBt horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 8. The Bt horizon in each pedon must have at least one subhorizon with moist value of 3 or less and at least one subhorizon with moist value of 4. Typically, the upper Bt horizon is moist value 3, the middle part is moist value 3 or 4, and the lower part is moist value 4. Few to common mottles in shades of red, yellow, or brown may occur in the lower Bt horizon. Texture is clay, sandy clay, clay loam, or silty clay in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10R to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8 or is mottled or streaked with these colors. It is saprolite that is clay loam, loam, sandy clay loam, silt loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction."

Madison soils are on nearby uplands, and the soils formed in the underlying felsic high-grade metamorphic residuum that is high in mica content. The other associated soils formed in residuum of similar kind to which Lloyd soils formed. These soils also occur in the same kind of upland landscape positions as Lloyd. None of the associated soils except for Cecil, Davidson, Gwinnett, Madison and Pacolet have a kandic horizon."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were combined with Hiwassee in 1969. Hiwassee series was originally established on high stream terraces. This revision separates the soils formed in residuum as Lloyd on the basis of parent material and depth of Rhodic colors. Terrace Hiwassee soils are dominantly value 3 or less throughout. A proposal to amend the 1996 Keys to Soil Taxonomy involves changing the thickness of the part of the kandic horizon with value of 3 or less to include more soils in the Rhodic subgroup.  2006 revision was made to add Agricola as a competing series."
