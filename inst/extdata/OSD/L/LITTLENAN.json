  "OVERVIEW": "The Littlenan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum derived from gypsiferous shale.  Littlenan soils are on structural benches and hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
