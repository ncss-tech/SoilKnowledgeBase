Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 15 inches (Ap, Bt horizons); and argillic horizon from 6 to 30 inches that is also the particle-size control section (Bt, Btk horizons); accumulations of calcium carbonates from 15 to 42 inches (Btk, Bk horizons).  Linnet soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory sample S68MT-013-5.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
