  "OVERVIEW": "The Linnet series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium and glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on lake plains, stream terraces, alluvial fans, drainageways, and till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 120 days.",
