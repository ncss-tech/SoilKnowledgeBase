  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 5 to 15 inches.  These soils typically have free carbonates throughout; however, in some pedons the upper 6 inches are noncalcareous.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.  The upper horizons may contain soluble salts.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  If value is 5 and 3 moist, the A horizon is less than 7 inches thick.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy loam and commonly contains thin sandy or clayey strata.  The lower part of the C horizon is mottled with colors of higher chroma.  Some pedons have AC horizons having color and texture like the C horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy sand, fine sand, sand, or coarse sand, typically containing some gravel.  Mottles are faint through prominent or lacking.  Depth to the 2C horizon is more than 40 inches."

The Tefton soils have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 50 degrees F.  The Werlog soils lack stratification above 40 inches.  Angelus soils are fine-silty. Caruso, Lesho, Sweetwater, and Uncompahgre soils have mollic epipedons.  In addition, Lesho and Sweetwater soils have contrasting textures and are thermic; Uncompahgre soils are wetter; and Wann soils are coarse-loamy.  Las Animas soils are wetter and have coarse-loamy textures."
