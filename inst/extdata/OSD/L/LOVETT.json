  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Soil reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid in the solum, and ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid in the C horizon.  Weighted average clay content of the particle size control section is 18 to 35 percent.  Silt content is less than 20 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue 10YR, value 3 to 5, chroma 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon has hue 10YR, value 4 to 6, chroma 3 to 6.\nTextures of the A and E horizons are loamy fine sand, fine sand, or sand.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue 10YR or 7.5YR, value 5 or 6, chroma 6 to 8.  Red, brown, and yellow mottles range from none to common, increasing with depth.  Chroma 2 or less mottling is at depths greater than 36 inches.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  Some pedons contain 1 to 5 percent plinthite or ironstone nodules.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon has hue 10YR or 7.5YR, value 5 or 6, chroma 6 to 8.  It has few to many red, brown, yellow, and gray mottles.  It is coarsely mottled with these colors in some pedons, lacking a matrix color.  It is sandy clay or clay.\nThe C horizon is reticulately mottled and varicolored in hues ranging from 10R through 10YR.  Its texture is sandy clay or clay."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Autryville, Bonneau, Boykin, Briley, Letney, Lowndes, Lucy, Trep, and Wagram series in the same family.  Autryville and Lowndes are bisequal.  Bonneau has an apparent water table and moderate permeability.  Boykin, Briley, and Lucy soils have Bt horizons with dominant hues redder than 7.5YR.  Letney and Wagram soils do not have mottles of chroma 2 or less within 60 inches.  Trep soils are in climatic regions which receive less than 50 inches of precipitation annually and have moderately slow permeability."

Esto, Nankin, and Orangeburg soils are on slightly higher landscape positions and have a sandy epipedon less than 20 inches thick.  Albany, Ocilla, and Plummer soils are on lower lying landscapes and are somewhat poorly or poorly drained.  Blanton soils have loamy argillic horizons starting at depths below 40 inches of the surface."
