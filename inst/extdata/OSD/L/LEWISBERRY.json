  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from about 30 to 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 4 to 7 or more feet.  Rock fragments range from 4 to 40 percent in the upper part of the solum and from 20 to 50 percent in the lower part.  Rock fragments are mainly water-rounded pebbles, cobbles, and stones, from the conglomerate, of white to pink quartz ranging in diameter from 1/8 inch to more than one foot; in some places they are angular fragments of reddish sandstone.  The C horizon usually contains more than 40 percent rock fragments.  About 1/3 of the area is very stony phases.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum, usually becoming less acid in the C horizon.  Base saturation increases with depth.\nAreas that have been tilled or heavily grazed have an Ap horizon with hue ranging from 7.5YR through 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is sandy loam in the fine earth-fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue ranging from 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Textures range from loam to sandy loam in the fine earth-fraction.\nB horizons have hue ranging from 5YR through 10R, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Total thickness of the Bt horizon ranges from 18 to 30 inches.  Clay content ranges from about 10 to 18 percent in the particle-size control section.  The largest amount of clay is usually just above the C horizon.\nC horizon characteristics are obscured by the large amounts of rock fragments. They typically have colors like the B horizon and a fine earth texture of loam, sandy loam or loamy sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Chavies, Cranston, Highfield, and Tracy soils are in the same family.  Chavies soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the solum.  Cranston and Highfield soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower.  Tracy soils formed in glacial outwash and contain a high portion of shale fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on gently sloping to steep hills and ridges.  Slopes are mainly between 3 and 25 percent, but they range from 0 to 40 percent.  The regolith is moderately coarse textured residuum weathered from reddish, weakly cemented, conglomerate, and sandstone.  The climate is humid temperate; mean annual precipitation ranges from  38 to 48 inches; mean annual air temperature ranges from 50 to 55 degrees F., and the frost-free season ranges from 170 to 200 days."

Bucks, Edgemont, Neshaminy, Penn, and Readington soils contain more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control sections.  Edgemont, Lansdale, and Steinsburg soils do not have reddish hues and have thinner sola.  Penn soils have thinner sola.  Readington soils have a fragipan."
