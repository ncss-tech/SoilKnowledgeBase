  "OVERVIEW": "The Lewisberry series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum from reddish, weakly cemented conglomerate, and sandstone.  Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent.  Permeability is moderately rapid. Mean annual precipitation is 43 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from about 30 to 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 4 to 7 or more feet.  Rock fragments range from 4 to 40 percent in the upper part of the solum and from 20 to 50 percent in the lower part.  Rock fragments are mainly water-rounded pebbles, cobbles, and stones, from the conglomerate, of white to pink quartz ranging in diameter from 1/8 inch to more than one foot; in some places they are angular fragments of reddish sandstone.  The C horizon usually contains more than 40 percent rock fragments.  About 1/3 of the area is very stony phases.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum, usually becoming less acid in the C horizon.  Base saturation increases with depth.\nAreas that have been tilled or heavily grazed have an Ap horizon with hue ranging from 7.5YR through 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is sandy loam in the fine earth-fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue ranging from 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Textures range from loam to sandy loam in the fine earth-fraction.\nB horizons have hue ranging from 5YR through 10R, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Total thickness of the Bt horizon ranges from 18 to 30 inches.  Clay content ranges from about 10 to 18 percent in the particle-size control section.  The largest amount of clay is usually just above the C horizon.\nC horizon characteristics are obscured by the large amounts of rock fragments. They typically have colors like the B horizon and a fine earth texture of loam, sandy loam or loamy sand."

Cranston and Highfield soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower.  Tracy soils formed in glacial outwash and contain a high portion of shale fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

The regolith is moderately coarse textured residuum weathered from reddish, weakly cemented, conglomerate, and sandstone.  The climate is humid temperate; mean annual precipitation ranges from  38 to 48 inches; mean annual air temperature ranges from 50 to 55 degrees F., and the frost-free season ranges from 170 to 200 days."

Edgemont, Lansdale, and Steinsburg soils do not have reddish hues and have thinner sola.  Penn soils have thinner sola.  Readington soils have a fragipan."

Argillic horizon - the zone from 19 to 47 inches (Bt horizon).\n2/2022 revisions: 1. Oi layer was removed from the typical pedon description because /freshly fallen, or undecomposed leaf litter or simlar undeceomposed material should not be included as a surface layer in the soil description. 2. The Oe had 1  to 0 inch depths, corrected to be 0 to 1 in horizon depths then added 1 inch to all horizon depths throughout the typical pedon. WJN"
