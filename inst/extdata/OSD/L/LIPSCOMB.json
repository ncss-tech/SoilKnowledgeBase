  "OVERVIEW": "The Lipscomb series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian deposits derived from the Laverne Member, Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils occur on undulating to rolling dunes and sandsheets emplaced over hillslopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 584 mm (23 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 14.4 degrees C (58 degrees F).",
