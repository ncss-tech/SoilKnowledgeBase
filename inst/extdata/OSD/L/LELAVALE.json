  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lelavale series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of Pleistocene age.  These are depressional soils on nearly level coastal plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent slope but mainly less than 0.5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1350 mm (53 in).",
