  "OVERVIEW": "The Lemroi series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from flood deposited sand and gravel.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.  Lemroi soils are on stream terraces, valley flats and flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
