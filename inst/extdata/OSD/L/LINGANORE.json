  "OVERVIEW": "The Linganore series consists of soils that are moderately deep to paralithic contact or to schist or phyllite bedrock.  They are well drained soils on uplands. They formed in residuum from hard micaceous schists and phyllites.  Slopes range from 0 to 55 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 51 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 40 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock or paralithic contact is 22 to 58 inches.  Rock fragment content of micaceous schist and phyllite ranges from 20 to 50 percent by volume in the A horizon and from 35 to 75 percent by volume in the B and C horizons.  Some pedons contain angular gravels and cobbles of quartzite or up to 15 percent stones of schist or phyllite.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 to 4; value of 3 is confined to A horizons.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Uncultivated areas may have an E horizon.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8, but may be as low as 2.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue 0f 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, an chroma of 2 through 8.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine earth fraction."

Airy, and Skalan series are similar soils in related families.  Brandywine soils have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections and contain coarse fragments of gneiss.  The Cardiff and Mt. Airy soils have cambic horizons.  The Skalan soils have a xeric moisture regime."

They formed in residuum from micaceous schist, phyllite, and slate. Slopes range from 0 to 55 percent but generally are between 3 and 25 percent.  The climate is temperate and humid, with a mean annual temperature of 50 to 55 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation of 40 inches."

Baile soils are poorly drained and are on upland depressions and footslopes.  Cardiff, Chester, Glenelg, and Mt. Airy soils are in similar positions on the landscape as the Linganore soils.  Chester soils do not have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  Glenelg soils have less than 35 percent base saturation.  Glenville and Urbana soils have fragipans and are on upland flats, sideslopes, and footslopes."
