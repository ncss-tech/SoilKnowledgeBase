    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lomira soils typically are on ground moraines.  Slope ranges from 0 and 20 percent.  These soils formed in loess and in the underlying, highly calcareous loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges between 711 to 838 mm (28 and 33 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges between 7.2 to 9.4 degrees C (45 and 49 degrees F)."

    "content": "REMARKS:\n10/04- The location given for the typical pedon in the OSD differs from the location given for the same pedon in the published soil survey. The location in the OSD does not fall in or near a map unit of Lomira. The location in the published survey is just outside of a B-slope Lomira map unit. Therefore, this revision uses the location from the published survey after correcting it slightly to place it in the Lomira map unit.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - 0 to 36 cm (0 to 14 inches) (Ap, E, BE);  argillic horizon -  36 to 86 cm (14 to 34 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
