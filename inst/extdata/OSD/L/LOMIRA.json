The location in the OSD does not fall in or near a map unit of Lomira. The location in the published survey is just outside of a B-slope Lomira map unit. Therefore, this revision uses the location from the published survey after correcting it slightly to place it in the Lomira map unit.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - 0 to 36 cm (0 to 14 inches) (Ap, E, BE);  argillic horizon -  36 to 86 cm (14 to 34 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3)"
