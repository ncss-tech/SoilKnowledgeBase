  "OVERVIEW": "The Ligget series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in quartz diorite. Ligget soils are on dissected hills and mountains and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent. Permeability is moderately rapid. The average annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
