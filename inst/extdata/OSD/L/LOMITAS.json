    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lomitas soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 5 to 65 percent.  They formed in alluvium and colluvium from andesite, rhyolite, tuff, volcanic breccia, basalt and to some extent metamorphic rocks.  Elevation is 1,000 to 3,000 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 2 to 10 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain.  Mean annual air temperature is 69 to 78 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 240 to 350 days."
