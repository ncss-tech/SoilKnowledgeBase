  "OVERVIEW": "The Luppino series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from granodiorite. Luppino soils are on pediments and hills.  The slopes are 4 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
