    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bolivar,  Pamunkey, Sandhill, Stiversville and Toine series in the same family and the Cahaba and Dexter series in similar families.  Bolivar soils have a thinner solum.   Pamunkey, Sandhill and Stiverville soils are underlain by bedrock at a depth of 40 to 65 inches.  Toine soils have argillic horizons with yellower hue. Cahaba soils have less than 35 percent base saturation in the lower parts of the sola.  Dexter soils have fine-silty argillic horizons."
