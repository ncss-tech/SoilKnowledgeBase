Depth to the top of the sandy argillic ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the clayey argillic ranges from 50 to more than 80 inches.  Volume of gravel is less than 1 percent in the sandy mantle and in the clayey lacustrine deposits.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral throughout.  Redox accumulations and saturation occur within 40 inches at some time in most years.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is loamy fine sand.\nThe Bw horizons has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together.  Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe 2Btg and 2Bt horizons have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay or silty clay.
