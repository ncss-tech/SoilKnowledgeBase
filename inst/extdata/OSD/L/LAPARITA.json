  "OVERVIEW": "The Laparita series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and clayey alluvium over residuum of the Jackson Group.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on headslopes, toeslopes and footslopes of interfluves.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent but are mainly less than 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm (24 in) and mean annual temperature is about 22.2 degrees C (72 degrees F).",

This soil has a fine control section as well as Vertic Properties. The classification was changed to include the pachic vertic subgroup which is current with the Eleventh Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 20 to 56 cm (8 to 22 in) (Bt and Btk horizons)\nMollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 56 cm (0 to 22 in) (A, Bt, and Btk horizon).\nArgillic horizon: The zone from 20 to 56 cm (8 to 22 in) (Bt and Btk horizon).\nVertic feature: The presence of pressure facesat 20 to 76 cm (8 and 30 in).(Bt,Btk,and BCkz1 horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity: Occurs at 117 cm\nADDITIONAL DATA: Local lab data from the McMullen project office available on pedons from McMullen County.\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
