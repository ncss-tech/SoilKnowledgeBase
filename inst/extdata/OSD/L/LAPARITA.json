    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Laparita soils were formerly included in the Orelia series. The Orelia series has a fine-loamy control section. This soil has a fine control section as well as Vertic Properties. The classification was changed to include the pachic vertic subgroup which is current with the Eleventh Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 20 to 56 cm (8 to 22 in) (Bt and Btk horizons)\nMollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 56 cm (0 to 22 in) (A, Bt, and Btk horizon).\nArgillic horizon: The zone from 20 to 56 cm (8 to 22 in) (Bt and Btk horizon).\nVertic feature: The presence of pressure facesat 20 to 76 cm (8 and 30 in).(Bt,Btk,and BCkz1 horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity: Occurs at 117 cm\nADDITIONAL DATA: Local lab data from the McMullen project office available on pedons from McMullen County.\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
