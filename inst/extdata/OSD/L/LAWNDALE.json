The source of the sandy material was nearby stream valleys or outwash plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.6 to 11.7 degrees C (51 to 53 degrees F), annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1016 millimeters (36 to 40 inches), frost free days range from 175 to 185, and elevation ranges from 155.5 to 289.6 meters (510 to 950 feet) above mean sea level."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the loess and high to very high ( 14.11 to 141. 14 micrometers per second) in the sandy deposits. These soils have moderate permeability in the loess, and moderately rapid or rapid permeability in the sandy deposits. The depth to the top of an apparent high water ranges from 30 to 61 centimeters (1 to 2 feet) in the spring in normal years."
