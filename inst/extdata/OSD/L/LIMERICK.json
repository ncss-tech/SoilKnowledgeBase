Reaction ranges from strongly acid through neutral. The weighted average of fine and coarser sands, in the particle-size control section, is less than 15 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is commonly silt loam but includes very fine sandy loam. Structure is typically weak or moderate, fine or medium granular. Some A horizons have weak or moderate medium subangular blocky structure. Consistence is friable or very friable. Redoximorphic features, where present, are few through many, fine through coarse and faint through prominent.\nSome pedons have one or more Ab horizons with hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is commonly silt loam but includes very fine sandy loam. The horizons are massive and friable.\nSome pedons have a Bg horizon, 6 through 8 inches (15 through 20 centimeters) thick, with hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is commonly silt loam, but includes silt and very fine sandy loam. Structure is weak granular or subangular blocky, or the horizon is massive. Consistence is friable. Redoximorphic features are few through many, fine through coarse and distinct or prominent.\nThe BCg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is commonly silt loam, but includes silt and very fine sandy loam. Strata of loamy very fine sand, very fine sand, or fine sand .2 through .5 inches (.5 through 1.3 centimeters) thick are present in some horizons. The horizon is massive and friable or very friable. Redoximorphic features range from few through many, fine through coarse and faint through prominent.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR through 5GY, or is neutral, value of 4, and chroma of 0 through 2. Texture is commonly silt loam but includes silt and very fine sandy loam. Some pedons have thin strata (less than .2 inches) (.5 centimeters) that vary in color, texture, or reaction. Redoximorphic features, where present, are few through many and fine or medium prominent. The horizon is massive and friable.\nSome pedons have a 2Cg horizon below a depth of 40 inches (100 centimeters). It has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 4. Texture is fine sandy loam through sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Oridia and Skokomish soils are currently the only other series in this family. Oridia and Skokomish series are from Land Reasource Region A in the Pacific Northwest.\nThe Lim, Rippowam, and Rumney series are in related families. They have a weighted average of fine sand or coarser in the particle-size control section of more than 15 percent. Rumney soils have a cooler mean annual soil temperature."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Limerick soils are on the flood plains of major rivers and their larger tributaries. In some places they are on the flood plains of small streams. They may be on broad flat areas or in shallow depressions. The soils formed in recent alluvial deposits that are dominantly silt and very fine sand. Mean annual temperature ranges from about 45 through 52 degrees F. (7 through 11 degrees C.), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 through 50 inches (762 through 1270 millimeters). The frost-free season ranges from 105 through 180 days."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for long term hay and pasture. A few areas have been drained, and cultivated crops are grown. Common trees in wooded areas are red maple and eastern white pine. Additional woody species are alders, willows, black ash, green ash, swamp birch, river birch, silky willow, and pussy willow. Common herbaceous species include cinnamon fern, nettle, and skunk cabbage."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: 1. With this revision the classification is changed from Coarse-silty, mixed, active, nonacid, mesic Fluvaquentic Endoaquepts  to Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Fluvaquentic Endoaquepts. This reflects  a review of current lab data available for this series, S70MA015004, S70MA015005 and S06CT003-001 were some of the selected lab pedons used to make the determination.\n2. The use of the Limerick series in Maine, and in MLRA 143 and 144B, is relict to before temperature classes. These have been removed from the SC file.\n3.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (0 to 20 centimeters) (Ap horizon).\nb. Cambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 54 inches (20 to 137 centimeters) (BCg horizons).\nc. Aquept feature - Within 20 inches (50 centimeters) of the soil surface the matrix has chroma of 2 or less with redox concentrations.\nd. Fluvaquentic feature: The organic-carbon content is presumed to decrease irregularly with depth between 10 through 50 inches (25 through 125 centimeters).\ne. Nonacid reaction class - the pH is presumed to be 5.0 or more in 0.01m CaCl2 in at least some part of the control section.\nf. The material composing the Cg layer is presumed to change color upon exposure to air thereby not meeting the criteria for a Cambic horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
