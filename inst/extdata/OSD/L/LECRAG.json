These soils formed in material weathered from desitic flows and agglomerate of the Quien Sabe formation.  The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 to 24 inches.  Mean January temperature is 42 degrees F; mean July temperature is 71 degrees; mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F.

    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were mapped as Rough Stony Land in the Los Banos Area, Series 1939 report.  They are being differentiated by being deep, lacking stones and having tree and grass cover.  pH determined by colormetric method using Hellige-Truog Triplex indicators.  Base saturation determined by sum of the cations using KC1-triethanolamine extract.  Texture determined by hydrometer method.  Organic matter determined by Walkley-Black digestion method.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
