They are being differentiated by being deep, lacking stones and having tree and grass cover.  pH determined by colormetric method using Hellige-Truog Triplex indicators.  Base saturation determined by sum of the cations using KC1-triethanolamine extract.  Texture determined by hydrometer method.  Organic matter determined by Walkley-Black digestion method.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
