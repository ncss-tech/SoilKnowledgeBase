Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 20 to 40 percent and averages 25 to 35 percent.  Redoximorphic features such as iron-manganese masses (N 2/0) and oxidized iron masses (10YR 4/6, 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/6, 5YR 4/6, 5/6) occur below 30 inches, (76 cm).  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Cd horizon dry color is 2.5Y 7/4, 7/3, 6/4, 10YR 4/4 or 6/4.  Moist color is 2.5Y 4/4, 5/3, 5/4 or 10YR 4/4.  Texture is loam, silt loam, silt, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Clay content ranges from 5 to 20 percent.  Redoximorphic features such as iron-manganese masses (N 2/0) moist, and oxidized iron masses (10YR 4/6, 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/6, 5YR 4/6, 5/6) moist, occur in pores and on fragment faces.  Rupture resistance ranges from slightly hard to very hard and varies within the same horizon.  Cementation class is noncemented.
