The ashy surface mantle has a moist bulk density of 0.60 to 1.00 glcc, it has 30 to 60 percent glass, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron is more than 2 percent and 15 bar water is 5 to 12 percent on dry samples.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  Some pedons have a variegated appearance with 10YR 6/3 and 5/6 colors. Some pedons have an E horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.

The Larrupin soils formed in coarse volcanic ash overlying a volcanic  mudflow.  The climate is marine influenced with relatively cool, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 90 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 130 to 160 days."
