  "OVERVIEW": "The Larrupin series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash overlying a volcanic mudflow.  Larrupin soils are on valley bottoms and adjacent mountain side slopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 75 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
