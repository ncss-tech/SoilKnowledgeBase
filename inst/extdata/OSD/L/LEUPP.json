  "OVERVIEW": "The Leupp series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed from residuum weathered from calcareous sandstone.  Leupp soils are on structural benches.   Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.",
