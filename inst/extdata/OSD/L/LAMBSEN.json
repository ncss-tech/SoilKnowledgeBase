  "OVERVIEW": "The Lambsen series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, shale, limestone and quartzite rocks.  Lambsen soils are on strath terraces. Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
