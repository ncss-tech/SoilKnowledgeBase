  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the human transported materials ranges from 165 centimeters or more thick and is a mix of coal slag, dredged materials, and/or any geologic deposits ranging from till, outwash, alluvium, or coastal plain sediments usually from a local source. There may be a thin loamy capping that is relatively clean of refuse, with less than 20 percent rock fragments. Rock fragments (by volume) are 35 percent or more in the particle size control section. Artifactual, very artifactual or extremely artifactual modifiers are common. Artifacts found within the upper fill materials may not be present in underlying dredged or natural soils. Dredged materials may have shell fragments. Lithological discontinuities are common features in many pedons. Textures of the fine earth fraction include loamy sand to sand. Finer textured materials are generally not within the control section. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a thin O horizon.\nThe ^A, ^Au, ^ABu or ^ACu horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 4. Consistence is very friable or friable. Structure is granular or subangular blocky.\nThe ^C or ^Cu horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 6. The layer is single grain, massive or subangular blocky. Some pedons have ^Cdu horizons with properties similar to the ^Cu horizon.\nSome pedons have ^Cg horizons that have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or N, value of 3 or 4, and a chroma of 2 or less. The structure is single grain or massive.\nSome pedons have C or Cg horizons that reflect the characteristics of the original buried soil materials which is typically sand bar deposits."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ladyliberty soils are on nearly level to gently sloping artificially created or modified landforms in filled areas. These soils formed in human transported materials 165 cm or more thick. There may be a thin loamy capping over the coal slag, dredged materials, and/or geologic material. The transported geologic material is dominantly from locally excavated till, alluvium, outwash, and/or coastal plains sediments. Dredged materials may have shells fragments. Natural rock fragments when present are derived mainly from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1021 to 1325 millimeters. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 17 degrees Celsius."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fortress, Laguardia, Rikers, and Secaucus soils on nearby landscapes. Fortress soils are moderately well drained and formed in similar materials but have less than 20 percent fragments.  Laguardia soils are well drained, have a loamy particle size class, and are formed in a thick mantle of construction debris intermingled with human transported materials. Secaucus soils have a loamy skeletal particle size class and are formed in a thick mantle of human transported material consisting of a mixture of construction debris and other anthropogenic fill materials. Rikers soils are excessively well drained and are formed in unburned coal and coal ash."

The potential for surface runoff is high where the soil is compacted and/or un-vegetated. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in areas where the soil has not been compacted and is moderately low in areas of compaction."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of these soils are used for recreation, wildlife habitat, or industrial and urban development. These soils are generally covered with weeds such as goldenrod, mugwort, bittersweet, Japanese knotweed, woodbine, and poison ivy. There may also be pioneer and sapling species present such as poplar, staghorn sumac, white pine, black cherry, willow, gray birch, quaking aspen, and red oak. If the soils are found in a recreational area, turf grass may also be the dominant vegetation."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Ladyliberty soils often exhibit an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth however this is a result of anthropogenic filling (deposition) not alluvial deposition; excluding them from the concept of Fluvents. Proposed revisions to soil taxonomy in ICOMANTH Circular Letter 7 developed for anthropogenic soils will help to clarify this difference.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - 0 to 16 cm (^Au horizon).\n2. Sandy-skeletal - 41 percent rock fragments (by volume) in the particle size control section (25 to 100 centimeters)\n3. Oxyaquic classification- water table at a depth of 112 cm from the soil surface.\n4. In coal slag horizons, the carbon content is from these materials and should not have a mucky modifier. Carbon contents are not related to organic material deposition.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Full characterization data for sample no. 2010NJ017009. Pedon analyzed by the NSSL, Lincoln, NE. The typical pedon is no. 2010NJ017001. Support pedons used to develop this series include 2010NJ017003, 2010NJ017005, 2010NJ017010, 2010NJ017012 and 2010NJ017017.\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
