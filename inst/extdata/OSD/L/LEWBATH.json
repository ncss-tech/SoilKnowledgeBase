    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 102 to 191 cm (40 to 75 in) or more. Depth to bedrock is greater than 152 cm (60 in). Depth to the top of the fragipan ranges from 51 to 97 cm (20 to 38 in). Rock fragments, dominantly channers and flagstones, range from 5 to 35 percent by volume above the fragipan; from 15 to 50 percent in the fragipan; and from 15 to 60 percent in the substratum. The fine-earth fraction of the Bx and C horizons have over 50 percent silt plus very fine sand. Reaction, in unlimed areas, ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid in the solum and from very strongly acid through slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam. Structure is weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nUndisturbed areas have thin dark A horizons and some have thin E horizons. Thin BA horizons may be present in some places. Some undisturbed pedons have a thin O horizon.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam. Structure is granular, platy, or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. The texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam. Structure is weak or moderate platy or subangular blocky. Consistence is firm or friable.\nAn E or E' horizon is present above the Bx horizon in some pedons. The horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam. Redoximorphic features may be present below a depth of 71 cm (28 in) in the BE or E horizons.\nThe Bx horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam. Structure is coarse or very coarse prismatic with platy, blocky, or massive interiors. Consistence is firm or very firm. Redoximorphic features may be present below a depth of 71 cm (28 in) in the Bx horizons.\nThe Cd or C horizon, if present, has color and texture similar to the Bx horizon. The horizon is massive or has plate-like divisions."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lewbath soils are on uplands of glaciated dissected plateaus and till plains and mainly occur on convex hilltops and hillsides. Slopes range from 3 to 55 percent. The soils developed in firm till derived from sandstone, siltstone, and shale.  Annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 9 degrees C (39 to 48 degrees F). Annual precipitation ranges from 825 to 1790 mm (32 to 70 in) and the frost free days range from 110 to 155 days. Elevation ranges from 425 to 1100 m (1394 to 3608 ft) above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Lewbath soils are the well-drained member of a drainage sequence which includes the moderately well drained Willdin soils, the somewhat poorly drained Ontusia soils, and the poorly drained Norchip soil. Moderately deep, well drained Mongaup soils, and shallow, somewhat excessively drained and well drained Hawksnest soils are closely associated on nearby landforms where the soil mantle is thinner over bedrock. Valois soils are on adjacent lower valley sides where the glacial till is less dense."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Cleared areas are used for growing corn for silage, small grains, hay, and pasture. A significant acreage has reverted to woodland or brush. Native vegetation is sugar maple, beech, northern red oak, black cherry, and white ash. Brushy areas often contain blueberry, spirea, Hawthorne (thorn apple), and poplar."
