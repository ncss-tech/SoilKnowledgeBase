  "OVERVIEW": "The Lewbath series consists of very deep, well drained soils on uplands at high elevations. They formed in till derived from brownish or gray colored sandstone, siltstone, and shale. A dense fragipan is present starting at a depth of 51 to 97 cm (20 to 38 in) below the soil surface. Slopes range from 3 to 55 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C (45 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 1120 mm (44 in).",

Reaction, in unlimed areas, ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid in the solum and from very strongly acid through slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam. Structure is weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nUndisturbed areas have thin dark A horizons and some have thin E horizons. Thin BA horizons may be present in some places. Some undisturbed pedons have a thin O horizon.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam. Structure is granular, platy, or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.

The soils developed in firm till derived from sandstone, siltstone, and shale.  Annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 9 degrees C (39 to 48 degrees F). Annual precipitation ranges from 825 to 1790 mm (32 to 70 in) and the frost free days range from 110 to 155 days. Elevation ranges from 425 to 1100 m (1394 to 3608 ft) above sea level."

Moderately deep, well drained Mongaup soils, and shallow, somewhat excessively drained and well drained Hawksnest soils are closely associated on nearby landforms where the soil mantle is thinner over bedrock. Valois soils are on adjacent lower valley sides where the glacial till is less dense."
