  "OVERVIEW": "The Laval series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitic and/or sedimentary rock. The Laval soils are on alluvial fans and/or flood plains. Slope is 1 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 178 to 254 mm (7 to 10 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C (64 degrees F).",
