  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 31 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Texture is silt loam throughout.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 20 percent in individual horizons, but the weighted average is 10 percent or less.  They are mainly gravel size.  Consistence is friable or very friable throughout.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the surface horizon, from moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the subsoil, and from moderately acid to strongly alkaline in the substratum.\nThe Ap, or A horizon where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  They have granular structure.  Some uncultivated areas have a thin 0 horizon at the soil surface.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It has granular, subangular blocky or platy structure.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It has granular or platy structure or it is massive.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It has platy structure or it is massive.\nThe bedrock is mainly metamorphosed limestone, calcareous sandstone or calcareous shale."

The Elliottsville, Tunbridge and Winnecook soils all have spodic horizons.  The Mapleton soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Linneus soils are on till plains, hills and ridges.  Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent, but is dominantly less than 15.  The soils formed in a moderately deep mantle of glacial till derived mainly from metamorphosed limestone, calcareous sandstone and shale.  The climate is humid and cool temperate.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 43 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 40 inches.  The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 120 days.  Elevation ranges from 350 to 1200 feet above mean sea level."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  1.  This revision reflects a change in classification from coarse-loamy, mixed, frigid Dystric Eutrochrepts to coarse-loamy, isotic, frigid Dystric Eutrochrepts.  2. This revision also includes a change in the type location to better reflect field conditions.  3.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 11 inches;\nb.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 11 to 26 inches;\nc.  Lithic contact - unweathered bedrock at 32 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Source of data used in establishing the taxonomic class and the range in characteristics is Maine Agricultural Experiment Station, Technical Bulletin 137, February 1990.\nThe Soil Interpretation Record number for the Linneus series is ME0039.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
