  "OVERVIEW": "The Linwell series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium or colluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, hills, escarpments and plains.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
