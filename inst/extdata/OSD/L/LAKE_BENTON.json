    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lake Benton soils have plane to convex slopes ranging from 2 to 12 percent and are typically found on rims of ice walled lakes. They formed in 40 to 60 inches of loamy and sandy outwash sediments over silty glacial lacustrine material.  Mean annual air temperature is about 38 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 to 27 inches. The frost free period ranges from 120 to 170 days. Elevation ranges from 890 to 1,950 feet above sea level."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity, expressed in inches per hour, is 2 to 6 in the upper layers,  6 to 20 in the sandy layers and .6 to 2 in the underlying material.  Seasonal high saturation occurs between depths of 40 to 60 inches during the months April through June in years of normal precipitation."
