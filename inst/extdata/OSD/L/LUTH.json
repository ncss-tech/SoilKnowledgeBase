Hues of the\nAC horizons are dominantly 10YR and 7.5YR but range to 5YR.\nTexture of the control section is clay loam, or clay with more than 35 percent clay in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Luth soils occur in drainageways on nearly level to gently sloping flood plains and low terraces in the ponderosa pine zone at elevations of 6400 to 8000 feet. The soils are forming in recent alluvium derived from basalt and limestone with some influence from calcareous sandstone. The average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature at 20 inches is less than 60 degrees F. The average frost-free period is about 120 to 130 days. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 24 inches and occurs principally as winter snows and as heavy thunderstorms in July and August."
