The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about mid-August to mid-November (about 90 days) and is usually moist the rest of the time.\nDepth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches (25 to 51 centimeters).\nThe particle size control section averages 25 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent rock fragments.  Organic matter is 2 to 3 percent after mixing the upper 18 centimeters of the profile.\nThe A horizon dry color is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 4/2, 4/3, 3/3, or 3/2.
