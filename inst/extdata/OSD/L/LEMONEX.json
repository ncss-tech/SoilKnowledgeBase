  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lemonex series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered mainly from serpentine or ultamafic bedrock with a surface influence of Mazama volcanic ash.  Lemonex soils are on hills and mountains having slopes of 3 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 48 centimeters (19 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C. (43 degrees F.).",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 80 consecutive days during the four-month period following the summer solstice.  Depth to a lithic contact is 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches).  Rock fragments in the upper 50 centimeters (20 inches) of the Bt horizon range from 15 to 35 percent by volume.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon is 25 to 50 centimeters) 10 to 20 inches. Hue is typically 10YR but ranges from 5YR to 5Y.  Base saturation by sum is 80 to 95 percent throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It has 27 to 35 percent clay, 0 to 40 percent stones, 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent gravel.  Volcanic glass ranges from 5 to 20 percent and oxalate extracted Al and one-half iron ranges from 0.2 to 0.5 percent.\nThe B horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 in the upper part and value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 in the lower part.  It has 40 to 60 percent clay, 0 to 15 percent cobbles and 15 to 35 percent gravel.\nThe R horizon varies considerably in color even within a short distance.  The highly fractured serpentine or ultramafic rocks have colors that include greenish black (10GY 2.5/1), dark greenish gray (5GY 4/1), or White (N 8/) with the shiny coating on the fracture layers characteristic of serpentine."

They formed in mixed colluvium and residuum weathered mostly from serpentine or ultramafic bedrock with a surface influence of Mazama Volcanic ash.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation of 41 to 61 centimeters (16 to 24 inches).  Mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C. (40 to 45 degrees F.), mean July temperature is about 13 to 16 degrees C. (56 to 60 degrees F.), and mean January temperature is -3 to -1 degrees C. (27 to 30 degrees F.).

Grell, Overholt, Stussi, and Widows soils are formed over serpentine or ultramafic bedrock whereas Hankins and Klicker soils are formed over basalt.  Hankins soils are over 40 inches deep.  Klicker soils are loamy-skeletal.  Both are found on adjacent side slopes.  Grell and Stussi soils are in range areas on lower hill slopes, are mesic, are loamy-skeletal, and lack an argillic horizon.  Grell soils are lithic.  Overholt soils are shallow to serpentine, are on shoulders and ridgetops adjacent to exposed serpentine, are loamy-skeletal, and lack an argillic horizon.  Widows soils are shallow to serpentine, are on shoulders and ridgetops adjacent to exposed serpentine, and are clayey-skeletal."
