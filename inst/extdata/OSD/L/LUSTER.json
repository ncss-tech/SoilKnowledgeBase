  "OVERVIEW": "The Luster series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Luster soils are on footslopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
