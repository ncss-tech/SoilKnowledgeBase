Where the loess is thin, the Clarinda soils are on secondary interfluves or at the shoulder of side slopes and the Lamoni soils are on side slopes.  Where slopes are long, both Lamoni and Shelby soils are commonly on the same side slope.  On steep slopes, Lamoni soils are usually on the interfluves or shoulders of slopes and the Shelby soils are on the entire side slope.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
