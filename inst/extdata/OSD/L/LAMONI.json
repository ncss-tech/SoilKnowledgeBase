  "REVDATE": "07/2018",
  "STATES": "IA,MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lamoni series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 25 to 50 centimeters of loess or a mixture of loess and pedisediment and the underlying paleosol formed in till.  These soils are on side slopes on dissected till plains.  Slope ranges from 5 to 18 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.",

Where the loess is thin, the Clarinda soils are on secondary interfluves or at the shoulder of side slopes and the Lamoni soils are on side slopes.  Where slopes are long, both Lamoni and Shelby soils are commonly on the same side slope.  On steep slopes, Lamoni soils are usually on the interfluves or shoulders of slopes and the Shelby soils are on the entire side slope.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
