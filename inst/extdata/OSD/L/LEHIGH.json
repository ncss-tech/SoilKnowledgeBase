  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Bedrock is at 40 to 60 inches.  Gravel fragments of porcelanite range from 0 to 45 percent in the A horizon, 5 to 60 percent in individual subhorizons of the B horizon, and 25 to 80 percent in the C horizon. The upper 20 inches of the B horizon averages less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Diabase stones occur in the upper part of the solum in some areas.  The clay fraction includes abundant amounts of kaolinite, moderate amounts of illite, moderate amounts of chlorite and low amounts of vermiculite.  Where unlimed, the reaction in the solum and substratum ranges from very strongly acid through neutral.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y or is neutral, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 4.  Redoximorphic features are found 10 to 18 inches below the soil surface. Low chroma and low value colors are inherited from the dark colored parent material.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Structure is moderate or strong, fine or medium subangular blocky.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y or is neutral, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 3.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Mount Lucas and Passport series are the only competing series in the same family.  Mount Lucas soils have depth greater than 60 inches to bedrock and do not have rock fragments formed from porcelanite.  Passport soils are formed in loamy materials and in the underlying till that contains a strongly developed paleosol in the till. Some pedons from the Passport series have a loess cap that is less than 10 inches thick. The Bogart, Centerburg, Conowingo, Haney, Reaville, Thackery, Tuscola, Vaughnsville, and Williamstown series are in a related family. Bogart, Centerburg, Thackery, Tuscola, Vaughnsville, and Williamstown soils are greater than 60 inches to bedrock. Haney soils do not have rock fragments of porcelanite. Reaville soils have bedrock at less than 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lehigh soils are nearly level to moderately steep soils on hills and low ridges.  The regolith is formed in residuum from porcelanite (metamorphosed shale and sandstone).  The porcelanite areas commonly occur in bands separating areas of diabase and red Triassic sandstone and shale.  Climate is continental with warm summers and cold winters.  Mean annual rainfall ranges from 40 to 48 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 55 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from about 165 to 200 days."

They are also associated with the Legore, Montalto, Mount lucas, Neshaminy, Penn, Readington, and Watchung soils.  Legore, Montalto, Neshaminy, and Penn soils are well drained and do not have mottling in the B horizon.  Watchung soils are poorly drained and have a clayey particle-size control section."

Water table measurements indicate a depth of one-half to three feet during portions of late fall, winter and spring months.  The water table is generally below three feet during the late spring, summer and early fall months."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The low value and low chroma matrix colors given in the typifying pedon and the range of characteristics are due to colors inherited from the parent material and not due to wetness. Base saturation immediately above bedrock is more than 60 percent by sum of cations.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 7 inches (Ap horizon).\nb. Argillic horizon - the zone from about 7 to 28 inches (Bt horizon).\n2007 Revision updates the type location, profile description, competing and geographically associated soils.
