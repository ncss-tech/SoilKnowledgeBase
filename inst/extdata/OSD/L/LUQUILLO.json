  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "GRB",
  "REVDATE": "12/2001",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Luquillo series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on flood plains and low terraces of large streams and rivers.  They formed in unconsolidated Quaternary terrace and bouldery alluvial deposits that weathered from material of sandstone origin.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches and the mean annual temperature 76 degrees F.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",

Rock fragments ranges from 10 to 60 percent, by volume, in the A horizon, 0 to 30 percent, by volume, in the Bw horizons, and from 10 to 65 percent, by volume in the C horizon.  Pebbles, cobbles, stones, and boulders cover 0.01 to more than 50 percent of the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma from 3 to 6.  Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam, clay, their cobbly, stony, or bouldery analogs.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Soft masses of black concretions range from none to common.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, sandy clay, clay, their pebbly or cobbly analogs.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Soft masses of iron accumulation range from none to common.  Texture ranges from loam to clay or their cobbly and stony analogs."

They formed in unconsolidated Quaternary terrace and bouldery alluvial deposits that weathered from material of sandstone origin.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 75 to 85 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 75 to 77 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Coloso, Cristal, and Zarzal soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Coloso soils are on similar to slightly lower positions, have kaolinitic mineralogy, and less stones and boulders on the surface.  Cristal and Zarzal soils are on adjacent higher side slopes and do not flood.  In addition, the somewhat poorly drained Cristal soils have more clay in the control section.  Zarzal soils have more clay in the control section and are Oxisols."
