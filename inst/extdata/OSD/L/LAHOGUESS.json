The mollic epipedon ranges from 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches) in thickness. The series control section ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the upper two parts of the control section and from slightly acid to moderately alkaline and in the lower two parts.\nThe upper part of the series control section (Ap, A, and/or AB horizon) has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loam or silt loam.\nThe second part of the series control section (Bt and/or Btg horizon) has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is loam or clay loam. The average clay content ranges from 20 to 32 percent, and average sand content ranges from 20 to 50 percent.\nThe third part of the series control section (2BCg, 2BC, 2Bt, and/or 2Btg horizon) has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is sandy loam, loam, or loamy sand. The average clay content ranges from 5 to 20 percent, and the average sand content ranges from 40 to 80 percent. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe lower part of the series control section (2C and/or 2Cg horizon) has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 8. It is loamy sand or sand. Sand content averages between 80 and 98 percent. The sand fraction is more than 50 percent medium and coarse sand. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 42.33 micrometers per second) in the solum and high or very high (42.33 to 141.11 micrometers per second) in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate to moderately rapid in the solum and rapid in the underlying material."
