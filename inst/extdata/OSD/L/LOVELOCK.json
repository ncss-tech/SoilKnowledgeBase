  "OVERVIEW": "The Lovelock series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, diatomaceous earth, and volcanic ash. Lovelock soils are on lake plains and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
