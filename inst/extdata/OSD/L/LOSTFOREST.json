  "OVERVIEW": "The Lostforest series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and slope alluvium derived from tuff and tuff-breccia.  Lostforest soils are on structural benches. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
