  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lostforest soils are on structural benches. They formed in volcanic ash and slope alluvium derived from basaltic tuff and tuff-breccia. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,435 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250  mm, with an annual snowfall of about 530 mm. The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
