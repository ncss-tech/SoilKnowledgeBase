The upper 20 inches of the subsoil averages between 18 and 32 percent clay and from 15 to 30 percent very fine sand.  The soil material has value of 3 or less when mixed to a depth of 7 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction ranges from slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk or Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5, and chroma of 2.  Iron accumulations are in shades of brown and iron depletions are in shades of gray.  Peds are coated or partly coated with very dark gray (10YR 3/1), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark gray (10YR 4/1), or black (10YR 2/1) silt coatings or clay films. Calcium carbonate nodules 1 to 5 centimeters in diameter range from 0 to 10 percent.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Btkg or Btg horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Iron accumulations are in shades of brown or olive, and iron depletions are in shades of gray. Calcium carbonate nodules 1 to 5 centimeters in diameter range from 0 to 10 percent.  Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Reaction ranges from neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of  5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  Iron accumulations are in shades of brown or olive, and iron depletions are in shades of gray. Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline through moderately alkaline."
