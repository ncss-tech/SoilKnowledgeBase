(Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)\nAp--0 to 8 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silt loam; weak medium granular structure; friable, many fine roots; few fine black concretions; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)\nBtk--8 to 24 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay loam; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; common medium distinct very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) mottles; firm; common fine roots; few fine black manganese concretions; about 5 percent calcium carbonate concretions that are up to 1 inch in diameter; distinct very dark gray (10YR 3/1) organically stained silt coatings on faces of peds; prominent clay films on faces of peds; fine earth effervesces in dilute HCl in spots; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 35 to more than 80 inches.  The upper 20 inches of the subsoil averages between 18 and 32 percent clay and from 15 to 30 percent very fine sand.  The soil material has value of 3 or less when mixed to a depth of 7 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction ranges from slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk or Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5, and chroma of 2.  Iron accumulations are in shades of brown and iron depletions are in shades of gray.  Peds are coated or partly coated with very dark gray (10YR 3/1), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark gray (10YR 4/1), or black (10YR 2/1) silt coatings or clay films. Calcium carbonate nodules 1 to 5 centimeters in diameter range from 0 to 10 percent.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Btkg or Btg horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Iron accumulations are in shades of brown or olive, and iron depletions are in shades of gray. Calcium carbonate nodules 1 to 5 centimeters in diameter range from 0 to 10 percent.  Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Reaction ranges from neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of  5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  Iron accumulations are in shades of brown or olive, and iron depletions are in shades of gray. Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline through moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.  Galvez soils are in a closely related family.  They are on more convex positions on the natural levee and do not have a mollic epipedon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Loreauville soils are on the level to nearly level slightly convex natural levees. Slope gradients are dominantly from 0 to 1/2 percent. They formed in loamy Mississippi River sediments.  Mean annual air temperature is about 68 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 64 inches near the type location."

Baldwin soils are on lower positions on the natural levee and have more than 35 percent clay throughout the upper part of the solum.  Iberia soils are on lower, backswamp positions, and have more than 60 percent clay throughout the upper part of the solum.  Jeanerette soils are on more concave positions, have a mollic epipedon more than 10 inches thick, and formed in water re-worked loess with less than 15 percent very fine sand throughout the upper part of the subsoil."
