  "OVERVIEW": "The Lynchlake series consists of very deep, well drained soils on lake terraces and moraines. They formed in glaciolacustrine sediments or till with minor amounts of volcanic ash mixed in the surface layers. Permeability is moderately slow. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. The average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is about 28 inches.",
