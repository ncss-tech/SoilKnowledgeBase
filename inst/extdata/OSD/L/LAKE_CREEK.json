  "STATES": "CO,MT,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lake Creek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone, shale, and argillite.  Lake Creek soils occur on uplands, hillslopes, mountain slopes, and landslide deposits.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
