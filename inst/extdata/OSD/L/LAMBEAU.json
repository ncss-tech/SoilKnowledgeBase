  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the loess ranges from 25 to 59 inches.  Depth to the paralithic contact with siliceous sandstone ranges from 45 to 80 inches, but is typically over 60 inches.  Coarse fragments are absent in the loess mantle.  The particle-size control section averages 20 to 25 percent clay.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nWhere present, the E horizon has value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 29 percent.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the channery analogs.  Loamy fine sand and loamy sand is also included if less than 6 inches thick.  Reaction ranges from  very strongly acid to slightly acid.  Volume of channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is sand, fine sand, or the channery analogs.  Thin strata 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick of loamy sand and loamy fine sand are common.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.  Volume of channers ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  Volume of sandstone flagstones range from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe underlying bedrock consists of siliceous sandstone and has color similar to the 3C horizon above.  Narrow joints containing residuum are common in the sandstone.  The sandstone can be dug with a spade, easily in some pedons, but with difficulty in others."

The Baraboo and Dubuque soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Blackhammer, Camden, Fayette, Flagg, Greenridge, Jemerson, Martinsburg, Menfro, Navlys, Pepin, Piscasaw, Ridgway, Rozetta, Ruma, Russell, Seaton, St. Charles, Stookey, Sylvan and Yellowriver soils do not have sand or fine sand in the lower part of the series control section.  Bertrand and Jackson soils have stratified loamy and sandy alluvium in the lower part of the series control section.  La Farge soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Palsgrove soils have a lithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Rush soils have carbonates in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lambeau soils are on hills on highly dissected bedrock controlled uplands.  Slopes range from 6 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in loess and in the underlying slope alluvium and sandy residuum.  Residuum is weathered from the underlying Wonewoc sandstone.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 780 to 900 feet."
