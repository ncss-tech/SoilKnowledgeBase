Mean annual soil temperature is 64 degrees to 68 degrees F. Electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio and gypsum content are affected by agricultural practices and the depth to a high water table.\nThe A horizon has color of 5Y 5/2, 6/1; 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2, 5/4, 6/2, 6/4, 7/2; 10YR 4/3, 6/3, 6/2, 5/2, 5/3 or 4/3. Moist color is 5Y 3/2; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2, 4/4, 5/2; 10YR 4/2 or 4/3. Organic matter content is less than 2 percent. Texture is fine sandy loam, silt loam or clay loam. Clay content is 8 to 35 percent. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 0 to 5 percent. It is usually slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent with disseminated carbonates, but is noneffervescent in some pedons. Electrical conductivity is 1 to 30 decisiemens per meter. Sodium adsorption ratio is 2 to 200. Reaction is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.\nThe B horizon has color of 5Y 3/2, 5/2, 6/1, 6/2, 6/3; 2.5Y 5/2, 5/4, 6/2, 6/4, 7/2; 10YR 4/3, 6/3, 5/2 or 4/2.

Clay content is 33 to 55 percent and averages 35 to 55 percent clay. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 0 to 5 percent. The Btkn horizon is slightly effervescent to violently effervescent. Carbonates are disseminated or segregated as threads and soft masses. The Btny horizon, that does not have carbonates, is not present in some pedons. Gypsum is not present in some pedons. Electrical conductivity is 1 to 30 percent. Sodium adsorption ratio is 13 to 200. Some pedons have redoximorphic features in the lower part of the Btkn horizon. Reaction is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has color of 5Y 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 8/1, 8/2; 2.5Y 5/2, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4; 10YR 6/3, 6/4 or 5/2.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Armpup and Oban series. Armpup soils (MLRA 30), on pediment remnants and ballena toe slopes, have a paralithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches and have up to 70 percent coarse fragments in the Btkn horizon. Oban soils (MLRA 30), on valley troughs and basins, have gravel content as high as 25 percent in C horizons, have vesicular pores just below the upper plates in pedons with platy structure near the surface, have an E horizon in some pedons, occur at elevations of 2,300 to 2,500 feet and have mean annual precipitation of about 5 inches."

These soils formed in mixed alluvium dominantly from sedimentary and/or igneous rocks. Elevation is 190 to 1,000 feet. The climate is arid and has long, hot, dry summers and cool, somewhat moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches. Mean January temperature is about 50 degrees F.; mean July temperature is about 83 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 62 to 66 degrees F. The frost-free season is 220 to 300 days."

Slow permeability is usually present in areas that have been highly modified by deep ripping, applications of soil amendments such as gypsum or sulfur, and applications of irrigation water that has reduced the salinity and sodicity."
