  "OVERVIEW": "The Lethent series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on low lying alluvial fans, fan remnants, basins and basin rims. These soils formed in mixed alluvium dominantly from sedimentary and/or igneous rocks. Slope is 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",

Mean annual soil temperature is 64 degrees to 68 degrees F. Electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio and gypsum content are affected by agricultural practices and the depth to a high water table.\nThe A horizon has color of 5Y 5/2, 6/1; 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2, 5/4, 6/2, 6/4, 7/2; 10YR 4/3, 6/3, 6/2, 5/2, 5/3 or 4/3. Moist color is 5Y 3/2; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2, 4/4, 5/2; 10YR 4/2 or 4/3. Organic matter content is less than 2 percent. Texture is fine sandy loam, silt loam or clay loam. Clay content is 8 to 35 percent.

Clay content is 33 to 55 percent and averages 35 to 55 percent clay. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 0 to 5 percent. The Btkn horizon is slightly effervescent to violently effervescent. Carbonates are disseminated or segregated as threads and soft masses. The Btny horizon, that does not have carbonates, is not present in some pedons. Gypsum is not present in some pedons. Electrical conductivity is 1 to 30 percent. Sodium adsorption ratio is 13 to 200. Some pedons have redoximorphic features in the lower part of the Btkn horizon.
