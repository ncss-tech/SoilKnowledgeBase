  "OVERVIEW": "The Lothair series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terrraces.  Slopes are   0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12   inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
