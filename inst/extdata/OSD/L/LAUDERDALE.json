  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid, except the surface layer in areas that have been limed.  Fragments of sandstone, siltstone, or shale range from few to as much as 15 percent of the volume of the A and B horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Texture is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or cobbly fine sandy loam.\nThe thin E horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5\nor 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It has the same texture range as the\nA horizon.\nThe Bt horizon commonly has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6 and less commonly hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6; mottles, if present, are in shades of brown or yellow.  Texture is silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  The Bt horizon has 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe Cr horizon most commonly is alternating, horizontally bedded, soft to hard claystone, siltstone, and sandstone, but in some pedons it is thick bedded sandstone or siltstone with a hardness of about 2 on Mohs' scale."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Closely related series are the Cantuche, Mountainburg, Saffell, Talledega, and Tallapoosa.  The Cantuche soils do not have a diagnostic horizon and have weathered, stratified claystone, siltstone, and sandstone bedrock at a depth of less than 20 inches.  Mountainburg, Saffell, and Talledega soils are loamy-skeletal in the particle-size control section.  Also, Mountainburg soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 20 inches; Saffell soils have a thicker solum; Talledega soils have a discontinuous argillic horizon in each pedon and a shallow lithic contact in part of each pedon.  Saluda soils have a mesic temperature regime and weathered saprolite from granite at a depth of 10 to 20 inches.  Tallapoosa soils have micaceous mineralogy and an argillic horizon that is less than 10 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Lauderdale soils are in rugged, dissected uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area.  These gently sloping to steep soils are on ridgetops and hillsides; slope gradients range from 2 to 30 percent.  The soil mainly formed in alternating, horizontally bedded soft to hard sandstone, shale, and siltstone.  Some areas are underlain by thick bedded sandstone or siltstone.  The climate is warm and humid.  Near the type location the mean annual temperature is 64 degrees Fahrenheit, and the mean annual precipitation is 52 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Cadeville, Eustis, Ruston, Smithdale, Susquehanna, and Sweatman soils; all of these soils have a solum thicker than 20 inches.  Cadeville, Susquehanna, and Sweatman soils, which have 35 to 60 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon, are on hillsides and footslopes.  Eustis soils, which have a solum more than 60 inches thick and A and E horizons that are sand to loamy fine sand texture, are on associated ridgetops.  Ruston and Smithdale soils, which formed in thick deposits of loamy sediments, are in similar positions as the Lauderdale soils."
