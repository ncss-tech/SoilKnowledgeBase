  "OVERVIEW": "The Lawrence series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils with a fragipan in the subsoil.  The soils formed in a silty mantle of loess or alluvium, colluvium, and the underlying residuum of limestone on nearly level stream terraces, alluvial fans, and on nearly level concave uplands.  Slopes commonly range from 0 to 3 percent, but can extend up to 6 percent.",
