  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 60 to more than 200 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 18 to 32 inches.  Reaction ranges from very stongly acid to slightly acid, except in the BC and 2C horizon it can range to neutral. Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent throughout.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.\nTexture is silt loam.\nThe BA, BE, or E horizons, where present, have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and hue of 4 or less.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to  6.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray and brown range from few to many.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 5Y to 7.5YR, value 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8; or it is neutral and has value 5 to 7. The horizon has few to many redoximophic features in shades of gray and brown. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam\nThe B't or BC horizons have hue of 5Y to 5YR, value 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8 or is neutral and has value 5 to 7.  Texture ranges from silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay.\nThe 2C horizon of some pedons is residuum from limestone, or are stratified layers of sand, silt, or clay below a depth of 4O inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family. Series in closely related families are Chalfont, Gudgel, Penlaw, and Robbs series.  Chalfont and Gudgel soils  soils formed in a loess mantle and residuum of sandstone and shale.  Penlaw soils are neutral to moderately acid throughout.  Robbs soils have formed in 4 feet or more of loess, otherwise they are very close competitors."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in mixed alluvium or colluvium derived from soils formed in residuum from limestone, shales, siltstone, and sandstone.  Near the type location, the average annual temperature is 55.4 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 43.02 inches."

Elk and Crider soils lack fragipans and are well drained.  Otwood and Nicholson soils lack gray mottles in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon. Robertsville soils are poorly drained.  Huntington, Newark, and Nolin soils lack argillic horizons and a fragipan. Lowell, Hagerstown, Baxter, and Eden soils have argillic horizons with more than 35 percent clay, and lack fragipans."
