  "OVERVIEW": "The Lawrence series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils with a fragipan in the subsoil.  The soils formed in a silty mantle of loess or alluvium, colluvium, and the underlying residuum of limestone on nearly level stream terraces, alluvial fans, and on nearly level concave uplands.  Slopes commonly range from 0 to 3 percent, but can extend up to 6 percent.",

Reaction ranges from very stongly acid to slightly acid, except in the BC and 2C horizon it can range to neutral. Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent throughout.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.\nTexture is silt loam.\nThe BA, BE, or E horizons, where present, have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and hue of 4 or less.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to  6.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray and brown range from few to many.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 5Y to 7.5YR, value 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8; or it is neutral and has value 5 to 7.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family. Series in closely related families are Chalfont, Gudgel, Penlaw, and Robbs series.  Chalfont and Gudgel soils  soils formed in a loess mantle and residuum of sandstone and shale.  Penlaw soils are neutral to moderately acid throughout.  Robbs soils have formed in 4 feet or more of loess, otherwise they are very close competitors."
