  "OVERVIEW": "The Langless series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Langless soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
