  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 48 to 70 inches.  Soil reaction of the 0a horizon is less than 4.5 in 0.01M calcium chloride.  Soil reaction is very strongly acid to strongly acid in the A horizon, strongly acid to neutral in the upper part of the Btg horizon, and from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part of the Btg horizon and the BCg and Cg horizons.\nThe 0a horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  Fiber content ranges from about 25 to 45 percent before rubbing but is less than 15 percent after rubbing.  Organic matter content is more than 30 percent.  Texture is muck.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 2 or less; or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  Texture is loamy sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or loamy sand.\nThe upper part of the Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or less; or it is neutral with value of 3 to 5.  Texture is sandy clay or clay.\nThe lower part of the Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or less; or it is neutral with value of 1 or less.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of yellow, brown, or red range from none to common.  Texture is sandy clay or clay.\nThe BCg horizon, where present, has the same range of colors and textures as the lower part of the Btg horizon.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or less; or it is neutral with value of 1 or less.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of yellow, brown, or red range from none to common.  Texture is sandy clay or clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bivans, Crowley, Paisley, and Wyick in the same family.  The poorly drained Bivans soils are on upland areas.  The somewhat poorly drained Crowley and Wyick soils are west of the Mississippi River, are in areas of lower rainfall, and are dry in most years during July and August.  The poorly drained Paisley soils are on slightly higher positions and are underlain by calcareous material."

They formed in beds of clayey marine sediments.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 71 to 73 degrees F."

The poorly drained Wauberg soils are on higher positions, have sandy surface and surface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness, and have fine-loamy argillic horizons with siliceous mineralogy."

Some areas have been drained and are used for truck crops or improved pasture.  Vegetation is dominantly a mixture of wetland grasses, herbs, and shrubs, which include bulrush, maidencane, cordgrass, cattails, cutgrass, buttonbush, goldenrod, flatsedge, and in places, some waxmyrtle and willow.  A few areas have scattered pond cypress and water tupelo."

The water table is within 10 inches of the surface for about 6 months or more during the year.\nThese soils were formerly mapped as a variant of the Emeralda series.  They would be classified as Histic Albaqualfs if the subgroup was in Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
