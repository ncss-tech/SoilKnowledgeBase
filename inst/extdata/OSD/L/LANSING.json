The soil ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the Ap and B horizons and neutral to moderately alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E or BE horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. They are fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction. They have weak platy or subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bt/E horizon has properties like the E horizon on exteriors of peds and like the Bt horizon in interiors of peds.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine earth fraction with weighted average of 18 to 28 percent clay. It has weak through strong, medium or coarse subangular blocky structure and/or is prismatic. Consistence is friable or firm. It has few to common redoximorphic features below a depth of 100 cm (40 in) in some pedons.\nThe BC horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is subangular blocky or prismatic, or it is massive. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe C or Cd horizon in some pedons, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is fine sandy loam, silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction. It is massive or has weak or moderate, medium or thick plate-like divisions. It is firm or very firm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Wampsville soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section. Fairport, Wassaic, and Yunenyeti soils have bedrock within a depth of 100 cm (40 in).\nThe Aurora, Cazenovia, Conesus, Danley, Hilton, Lima, Madrid, Mohawk and Nunda series are similar soils in related families. Aurora, Conesus, Danley, and Nunda soils have redoximorphic features with chroma of 2 or less in the upper 25 cm (10 in) of the argillic horizon. Cazenovia soils have more than 28 percent clay in the Bt horizon. Hilton and Lima soils have redox features within a depth of 100 cm (40 in). Madrid soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections. Mohawk soils have Ap horizons with moist color value of 3 or less."

The soil formed in till of late Wisconsin age derived from shale, limestone, fine grained sandstone and siltstone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 787 to 1448 mm (31 to 57 in), mean annual temperature ranges from about 5 degrees C to 10 degrees C (41 to 50 degrees F), and the mean frost-free season ranges from 100 to 190 days.

Appleton, Conesus, Kendaia, and Lyons soils are the progressively wetter members of the same drainage sequence. Arkport and Colonie soils formed in nearby sandy deltaic deposits. Aurora soils have bedrock within a depth of 100 cm (40 in). Howard soils formed in outwash materials."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: After a review of the use of the Lansing and Ontario series for the range of the color hue in the Bt, the requirement that at least one subhorizon be 7.5YR or redder was added to Ontario and the competing series section of Lansing and Ontario were adjusted to reflect the change.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 15 cm (6 in) (Ap horizon).\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 43 to 107 cm (17 to 42 in) (Bt/E and Bt horizons).\n3. Glossic feature - interfingering of albic material around peds in the upper part of the argillic horizon (Bt/E horizon).\n4. Mean annual soil temperature less than 10 degrees C.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
