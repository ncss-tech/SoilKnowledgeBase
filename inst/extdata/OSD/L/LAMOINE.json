  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 41 to 140 cm. Depth to bedrock is more than 152 cm. Rock fragment content throughout the soil is less than 5 percent by volume. Stones cover from 0 to 3 percent of the surface. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the surface, unless limed, from strongly acid to neutral in the subsoil, and from moderately acid to neutral in the substratum.\nSome pedons have an O horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, with value and chroma of 2 to 4. Undisturbed areas have an A horizon 3 to 15 cm thick, that has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 to 4. They are silt loam or silty clay loam. They have moderate or strong, very fine to medium granular structure. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 7 and chroma of 2 to 6. It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay. It has weak to strong, fine or medium granular, very fine to coarse subangular blocky, or medium or thick platy structure, or has primary structure that is coarse or very coarse prismatic. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 4. It is silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay. It has blocky or platy structure or has primary structure that is prismatic. Consistence is firm or very firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y or is neutral, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 4. It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. It has blocky, platy, or prismatic structure, all of which are considered inherited, or the horizon is massive. Consistence is firm or very firm. Common or many black to dark reddish brown oxide coats are on faces of peds. Some pedons have films on faces of peds that appear to be fine silt."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in the same family. The Roundabout, Swanton and Swanville series are similar soils in related families. Roundabout soils have a coarse-silty particle-size class. Swanton soils have a coarse-loamy over clayey particle-size class, and Swanville soils have a fine-silty particle-size class."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lamoine soils are on coastal lowlands and river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed in medium, moderately fine and fine textured glaciolacustrine or glaciomarine sediments. The climate is humid and cool temperate. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1219 mm, and mean annual temperature ranges from 6 to 8 degrees C. The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 2 to 274 meters above mean sea level."

The moderately well or somewhat poorly drained Boothbay soils are in similar and higher positions on the landscape and have a fine-silty particle-size class. The moderately well drained Buxton soils are in higher positions on the landscape. The poorly drained Scantic and Swanville soils are in lower positions on the landscape."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: 1. This revision reflects a change in classification from Aeric Haplaquepts to Aeric Epiaquepts to conform with Keys to Taxonomy, sixth edition, 1994.\n2. Some soils formerly mapped as Buxton will now be included with the Lamoine series.\n3. Some pedons have been described with a bisequum profile.\n4. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 18 cm (Ap horizon).\nb. Cambic horizon - the zone from 18 to 43 cm (Bw1, Bw2, and Bw3 horizons).\nc. Aeric feature - matrix with chroma of 3 or more between the A or Ap horizon and 76 cm.\nd. Aquic conditions-Redoximorphic features at 18 cm.\ne. Episaturation - a perched water table.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil interpretation record numbers for the Lamoine series are: Lamoine, ME0108; Lamoine, stony, ME0130.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
