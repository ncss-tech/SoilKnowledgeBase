  "OVERVIEW": "The Lamoine series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in glaciolacustrine or glaciomarine deposits on coastal lowlands and river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow in the surface horizon, moderately slow or slow in the upper part of the subsoil, and slow or very slow in the lower part of the subsoil and in the substratum. Mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm at the type location.",

Some soils formerly mapped as Buxton will now be included with the Lamoine series.\n3. Some pedons have been described with a bisequum profile.\n4. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 18 cm (Ap horizon).\nb. Cambic horizon - the zone from 18 to 43 cm (Bw1, Bw2, and Bw3 horizons).\nc. Aeric feature - matrix with chroma of 3 or more between the A or Ap horizon and 76 cm.\nd. Aquic conditions-Redoximorphic features at 18 cm.\ne. Episaturation - a perched water table.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil interpretation record numbers for the Lamoine series are: Lamoine, ME0108; Lamoine, stony, ME0130.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
