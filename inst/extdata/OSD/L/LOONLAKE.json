  "OVERVIEW": "The Loonlake series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over glacial outwash.  These soils are on stream terraces and outwash plains in valleys.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
