  "OVERVIEW": "The Langwell series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in granitic or metamorphic residuum. The Langwell soils are on mountains, hills, and pediments. Slope ranges from 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F.",

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Delgado, Splanod, Tidwell, and Trigger series. Delgado and Splanod soils form from sandstones and shales. In addition, Delgado soils are deeper to bedrock. Splanod soils have hues of 2.5YR and 5YR. Tidwell and Trigger soils are derived from sedimentary rocks. In addition, Tidwell soils have redder hues and Trigger soils have a MAST of 61 to 64 and the moisture control section that is dry from May through October."

Elevations are 1,900 to 3,800 feet. The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and cool winters. Most precipitation comes in the winter but in some areas it is sporadic. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 7 inches. The mean annual temperature is 61 to 70 degrees F. Mean July temperature is about 78 degrees F., and mean January temperature is about 42 degrees F. The frost-free season is 240 to 340 days."

They have a sandy particle-size control section and are deep or very deep. Dalvord soils are found on similar positions and have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section. Twobitter soils are on fan remnants with a patina surface. They are deep, have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section, and an argillic horizon."
