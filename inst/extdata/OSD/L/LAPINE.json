The soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days. Solum thickness is 14 to 35 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Depth to loamy buried soils is 40 to over 60 inches. Paragravel pumice fragments are 2 millimeters to 4 centimeters in diameter average 35 to 85 percent in the 0 to 40-inch particle-size control section. The fine earth fraction is vesicular ash predominantly of coarse sand or loamy coarse sand. Field estimated clay content is 0 to 5 percent. The solum has andic soil properties with 70 to 100 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate, phosphate retention of 25 to 50 percent, acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, 15 bar water content of 3 to 12 percent on both dried and undried samples and moist bulk density of 0.70 to 1.00 grams per cubic centimeter.\nSome pedons have an O horizon up to 3 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry. It is ashy coarse sandy loam, ashy loamy sand or ashy loamy coarse sand. It contains 15 to 35 percent paragravel pumice fragments. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 8 moist, 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 0 to 8 moist and 0 to 6 dry. Colors mainly are due to uncoated mineral grains. It is very paragravelly or extremely paragravelly ashy coarse sand or ashy loamy coarse sand with strata of paragravelly ashy coarse sand or ashy coarse sand. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 8 moist, 6 to 8 dry and chroma of 0 to 4 moist and dry. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline. Glass content is 70 to 100 percent.\nThe buried soil when present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam or silty clay loam. Some pedons contain relic redoximorphic features.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline."
