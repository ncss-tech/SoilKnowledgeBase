  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to carbonate accumulation range from 7 to 12 inches.  Depth to sandstone ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 degrees to 42 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is 60 degrees to 62 degrees F.  The moisture control section is dry more than half and less than three fourths of the time the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is warmer than 41 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  When mollic colors occur they lack the required thickness to qualify as mollisols.  Gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It commonly is light loam and less commonly fine sandy loam, sandy loam, gravelly loam, or cobbly fine sandy loam.  The Cca horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 21 percent, with 0 to 20 percent as pebbles and 0 to 10 percent as cobbles.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It commonly is light loam or fine sandy loam and less commonly sandy loam or gravelly loam.  The lower part of the C horizon commonly is massive or has rock structure and less commonly has subangular blocky structure.  The C horizon is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent, with 0 to 20 percent as pebbles and 0 to 5 percent as cobbles."

The soils formed in residuum derived from red and buff colored sandstone.  The climate is arid.  The average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 38 degrees to 40 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 58 degrees to 60 degrees F.  Freeze-free season is 55 to 80 days."
