  "OVERVIEW": "The Leighcan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till, slope alluvium, or colluvium from acid igneous rocks.  Leighcan soils are on mountain slopes and have slopes of 0 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 32 degrees F.",

Laboratory data suggests this but is inconclusive.  The isotic mineralogy class is a realistic possibility for this series and needs further study.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Series classified according to Eighth Edition, 1998"
