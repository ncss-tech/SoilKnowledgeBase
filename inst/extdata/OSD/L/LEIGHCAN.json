Laboratory data suggests this but is inconclusive.  The isotic mineralogy class is a realistic possibility for this series and needs further study.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Series classified according to Eighth Edition, 1998\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This series was characterized by the National Soil Survey Lab, soil survey sample number S84CO-105-004.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
