    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. The soil is dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days in the moisture control section following summer solstice. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 16 inches thick. The particle-size control section is 15 to 30 percent hard rock fragments, 10 to 50 percent paragravel fragments and averages 18 to 27 percent clay.  Base saturation of the solum is 75 to 100 percent and a significant amount of the bases are attributed to the soft fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4. It has granular or subangular blocky structure. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 3 through 6. It is gravelly clay loam or gravelly loam. It is moderately acid to neutral.  It has 20 to 30 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR and 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 through 6. It is gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam, or gravelly coarse sandy loam. It is slightly acid or neutral."

The soils formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt or flow breccia. The soils are in a mild marine climate and have cool, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches. Average January temperature is 33 degrees to 36 degrees F.; average July temperature is 55 degrees to 58 degrees F.; and mean annual temperature is 46 degrees to 48 degrees F. Frost-free season is 150 to 190 days."
