  "OVERVIEW": "The Louella series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from basalt and flow breccia. Louella soils are on mountain sides and have slopes of 10 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The soil is dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days in the moisture control section following summer solstice. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 16 inches thick. The particle-size control section is 15 to 30 percent hard rock fragments, 10 to 50 percent paragravel fragments and averages 18 to 27 percent clay.  Base saturation of the solum is 75 to 100 percent and a significant amount of the bases are attributed to the soft fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4. It has granular or subangular blocky structure. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 3 through 6. It is gravelly clay loam or gravelly loam. It is moderately acid to neutral.  It has 20 to 30 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR and 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 through 6. It is gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam, or gravelly coarse sandy loam. It is slightly acid or neutral."
