  "OVERVIEW": "The Lowerbluff series consists of shallow, well drained soils on ridgetops of plateaus. Lowerbluff soils formed in mixed volcanic ash, loess, and colluvium derived from basalt and metavolcanics. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches. The particle-size control section has 10 to 18 percent clay, 0 to 30 percent rock fragments, 1 to 2 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, and 15 to 30 percent volcanic glass. Soil reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid. Base saturation (sum) is 50 to 75 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry. It is ashy silt loam or gravelly ashy fine sandy loam with 10 to 15 percent clay. It has 0 to 20 percent rock fragments with 0 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry. It is ashy silt loam, gravelly ashy silt loam, ashy fine sandy loam, or gravelly ashy fine sandy loam with 10 to 18 percent clay.
