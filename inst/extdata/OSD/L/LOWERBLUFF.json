The particle-size control section has 10 to 18 percent clay, 0 to 30 percent rock fragments, 1 to 2 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, and 15 to 30 percent volcanic glass. Soil reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid. Base saturation (sum) is 50 to 75 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry. It is ashy silt loam or gravelly ashy fine sandy loam with 10 to 15 percent clay. It has 0 to 20 percent rock fragments with 0 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry.
