The soil moisture regime is typic aridic.\nMean annual soil temperature: 59 to 67 degrees F.\nDepth to the calcic horizon: 16 to 40 inches\nThe control section is most commonly stratified with layers of loam, fine sandy loam, and sandy clay loam. It averages between 18 and 27 percent clay and from 45 to 60 percent fine and coarser sand. The soils contain from 5 to 20 percent gravel throughout the profile. In some pedons, the gravel content increases to 30 percent below a depth of 40 inches.\nA horizon\nHue: 5YR or 7.5YR\nValue: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist\nChroma: 3 through 6\nTexture: fine sandy loam, but is silty clay loam where irrigation water has deposited silty sediments\nReaction: moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline\nEffervescence: slightly to strongly effervescent.\nBw horizon\nHue: 5YR or 2.5YR\nValue: 4 or 5 dry\nChroma: of 4 through 6\nBk horizon\nHue: 5YR or 2.5YR\nValue: 4 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist\nChroma: 3 through 6\nReaction: moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline\nEffervescence: strongly to violently effervescent\nGypsum: Small gypsum flecks and crystals are in the lower horizons of some pedons.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bridge, Chutum, Deltajo, Sotim, and Turney series. A potential competitor that does not yet have CEA class is the Weedpatch series. Bridge soils are moderately deep over tuff and ash, and have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR in the 10 to 40 inch control section.  Chutum soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 69 to 72 degrees F.  Deltajo soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Turney soils have noncontinuous weakly cemented calcic horizons.  Weedpatch soils have soils temperatures above 47 degrees F. in January and February. In addition, Weedpatch soils are in the San Joaquin Valley (MLRA 17) receive mostly winter precipitation and are usually dry from April through November."

These soils formed in mixed alluvium from sandstone, shale, and limestone. The mean annual temperature is 57 to 67 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 80 to 84 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches. The frost-free period ranges from 190 to 195 days."

Nikey soils have coarse-loamy control sections. Junction and Tobler soils have fine sandy loam control sections and lack calcic horizons.  Leeds and St. George soils lack calcic horizons, and have stratified loam, silt loam, and light sandy clay loam control sections."
