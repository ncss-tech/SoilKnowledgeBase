The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days during summer and fall. Solum thickness ranges from 26 to 40 inches. The particle-size control section has 30 to 60 percent volcanic glass, acid oxalate extractable Al plus  Fe of 2.0 to 3.0 percent, 15-bar moisture of 10 to 12 percent, and a moist bulk density of 0.85 to 1.10 g/cc; dominated by rock fragments of gabbro, diabase, and serpentized Teanaway basalt origin.\nThe A horizon has a chroma of 2 or 3 moist. Soil reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist. Texture is very cobbly or extremely cobbly ashy sandy loam and averages 20 to 40 percent gravel, 25 to 35 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry. It averages 20 to 40 percent gravel, 30 to 50 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lemah soils are on mountain side slopes and have slopes of 60 to 90 percent. Elevation ranges from 2,700 to 4,000 feet. The soils developed in colluvium from hard Swauk sandstone mixed with volcanic ash. Rock fragments are angular light gray (5Y 7/1) fresh face quartz sandstone with a pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) weathering rhine. It can barely be chipped by a rock hammer. The soils are in a marine influenced climate with cool, dry summers and cool, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 80 inches. The mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is about 61 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. The growing season at 28 degrees F. is 130 to 170 days."
