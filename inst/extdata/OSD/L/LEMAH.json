  "OVERVIEW": "The Lemah series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium from sandstone mixed with volcanic ash. Lemah soils are on mountain side slopes. Slopes are 60 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 65 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The soils developed in colluvium from hard Swauk sandstone mixed with volcanic ash. Rock fragments are angular light gray (5Y 7/1) fresh face quartz sandstone with a pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) weathering rhine. It can barely be chipped by a rock hammer. The soils are in a marine influenced climate with cool, dry summers and cool, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 80 inches. The mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is about 61 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. The growing season at 28 degrees F. is 130 to 170 days."
