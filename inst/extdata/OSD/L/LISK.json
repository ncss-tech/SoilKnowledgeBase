  "OVERVIEW": "The Lisk series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits and sandy alluvium derived from weakly consolidated, calcareous sandstone.  These soils are in swales, alluvial fans, sedimentary plains, and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
