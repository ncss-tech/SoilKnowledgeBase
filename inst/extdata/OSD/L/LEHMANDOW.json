  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Lehmandow soils occur in seep areas and on stream terraces. They formed in alluvium over till derived mainly from quartzite, with minor amounts of limestone and granite. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 2,130 to 2,950 meters. The climate is dry-subhumid with cool moist winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days."

Brokit soils have a strongly contrasting particle-size control section with 12 to 20 percent clay in the upper part and 3 to 10 percent clay in the lower part. Glideski soils have argillic horizons and are well drained, and occur on higher stream terraces. Jumble soils are have ochric epipedons, cambic horizons, horizons with thin lamellae, and occur on adjacent moraines.  Lemcave soils are sandy-skeletal, have ochric epipedons, and occur on adjacent moraines."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 15 to 30 cm (very shallow free water occurrence class) between March and May. Cumulative annual duration class is common. These soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for brief periods between March and September."
