  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 36 to 43 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 52 to 56 degrees F.  These soils are usually noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent in all subhorizons of the argillic horizon.  Depth to the sandy- skeletal 2C horizon ranges from 24 to 55 inches.  Depth to the top of the argillic horizon is less than 24 inches and depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 17 to 55 inches.  Rock fragments average 35 to 75 percent in the 10- to 40-inch section and are mainly 1/4 to 10 inches in diameter.  These soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section for some period of nearly every year.\nThe A horizon, if present, has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It ranges from moderately acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically sandy clay loam, but averages 18 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 30 percent silt, and 40 to 75 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  This horizon ranges from moderately acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5Y to 7.5YR.  Subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  This horizon is very gravelly or very cobbly loamy sand or sand.  It ranges from moderately acid to mildly alkaline."

Agneston, Cloud Peak, Gambler, Hyattville, Kebler, Lake Creek, Lakehelen, Lulude, and Trebor soils have a lithic contact at a depth of less than 40 inches.  Cundiyo and MacFarlane soils have less than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Angostura, Duchesne, Frisco, Granile, Hollandlake, Leadville, MacFarlane, and Tolvar soils lack a sandy-skeletal 2C horizon above a depth of 40 inches.  Needleton soils have hues of 5YR and redder in the Bt horizon.  Angostura soils have rock fragments that are larger than 10 inches.  Granile soils have an argillic horizon of loam or clay loam, with less than 35 percent fine and coarser sand, and the Tolvar soils have \"hard setting\" properties when dry. Leadville soils have hue of 5YR and redder.  Presa soils lack a mixed E/B horizon. Tigeron and Worock soils lack extremely gravelly sandy C horizons, and Tigeron soils are dominantly strongly acid in the A and B horizons.  Tamarron and Guffy soils have a paralithic contact above 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Larand soils are on alluvial fans and mountain side slopes. Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  The soil formed in glacial till or glacial outwash materials which in some places has a thin eolian mantle.  At the type location these soils occur at an elevation of 8,740 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 18 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer. The average temperature ranges from 35 to 42 degrees F."
