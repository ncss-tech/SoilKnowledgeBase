  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Larand series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till or glacial outwash materials derived from granitic and metamorphic rocks.  Larand soils are on alluvial fans and mountain side slopes. Slopes are 2 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.",
