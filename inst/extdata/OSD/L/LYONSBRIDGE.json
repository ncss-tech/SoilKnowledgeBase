  "OVERVIEW": "The Lyonsbridge series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and/or lake sediments.  These soils occur on alluvial fans, fan remnants and lakebeds. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 390 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
