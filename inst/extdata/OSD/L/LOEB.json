  "OVERVIEW": "The Loeb series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types. Loeb soils are on broad ridgetops of coastal hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 2800 110 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Loeb soils are on stable broad ridgetops of coastal hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium residuum derived dominantly from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types of the Dothan Formation.  Elevations are 60 meters to 396 meters (200 to 1,300 feet).  The climate is humid, characterized by warm wet winters and warm moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 2286 to 3302(90 to 130 inches).  The mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees centigrade (52 to 57 degrees F).   The frost-free period is 240 to 300 days."
