Bullgulch and Hunterscove soils have a mean annual soil temperature less than 54 degrees F.  In addition, Bullgulch soils have an umbric epipedon 20 to 30 inches thick and hue of 10YR throughout the Bt horizon.  Hunterscove soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Macklyn soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Quinliven soils have an ochric epipedon (E horizon), and are moderately well drained with redox depletions occurring below 30 inches.  Vandamme soils have an ochric epipedon and lack coarse fragments greater than 3 inches in diameter or gravelly textures in the argillic horizon.  Wadecreek soils have a mean annual soil temperature less than 54 degrees F. and redox depletions within the lower Bt horizon.  Winchuck soils average greater than 45 percent clay in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Loeb soils are on stable broad ridgetops of coastal hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium residuum derived dominantly from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types of the Dothan Formation.  Elevations are 60 meters to 396 meters (200 to 1,300 feet).  The climate is humid, characterized by warm wet winters and warm moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 2286 to 3302(90 to 130 inches).  The mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees centigrade (52 to 57 degrees F).   The frost-free period is 240 to 300 days."
