  "OVERVIEW": "The Louin series consists of deep somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in clayey material in uplands and stream terraces of the Blackland Prairie Major Land Resource Area.  Permeability is very slow.  These are nearly level soils on broad slopes that have gilgai microrelief.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the A and Bw horizons and ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline in the C horizon.  The 10- to 40-inch particle-size  control section has from 40 to 60 percent clay.  Surface configuration in undisturbed areas is a succession of microbasins and microknolls that is repeated at intervals of 7 to 18 feet.  Microbasins are 4 to 10 inches lower than microknolls, range from 3 to 8 feet across, and occupy 35 to 45 percent of the pedon dimension.\nIn the microknolls--depth to the gray or mottled gray and brown upper part of the Bw horizon is 14 to 25 inches.  The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is 2 to 6 inches thick.  The upper part of the Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6; mottles in shades of gray or brown are few to many.  The lower part of the Bw horizon either is mottled in shades of gray and brown or has a gray matrix with mottles in shades of brown.\nIn the microbasins--depth to the gray or mottled gray and brown upper part of the Bw horizon is 6 to 16 inches thick.  The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1.  It is 6 to 16 inches thick.  The upper part of the Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2; mottles, if present, are in shades of brown.  The lower part of the Bw has the same color range as the Bw horizon in the microknolls.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5, and chroma of 4 to 6 with few to many mottles in shades of brown and gray, or it is mottled in shades of brown and gray.  It is silty clay or clay."

Naclina and Vamont soils have mean annual temperature of 65 degrees Fahrenheit or more.  In addition, Naclina soils have carbonates in lower part of the solum, and the Vamont has a solum more than 70 inches thick.  Beaumont and Garner soils are predominantly gray throughout.  Brooksville soils have a color value of less than 3.5 to a depth greater than 12 inches in more than 50 percent of the pedon.  Eutaw and Vaiden soils are very fine in the particle-size control section.  Kipling soils have an argillic horizon and do not have intersecting slickensides within a depth of 40 inches.  Morse soils do not have distinct or prominent mottles within a depth of 20 inches."
