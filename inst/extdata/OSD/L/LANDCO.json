  "OVERVIEW": "The Landco series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks with some volcanic ash.  Landco soils are on alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

The superactive cation exchange activity class was added to the taxonomic classification based on soil property data.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A and part of Cy1 horizons).\nMajor lithologic discontinuity - The abrupt change to clayey material at 46 cm (between the Cy2 and 2Cy3 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Cy2 and 2Cy3 horizons and parts of the Cy1 and 2Cy4 horizons)."
