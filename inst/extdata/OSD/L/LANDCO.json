The superactive cation exchange activity class was added to the taxonomic classification based on soil property data.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A and part of Cy1 horizons).\nMajor lithologic discontinuity - The abrupt change to clayey material at 46 cm (between the Cy2 and 2Cy3 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Cy2 and 2Cy3 horizons and parts of the Cy1 and 2Cy4 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
