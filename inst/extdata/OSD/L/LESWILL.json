    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F.  The product of the percentage of gypsum and the thickness in centimeters above a depth of 60 inches is less than 3,000.  Clay content in the particle-size control section is 27 to 35 percent, and the percent fine and coarser sand is less than 15 percent in the particle-size control section.  The gypsic horizon is at a depth of 10 to 40 inches and it contains 10 to 25 percent calcium sulfate.  The total of calcium sulfate plus calcium carbonate equivalent averages 20 to 39 percent by weight in the control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe B horizon, if present, has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 through 7, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Textures range from clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Textures are clay loam or silty clay loam."
