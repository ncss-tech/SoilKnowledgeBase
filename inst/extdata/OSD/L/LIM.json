  "OVERVIEW": "The Lim series consists of very deep, poorly drained loamy soils formed in alluvial sediments.  They are nearly level soils on flood plains and are subject to frequent flooding. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity ranges from moderately low to moderately high in the solum and high or very high in the substratum. Mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 46 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The depth to the coarse-textured layers ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  Gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent by volume in the surface layer, from 0 to 15 percent in the subsoil, and from 0 to 50 percent in the sandy substratum.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon and from strongly acid to neutral in the B and C horizons. Some subhorizon is moderately acid, slightly acid, or neutral within a depth of 40 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  It has weak or moderate granular structure and is friable or very friable.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Typically there are redoximorphic features.  Texture in the upper part of the B horizon is commonly silt loam or very fine sandy loam, but includes loam with more than 65 percent silt plus very fine sand.  Texture in the lower part of the B horizon is sandy loam or fine sandy loam, with more than 50 percent fine and coarser sand. Included in some pedons are thin Ab horizon strata.\nThe BC or CB horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture ranges from very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, sand, and coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. Included in some pedons are thin Ab horizon strata.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture ranges from loamy fine sand to coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction.  The underlying sandy layers are typically single grain and loose. Consistence is friable or very friable. The thickness and number of subhorizons is variable and corresponds to the thickness and variability of the alluvial deposits. Included in some pedons are thin Ab horizon strata."

Lim soils occupy similar positions as poorly drained Limerick soils which are in a drainage sequence with well drained Hadley, moderately well drained Winooski, and very poorly drained Saco soils.  Agawam, Enfield, Haven, Hinckley, Merrimac, Ninigret, Tisbury, and Windsor soils are better drained soils on nearby outwash terraces.  Occum soils are well drained loamy flood plain associates.  Suncook soils are excessively drained sandy soils on flood plains."
