  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The depth to the coarse-textured layers ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  Gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent by volume in the surface layer, from 0 to 15 percent in the subsoil, and from 0 to 50 percent in the sandy substratum.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon and from strongly acid to neutral in the B and C horizons. Some subhorizon is moderately acid, slightly acid, or neutral within a depth of 40 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  It has weak or moderate granular structure and is friable or very friable.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Typically there are redoximorphic features.  Texture in the upper part of the B horizon is commonly silt loam or very fine sandy loam, but includes loam with more than 65 percent silt plus very fine sand.  Texture in the lower part of the B horizon is sandy loam or fine sandy loam, with more than 50 percent fine and coarser sand. Included in some pedons are thin Ab horizon strata.\nThe BC or CB horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture ranges from very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, sand, and coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. Included in some pedons are thin Ab horizon strata.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture ranges from loamy fine sand to coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction.  The underlying sandy layers are typically single grain and loose. Consistence is friable or very friable. The thickness and number of subhorizons is variable and corresponds to the thickness and variability of the alluvial deposits. Included in some pedons are thin Ab horizon strata."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Briscot, Hockinson, and Rippowam soils. Briscot and Hockinson soils are from outside LRR R.\nBriscot and Hockinson soils have mean winter temperatures more than 32 degrees F. and mean summer precipitation less than 12 inches; the difference between mean summer soil temperature and mean winter soil temperature averages less than 25 degrees Fahrenheit. Rippowam soils have textures coarser than loam with less than 65 percent silt plus very fine sand in upper part of the subsoil."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lim soils are nearly level soils on flood plains along low gradient rivers and streams.  They are in relatively low areas.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in recent alluvium derived from a variety of crystalline and sedimentary rocks.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 54 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 50 inches, and the growing season ranges from 120 to 180 days."

Lim soils occupy similar positions as poorly drained Limerick soils which are in a drainage sequence with well drained Hadley, moderately well drained Winooski, and very poorly drained Saco soils.  Agawam, Enfield, Haven, Hinckley, Merrimac, Ninigret, Tisbury, and Windsor soils are better drained soils on nearby outwash terraces.  Occum soils are well drained loamy flood plain associates.  Suncook soils are excessively drained sandy soils on flood plains."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity ranges from moderately low to moderately high in the solum and high or very high in the substratum.  These soils flood frequently typically in the spring of each year."

Cation exchange activity class placement is based upon a review of limited lab data and similar and associated soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (A horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 6 to 29 inches (Bg1, Bg2, Bg3 and Bg4 horizons).\n3. Fluvaquentic subgroup has an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth and organic carbon which is greater than 0.2 percent within 1.25 meters.\n4. Nonacid reaction class the zone from 10 to 40 inches has neutral soil reaction (0.01 M CaCl2 (1:2))(Bg1, Bg2, Bg3 and Bg4 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
