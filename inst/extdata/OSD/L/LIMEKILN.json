    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at the lithic contact is 48 to 56 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days during summer and fall.  Depth to calcic horizon is 7 to 12 inches.  Depth to lithic contact is 10 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 45 to 70 percent angular basalt fragments.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 17 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  The A2 horizon is very cobbly silt loam, very stony silt loam, very cobbly loam, or very gravelly silt loam.\nThe Bkq horizon or Bk1 when present has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is very cobbly loam or very gravelly silt loam. Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bkq2 horizon or Bk2 horizon when present has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.  It is very cobbly loam, extremely cobbly loam, very cobbly silt loam, extremely cobbly silty loam, or extremely gravelly silt loam.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

These soils formed in loess and colluvium, and slope alluvium from basalt or greenstone.  Elevations range from 750 to 3,300 feet.  Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist.   The average annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 18 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 120 to 145 days and up to 190 days in Idaho."
