The soils formed in loess over residuum weathered from varicolored, calcareous shales, mostly of Permian age. The mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 14 degress C (50 to 58 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 660 to 860 mm (26 to 34 inches). Thornthwaites Annual PE Index ranges from 46 to 56."
