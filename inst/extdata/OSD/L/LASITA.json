  "OVERVIEW": "The Lasita series consists of moderately deep, well drained, soils that formed in loess over residuum weathered from calcareous shales. These soils are on hillslopes in uplands in MLRA 74 and 75.  Slopes range from 3 to 10 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 790 milimeters (31 inches).",
