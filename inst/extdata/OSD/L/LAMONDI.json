  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 26 inches thick.   Textures in the 10 to 40 inch section are gravelly, cobbly, very gravelly or very cobbly loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam, averaging 20 to 30 percent clay and 35 to 65 percent rock fragments.  Base saturation (by sum of cations) is less than 75 percent in some part or throughout the upper 30 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 43 degrees to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature ranges from 64 degrees to 69 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist, but are dry for 65 to 85 consecutive days during the summer.  Rock fragments consist of angular and rounded gravel, cobbles, and stones, and range from 20 to 55 percent in the A1 horizon, 45 to 70 percent in the B2 horizon, and 60 to 70 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.  It ranges from stony loam at the surface to cobbly loam, very cobbly loam, or gravelly loam in the lower part.  This horizon is medium acid to slightly acid and is 10 to 26 inches thick.\nThe B2 horizon has dominant hue of 10YR but has hue of 7.5YR in the lower part of some pedons, value of 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry, 3 and 4 moist.  It ranges from gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly to very cobbly loam, to gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly or very cobbly clay loam or very cobbly sandy clay loam.  This horizon is medium to slightly acid, and ranges from 25 to 40 inches thick.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It ranges from very gravelly loam or clay loam to very cobbly loam, very cobbly sandy loam, or very cobbly loamy sand and is medium or slightly acid."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lamondi soils are at elevations of 5,100 to 7,000 feet.  They occur on sloping to steep alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium weathered from argillite, phyllite, schist and quartzite.  The climate is moist subhumid, and the average annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 25 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 F.  The mean summer temperature is 60 degrees to 65 degrees F., and the frost-free period ranges from 70 to 100 days."
