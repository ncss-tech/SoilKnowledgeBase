  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  The soil ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in all horizons.  Base saturation by sum of cations at 50 inches below the upper boundary of the B horizon ranges from 38 to 50 percent.  Calcium-magnesium ratio is 1 or more in the lower part of the B horizon.  The particle-size control section, the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon, has 18 to 27 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.\nThe Bw horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Some pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6, or it has hue 2.5Y value of 6, and chroma of 4.  Mottles having chroma of 2 or less are in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe B part of the B/E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 6, chroma of 1 to 6, with few to many mottles in shades of brown and yellow; or, it is mottled in shades of yellow, gray, and brown.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam, and is commonly slightly brittle and compact.  The E part has hue to 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; the E part is silty material interfingered between peds of the B part."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Vick is the only competing series.  Closely related series are the Askew, Bude, Duralde, Frizzell, Glenmora, Pheba, Prentiss, and Tippo series.  Vick soils have a clayey 2B horizon.  The Askew soils do not have interfingering of albic material into the argillic horizon and have mixed mineralogy.  The Bude, Pheba, and Prentiss soils have a fragipan; also Bude soils have mixed mineralogy; Pheba soils are coarse-silty in the control section; and Prentiss soils are coarse-loamy in the control section.  The Duralde, Frizzell, and Tippo soils have tongues or interfingering of albic material in the argillic horizon, but they differ from Longview soils, in part, in that Duralde soils have mixed mineralogy, and Frizzell and Tippo soils have a coarse-silty particle-size class.  Glenmora soils have reddish mottles in the lower part of the Bt horizon."

These are nearly level to gently sloping soils; slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The climate is warm and humid.  Mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 51 inches near the type location."

Somewhat poorly drained Pheba soils are in similar landscape positions as the Longview soils, and moderately well drained Prentiss soils are on slightly higher terrain.  Poorly drained Adaton soils, which are in nearby depressions, have a gray matrix in more than 60 percent of the mass between the A horizon and 30 inches depth.  Somewhat poorly drained Falkner soils, which are on adjacent convex slopes of low relief, do not have a B/E horizon and do have a clayey 2Bt horizon.  Somewhat poorly drained Stough soils, which are on nearby terraces, have a coarse-loamy control section."
