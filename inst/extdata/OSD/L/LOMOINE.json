  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lomoine series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rock or welded rhyolitic tuff. Lomoine soils are on mountains, hills, and rock pediments. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
