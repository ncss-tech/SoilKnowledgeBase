They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from slightly metamorphosed granitic rocks or welded rhyolitic tuff. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 1,400 to 2,290 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 130 days."
