  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 60 or more inches. The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid.  Content of weathered phosphatic pebbles, nodules of ironstone, or fragments of siliceous rock, 2 to 76 mm in size, range from 0 to 5 percent by volume in the solum.  Plinthite occurs in the Bt horizon in some pedons and ranges from 1 to 5 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 4 or 5.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Mottles are in shades of brown, yellow, or gray.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe Bt1 and Bt2 horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Mottles are in shades of gray, red and yellow.   Texture of the Bt1 horizon ranges from loamy sand to very fine sandy loam.  Texture of the Bt2 horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Content of clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon is 15 to 30 percent.\nThe Btg and BCg horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or they are neutral with value of 5 or 6.  Texture of the Btg horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Mottles are in shades of brown, red, or yellow.  The BCg horizon is a sandy clay loam or sandy clay with few fine lenses of fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand in some pedons. In some pedons the texture is fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam, with or without a few fine pockets and lenses of loamy fine sand.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 4 or 5.  It is commonly mottled in shades of brown, red, or yellow.  Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam and has common, medium lenses of sandy loam or loamy sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Lochloosa soils are on nearly level to sloping landscapes in the Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in thick beds of sandy and loamy marine sediments.  Average annual precipitation is about 50 to 60 inches and mean annual temperature is about 70 to 74 degrees F."

Blichton, Bivans, Boardman, Flemington, Kanapaha, and Wacahoota soils are all poorly drained.  Hague soils are well drained.  Micanopy soils are clayey within 20 inches of the soil surface.  Millhopper and Sparr soils are sandy to a depth of 40 inches or more."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; slow permeability.  The water table is at depths of 30 to 60 inches for periods of 1 to 4 months during most years.  It rises to depths of about 15 inches for 1 to 3 weeks.  It recedes to depths of more than 60 inches during the drier seasons.  Wetness in these soils on slopes is caused by seepage."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of these soils are cleared.  Tame pasture is the dominant use of these areas.  Some cleared areas are used for corn, citrus, peanuts, tomatoes, and watermelons.  Native vegetation consists of slash and loblolly pine, dogwood, hickory, live, laurel and water oak, sweetgum, red maple, and magnolia.  The understory is waxmyrtle, briars, and native grasses."
