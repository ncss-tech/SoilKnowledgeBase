  "OVERVIEW": "The Lemm series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium or colluvium derived mainly from granitic or rhyolitic rock. Lemm soils are on alluvial fans or concave colluvial slopes.  Slopes range from 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
