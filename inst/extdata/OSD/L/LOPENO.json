  "OVERVIEW": "The Lopeno series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, rapid permeable soils on convex mounds or dunes in deflation flats of active or recently active dune complexes.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils formed in sandy eolian sediments of Holocene age overlying loamy eolian deposits of Quaternary age.  Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).",
