Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 2,000 to 4,000 feet.  The climate is warm and arid.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 3 to 9 inches.  The mean annual temperature is between 60 and 65 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 190 to 210 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Canutio, Longjim, and Pinez soils.  Canutio soils are formed in recent alluvium, lack argillic horizons, or duripans, and have a loamy-skeletal control section.  The Longjim soil lacks an argillic horizon and is generally on convex, steeper sites above the Lealandic series.  Pinez soils are on mid-fan remnants and have loamy-skeletal control sections."
