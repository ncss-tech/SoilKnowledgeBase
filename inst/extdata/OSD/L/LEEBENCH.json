  "OVERVIEW": "The Leebench series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly or moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Leebench soils occur on alluvial fans, fan remnants, strath terraces, stream terraces, alluvial flats, and fan terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
