  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "DHC/SSP",
  "REVDATE": "11/1999",
  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lagarita series consist of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from andesite, rhyolite, breccia, or tuff.  These soils are on alluvial fans and mountain footslopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
