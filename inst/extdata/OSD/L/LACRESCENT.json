  "STATES": "IL,IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Lacrescent series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 12 to 50 centimeters of loess or a mixture of loess and loamy colluvium and in loamy-skeletal colluvial sediments from bedrock.  Lacrescent soils are on convex slopes on steep and very steep hill slopes in dissected uplands.  Slope ranges from 5 to 90 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 977 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
