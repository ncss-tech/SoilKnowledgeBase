These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 80 consecutive days during the summer.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  Depth to fractured shale ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  Depth to solid, coherent bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Hue of the solum commonly is 10YR but ranges to 7.5YR. It has 35 to 75 percent shale fragments throughout.  The solum has 10 to 30 percent glass and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.3 to 0.7 percent.\nThe upper part of the A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is ashy loam with 18 to 27 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent flagstones and 35 to 65 percent channers.  Base saturation by sum is 65 to 75 percent.\nThe lower part of the A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is ashy loam or ashy clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay.  It has 0 to 20 percent flagstone and 35 to 60 percent channers."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Laycock soils are on hillsides.  Elevations are 3,500 to 5,500 feet on north slopes but can range up to 6,600 feet on south slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  These soils were dominantly formed in very shaly colluvium weathered from fractured shale interbedded in places with sandstone and graywacke.  Less common are the soils formed in highly fractured, flaggy and channery rhyolite.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 17 to 22 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F., the mean July temperature is about 63 degrees F., and the mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 30 to 80 days."

Hankins soils are very deep and have a clayey, argillic horizon.  McGarr soils are fine-loamy and 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Piersonte soils are very deep.  Tolo soils are very deep and are ashy over loamy."
