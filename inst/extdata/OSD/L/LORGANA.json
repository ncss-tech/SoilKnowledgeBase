  "OVERVIEW": "The Lorgana series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite.  Lorgana soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 640 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
