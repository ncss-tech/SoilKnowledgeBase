These soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from limestone and dolomite. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,440 to 3,360 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 560 to 760 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days."
