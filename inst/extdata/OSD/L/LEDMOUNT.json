  "OVERVIEW": "The Ledmount series consists of shallow, well to somewhat excessively drained soils formed in material weathered from andesitic tuff breccia. These soils are on mountains and have slopes of 2 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 1345 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 11 degrees C.",

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ledmount soils are on backslopes, shoulders and summits of lahars at elevations of 1190 to 1950 meters. They formed in material weathered from andesitic tuff breccia. Outcrops of breccia are common. The climate has cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. Annual precipitation ranges from 1170 to 1930 mm, of which 8 to 30 percent falls as snow. Mean annual air temperature is 11 degrees C. Average January temperature is 1 degrees C, average July temperature is about 21 degrees C. Frost-free season is about 130 to 210 days."

All except Iron Mountain are greater than 50 cm to a root-restrictive bedrock contact and occur on lahars. Aiken, Cohasset, Crozier, Devilsnose, Lilygap and Redapple have argillic horizons. Iron Mountain, Aiken, Cohasset, Crozier and Redapple lack andic soil properties in 60 percent or more of the upper 60 cm. McCarthy and Devilsnose are on higher and steeper portions of flanks of lahars (on shoulders and backslopes), often closely intermingled with Iron Mountain. McCarthy has more than 35 percent rock fragments throughout. Aiken, Lilygap and Redappple occur on backslopes, footslopes and summits of lahars."
