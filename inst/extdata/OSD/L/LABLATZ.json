Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and depth to free carbonates range from 40 to 70 inches. The weighted average clay content ranges from 8 to 18 percent and the weighted average content of fine sand or coarser ranges from 35 to 65 percent in the particle-size control section. Rock fragments are a mixture of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary. The sedimentary rocks are mostly dolomite. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the soil and volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum and very strongly acid to neutral in the lower part. Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline in the substratum. Redox features are in the albic or spodic horizon within a depth of 20 inches. Saturation occurs within 20 inches for some time in most years.\nThe O horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or 2. It is highly decomposed plant material.\nSome pedons have a thin A horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2. It is fine sandy loam.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nLablatz soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both). The E part has color and texture like the E' horizon above. The Bt part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 to 6. Typically, it is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam, but thin subhorizons of sandy clay loam are in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.

Soils in different famlies (superactive activity class) are the Moodig, Mudlake, Pesabic, Riggsville, and Worwood series. Moodig and Mudlake soils lack  carbonates in the lower part of the series control section.  Mudlake soils also have a 12 to 40 inch thick silty mantle in the upper part of the series control section. Pesabic soils have dense till (Cd) at a depth of 40 to 70 inches. Riggsville soils are sandy in the upper 17 to 27 inches of the series control section. Worwood soils have more than 85 percent sand within a depth of 40 inches and have stratified loamy and sandy textures within 60 inches."
