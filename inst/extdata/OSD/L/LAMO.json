Soils previously mapped as a wet phase are now included in the Obert series.\nA saline-alkali phase has been mapped that allows SAR of 6 to 9 and electrical conductivity of 2 to 8 mmhos/cm in the lower part of the series control section (substratum); a sandy substratum phase is recognized that allows coarse sand and gravelly sand at depths below 40 inches\nOSD Modification RRZ 7/2002; added EC (mmhos/cm: 0 to 2 to A horizons; added coarse material below 60 inches and sandy material below 40 inches (sandy substratum phase)\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon--the zone from 0 to 26 inches and aquic soil conditions--the zone from 26 to 80 inches (Bg1, Bg2 and Cg horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
