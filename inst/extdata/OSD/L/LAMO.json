  "OVERVIEW": "The Lamo series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous loamy alluvium.  The soils have moderately slow permeability.  These soils are on flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 27 inches at the type location.",

    "content": "REMARKS:  In early surveys, Lamo soils were correlated in the Lamoure series.  To date, phases recognized are sandy substratum, drained, saline, and alkali.  Soils previously mapped as a wet phase are now included in the Obert series.\nA saline-alkali phase has been mapped that allows SAR of 6 to 9 and electrical conductivity of 2 to 8 mmhos/cm in the lower part of the series control section (substratum); a sandy substratum phase is recognized that allows coarse sand and gravelly sand at depths below 40 inches\nOSD Modification RRZ 7/2002; added EC (mmhos/cm: 0 to 2 to A horizons; added coarse material below 60 inches and sandy material below 40 inches (sandy substratum phase)\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon--the zone from 0 to 26 inches and aquic soil conditions--the zone from 26 to 80 inches (Bg1, Bg2 and Cg horizons)."
