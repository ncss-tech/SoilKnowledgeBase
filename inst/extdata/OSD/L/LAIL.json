Rock fragments are typically less than 5 percent and range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 degrees to 46 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 40 degrees to 58 degrees F.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, and 4 through 6 moist and chroma of 2 through 4. Textures are silt loam or loam. It is slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe E/B horizon has the same range in properties as the respective E and Bt horizons. The E portion of this horizon forms tongues and interfingers which surround the remnant Bt portions.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 5YR through 10R, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. This horizon is usually clay or silty clay but clay ranges from 35 to 50 percent, silt from 15 to 50 percent, and sand from 10 to 45 percent. It is slightly acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R. It contains about 6 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, with consistent visible secondary accumulation. This horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
