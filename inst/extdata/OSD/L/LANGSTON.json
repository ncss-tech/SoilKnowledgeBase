  "OVERVIEW": "The Langston series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Langston soils are on fan remnants and lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
