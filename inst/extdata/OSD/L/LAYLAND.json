Organic surface horizons are very strongly acid to moderately acid n reaction.\nOther soil features: The particle size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay.

The preponderance of data from a variety of pedons sampled as members of the Highsplint series in southern West Virginia indicated a need for the establishment of this series. The pedons sampled are derived from early Pennsylvanian parent materials, specifically the New River Formation of the Pottsville Series.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nCharacterization data from the NSSL is available for this pedon: Pedon ID: 01N1146 (S01WV019001). Other valuable reference pedons available from the NSSL (http://ssldata.nrcs.usda.gov/querypage.asp): 01N1139 and 01N1153.\nNASIS User Pedon ID: S01WV019001\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
