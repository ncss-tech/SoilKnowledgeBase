    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This draft reflects a change in classification from medial over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Andic Xerochrepts to coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed Aquic Haplorthods.  Characterization data are available on these soils.  Laboratory numbers S81WA-073-6 and S81WA-073-18.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the surface to 9 inches, a spodic horizon from 9 to 23 inches, and an abrupt textural change at 23 inches.  The spodic horizon does not meet chemical criteria for a spodic horizon but does have micro morphology of a spodic horizon, i.e. cracked coatings and silt-sized and larger pellets.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
