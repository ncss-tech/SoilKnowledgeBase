  "OVERVIEW": "The Lineville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess and loamy sediments over till.  These soils are on convex ridges and narrow interfluves on dissected till plains.  Slope ranges from 2 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 950 centimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
