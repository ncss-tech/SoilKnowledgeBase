  "OVERVIEW": "The Longval series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial outwash and alluvium derived from volcanic rocks and volcanic ash.  Longval soils are on toeslopes of mountains and plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: In January 2004 the taxonomic class was updated from Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Vitrandic Dystrocryepts.  The isotic mineralogy class, volcanic glass content, and oxalate aluminum plus one-half iron values are estimated based on properties of similar soils in major land resource area 21.  Future study is needed to verify the isotic mineralogy class and the vitrandic intergrade features.\nDecember 2004, redescribed a profile near the original location and changed the classification from Coarse-loamy, isotic Vitrandic Dystrocryepts to Ashy-skeletal, glassy Humic Xeric Vitricryands.  This revision is based on current field mapping to better represent the soil as mapped.\nEarlier authors and editors of the OSD include: LNL/LWW/SBJ/JVC.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 32 inches (A1,A2 and AB horizons).\nAndic soil properties - The soil material with high volcanic glass content and acid oxalate extractable Al and  Fe more than .4 extends from the mineral soil surface to 60 inches (A1 A2, AB, C1 and C2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from the mineral soil surface to 40 inches (A1, A2, AB and part of the C1 horizons)."
