  "OVERVIEW": "The Ladybug series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from metasedimentary rock. The Ladybug soils are on mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 895 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
