  "OVERVIEW": "The Littlered series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from ultrabasic intrusive rocks.  Littlered soils are on mountains and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 65 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.",
